    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    We'll hear argument next in Case 09-1498, United States v. Tinklenberg. 
    Mr. Roberts.
speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="5.987" stopTime="75.298">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    Thank you. 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    To accommodate important pretrial proceedings, the Speedy Trial Act contains several automatic exclusions from its deadline for commencing trial. 
    This case concerns the exclusion for pretrial motions, which excludes the period of delay resulting from any pretrial motion from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on or other prompt disposition of such motion. 
    For more than 30 years, the courts of appeals had uniformly held that the exclusion applies automatically upon the filing of any motion, regardless of its effect on the trial schedule. 
    The court below correctly rejected that established rule, which accords with this Court's decisions, is clear and easy to administer, and has worked well for over 3 decades. 
    The Court's cases construing the exclusion, Henderson and Bloate, support the established rule. 
    They make clear that the exclusion applies automatically once a motion is filed without any need for district court findings. 
    Henderson and Bloate cannot be squared with the approach of Respondent and the court below.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="75.298" stopTime="86.939">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    Well, all that might be true. 
    On the other hand, the statute does say "delay resulting". 
    And under your approach, the time would be excluded even if delay does not result.
speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="86.939" stopTime="123.395">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    No, Your Honor. 
    Delay refers to the interval of time from the filing of the motion through its disposition, during which the Speedy Trial Act's deadline is tolled. 
    We know that delay has the meaning -- delay can often have the meaning of the interval of time between two events. 
    And we know it has that meaning in the statute here because subsection (D) tells us so. 
    It defines the period of excludable delay resulting from the motion as the time from the filing through the disposition of the motion. 
    Respondent's definition--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="123.395" stopTime="133.503">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But the Chief Justice says only if it -- it's really a circular argument -- only if it results in a delay. 
    Well, suppose it doesn't result in a delay?
speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="133.503" stopTime="179.416">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    --That's assuming that delay is referring to delay of the trial, to a postponement in the trial. 
    But delay can't have that meaning because if it has that -- if that meaning is inconsistent with subsection (D) of the statute's exclusion of the time, of saying that delay is the time from the filing of the motion through the disposition of the motion, because the statute excludes periods of delay. 
    And if delay meant postponement of the trial, then the excluded period would be the time during which trial is postponed, but that period is often significantly shorter or longer than the time from the filing of the motion to the disposition. 
    And in Henderson and Bloate--
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="179.416" stopTime="190.506">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But that doesn't -- that prove the point that I think is the concern of the Chief Justice's question, that in some cases the delay -- there's a delay that results and in other cases there isn't.
speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="190.506" stopTime="295.859">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    --But, Your Honor, the statute excludes the period of delay, and then it says the period of delay is the time from the filing through the disposition. 
    If delay -- if delay means postponement of the trial, then all that's excluded by the statute in the first part is the -- is the time during which trial is postponed, but that doesn't match up with subsection (D) because that period is not necessarily the period from the filing through the disposition. 
    If I could give you an example. 
    Say a motion is filed 14 days before trial could begin, and the motion takes 16 days to resolve. 
    Trial is postponed only by two days. 
    And so if delay means the postponement of trial, then the period of delay should be 2 days, but the statute says that the delay and the excludable time is the time from the filing through the disposition, which is 16 days. 
    And that's what this Court held in Henderson and Bloate, that that's the exact time. 
    So if you adopt a definition of delay for the first part as a triggering mechanism that's the postponement of trial, that doesn't line up with the rest of the statute. 
    In addition, that would be a totally unworkable rule because whether time is excludable would turn on a complex and often uncertain analysis of whether the motion would or could delay when trial would begin, and it's often going to be difficult or impossible to make that determination at the time that the motion is filed.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="295.859" stopTime="319.058">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Roberts, is there -- is there any, anything to indicate that what Congress might have had in mind is that in criminal cases inevitably there are going to be motions, and so the trial judge is likely to set the trial date for after that period runs?
speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="319.058" stopTime="473.558">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    Yes, Your Honor. 
    Sometimes trial -- judges might take motions into account in setting the trial date and other times they might not take the motions into account. 
    So a rule that -- that said the exclusion only applies if the judge moves the trial date in response to the motion would lead to arbitrary results. 
    It would mean basically that whether time was excludable depended on whether the judge took the motions into account when it set the trial date initially or whether the, whether the judge correctly estimated the amount of time. 
    And also sometimes motions may be filed when no trial date is set, so the rule would be totally unworkable in that situation. 
    And Respondent, in one of his formulations for what the test might be, suggests that a motion wouldn't create excludable delay unless it would postpone the hypothetical earliest date on which trial could otherwise begin. 
    That's just a totally unworkable rule, because to divine that hypothetical date, courts would have to assess the effect of multiple different factors that could affect when trial would begin, such as: How much time do the parties and the counsel need for factual investigation and legal analysis? 
    How long is discovery going to take? 
    There would be numerous questions that would arise about how to apply those factors. 
    For example, the courts would have to decide: Should they take potential obstacles to an earlier trial as given, or should they instead think about whether those obstacles could be eliminated? 
    The courts would also have to figure out what to do if the earliest possible trial date changed between when the motion was filed and when the motion was resolved. 
    And how would they take into account other periods of time that might exclude delay -- might exclude -- that might be excludable also? 
    For example, say a court gets two motions filed at the same time. 
    Trial could start in 5 days absent the motion. 
    One motion's going to take 3 days to resolve; the other motion's going to take 4 days to resolve. 
    What's the court supposed to do? 
    Is one -- is the 3-day motion excluded? 
    Is the 4-day motion excluded? 
    Are both of the motions excluded? 
    Does it depend on the order in which the court decides them? 
    It just is not possible for a court to make these determinations.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="473.558" stopTime="499.292">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    You said at the outset that things have been working fine. 
    Of course, the whole point of the Act was to hold district judges to a pretty strict standard, and the concern is that there might be a very complex case the judge just really wants to put off as long as possible and will continue to accept motion after motion. 
    Is there anything I can -- I can read or consult to show that this has been working very well and that there's not a problem?
speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="499.292" stopTime="540.536">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    Well, I -- I can't point to anything particular, but there's been no outcry that -- that there's been a problem from pretrial motions being filed as a -- as an attempt to extend the Speedy Trial Act deadline. 
    The court's been -- the -- Congress has reviewed the Speedy Trial Act's operation in the past. 
    It made changes in 1979 to address problems that have occurred. 
    It hasn't felt the need to address this problem since, and there's no evidence of any abuse of the automatic exclusion on the other side.

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Counsel, on that issue, do you accept the First Circuit's rule in U.S. v. Hood that if the government is found to be attempting to frustrate the operation of the Speedy Trial Act, that those motions and their delays won't be counted?
speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="558.997" stopTime="566.936">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    Well, first, Your Honor, I don't think that -- that Hood adopted any such rule. 
    The motion--

    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    --It suggests that there might be that qualification. 
    I think that the statute provides that the -- that any pretrial motion tolls the deadline, regardless of the purpose for which it's filed. 
    But, of course, if -- in the unlikely event that a prosecutor did file a motion solely to extend the deadline and avoid proceeding to trial, that conduct would be sanctionable under -- under the Act, under section 3162(b)(4).

speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="615.501" stopTime="641.818">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    You haven't answered my question. 
    The rights that this statute protects are the rights to have your trial start within 70 days absent or extended to these exclusions. 
    If the government frustrates that and makes the trial start later, why shouldn't a defendant have the benefit of the Act and have the indictment dismissed with or without prejudice?
speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="641.818" stopTime="684.411">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    --Well, the statute provides the circumstances in which time is excludable and in which time is not, and it doesn't create an exception for certain kinds of motions. 
    It applies to any pretrial motion. 
    But I have to say, there's been no evidence over the 30 years that anything like this is happening, and in Hood itself, the motion was filed by defense counsel, and the court was simply saying that this is not -- that that's not what's going on here, there's no suggestion that this motion is part of a process to try to frustrate the Act. 
    There's -- the problem just hasn't arisen.

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Counsel, I hope you won't sit down without addressing the (h)(1)(F) issue and explain why we shouldn't reach it, because the issue is, as I see it, one of law, not like Nobles, one of discretion. 
    And although you say it's unimportant because of a change in Rule 45, how could any criminal conviction that's inappropriate be unimportant to the defendant or insignificant enough for this Court to address the question once the case is before us?
speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="725.472" stopTime="781.892">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    Well, the Court -- the Court does decline to address questions if it doesn't consider them of sufficient importance to -- general importance to warrant a review. 
    Nobles is one example. 
    There are others cited in Stern and Gressman. 
    But the reason that this issue is not of any ongoing importance is that the rules have been amended. 
    It now expressly applies to statutes like this one that don't specify a method for counting time. 
    And, you know, turning to the merits of the issue, also -- one other point on the importance of it. 
    The circuits all have adopted the same approach as the Court of Appeals here, and--

    So I think what you're saying is that the interpretation of the statute tracks with Rule 45, Rule 45 formerly was calendar -- was business days, it is now calendar days, there is conformity. 
    And plus, 45, and that was at least laid on the table of Congress, so they know that it was there.

    --Yes, Your Honor.

    And so there's no -- there's no new rule; at the time the 10 days meant exclude the weekends and holidays, and now because the background rule has changed, it means count the weekends, and--

    In fact, courts frequently do that when they're trying to interpret statutes to figure out what the 10-day limit is/as many of the -- many of the cases cited in the ALR article that Respondent cites show.

    When you're trying -- when you're trying to figure out -- when you're dealing with procedural rules that involve filing things in court, it was once thought to make sense to exclude weekends because things couldn't be filed on the weekends, but when you're talking about transporting a prisoner. 
    What sense does it make to exclude the weekend? 
    Does this--

    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts

speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="1511.399" stopTime="1599.290">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    --Yes, Your Honor, generally the flights don't occur on the weekends or holidays. 
    That was sort of what I was trying to explain in my extended digression to the Chief -- to the Chief Justice before. 
    The BOP doesn't admit and discharge prisoners on the weekends. 
    In addition, there are various other factors that -- that go into the need to have two -- two deputy marshals transporting people. 
    So the transportation doesn't generally occur on the weekends. 
    And it's because of the weekends and holidays that the transportation of the defendant actually took the amount of time that it -- that it did here. 
    But I would say, as I started, in urging you not to address this issue, which is of no ongoing importance, that the question that we did ask the Court to address and that the Court granted review on is a very important question that's divided the circuits; and that allowing the rule that the court below adopted to continue to stand could frustrate the application of the Speedy Trial Act, not only with respect to the pretrial motions exclusion but potentially with respect to all the other automatic exclusions; and I think it's very important that the Court correct this error and reaffirm the established rule. 
    If I could reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

   Argument of Jeffrey L. Fisher
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="1607.194" stopTime="1660.293">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: 
    Before turning to the substance, I would like to, if I may, start with the procedural question that Justice Sotomayor raised and that -- and that my opponent just completed with, because I want to be sure there's no confusion on the posture of this case. 
    In particular, this Court's precedents squarely reject the notion that there's any history in this Court's precedents for refusing to reach an argument in this posture. 
    In particular, in Langness v. Green, 282 U.S. 531, this Court held in 1931 that a Respondent's, quote, "right" to defend a judgment below on a ground that is properly preserved all along and that the lower court reached and rejected is, quote, "beyond successful challenge". 
    Now, I'm not sure -- I'm not aware of any exception from that rule in the 80 years since.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1660.293" stopTime="1685.194">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Suppose the petition here had simply raised one question, and that is the question of how you count time under -- under a version of Rule 45 of the Federal Rules Of Criminal Procedure that is not -- no longer in effect and as to which there is no conflict in the circuits. 
    How would you grade the chances of the Court taking cert on that?
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="1685.194" stopTime="1838.123">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    Well, I'll take your hypothetical, Justice Alito, but I do want to be able to correct the notion that it's of no longer continuing importance. 
    But I'll assume that your hypothetical on that kind of a question would be cert denied. 
    But that's never been an obstacle to reaching the question. 
    Let me give you two things that are very important here. 
    The first is the problem with the Government's citation to Nobles is not just a distinction between discretion and law. 
    If you look at the Solicitor General's own reply brief in that case, it pointed out that the problem with the alternative argument there was that it would give the defendant different relief. 
    So it was therefore subject to the cross-petitions rule, and that's the section in Stern and Gressman that's cited in their briefs. 
    Those are the only two citations they have, the citations to Nobles and the citations to Stern and Gressman, which are all about cross-petitions when the defendant wants different relief. 
    We want exactly the same relief. 
    We want a dismissal on the Speedy Trial Act. 
    So finally, even if it were somehow discretionary and this Court were to consider in this case breaking from its unbroken precedent of 80 years -- let me give you one more example before I turn to the discretionary. 
    In the Walling case in 1947, this Court reached as an alternative ground the defendant's argument that there was insufficient evidence. 
    Now, that's sort of the quintessential un-cert-worthy question, but this Court felt required to reach it because the lower court had reached it and rejected it and the defendant had preserved it all along in that case. 
    And in the Union Pacific case in 2009 -- I can keep giving you citations. 
    But let me just say, even if it were discretionary, you would still want to reach it in this case, because at pages 18 and 19 of the Solicitor General's brief there are citations to a circuit split on this issue. 
    And the new Rule 45 hasn't made that go away for two reasons. 
    The first is because the Solicitor General's own argument now doesn't depend on Rule 45. 
    Instead, it's that the Speedy Trial Act on its own terms counts 10 business days, not simply calendar days. 
    And, second, there continue to be decisions after the amendment of Rule 45 in which lower courts have said that this provision means only 10 business days. 
    Let me give you one more citation, and forgive me for this because we didn't get to file a reply brief in this case on this issue. 
    But the Zabawa case, 2010 Westlaw, 307-5044, is a case in the Eastern District of Michigan last summer where the Government's own filing, which we looked at on PACER, asked the court to apply Tinklenberg and hold that subsection (F) meant only ten business days.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="1838.123" stopTime="1865.726">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    If I could just come back to where you started before you go on to these additional points. 
    Your argument is that if the Government petitions for cert on one issue that's a legal issue on which there's a conflict in the circuits and the Respondent in a criminal case says that the -- asks to have the decision below affirmed on 15 other grounds, we -- and raises those in the bio, we take the case anyway, we are duty-bound to decide every one of those 15 grounds?
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="1865.726" stopTime="1975.780">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    You're not duty-bound to decide it, Justice Alito. 
    But I do think under this Court's precedent, at least, you have never reversed the decision below without reaching them. 
    So you may well affirm on the question presented or some one or two of those questions. 
    You may also dismiss the case as improvidently granted, which happens sometimes in these circumstances. 
    Of course, what ordinarily what would happen is when the cert -- when the ops was filed this Court would realize there was a serious obstacle to reaching the question and might well deny cert in the first place. 
    But as I said, there's no decision on this Court's books and certainly the Solicitor General hasn't appointed one where you've reversed and reinstated a conviction or, in fact, reversed and done anything to a Respondent in these circumstances. 
    Now, let me turn to the merits of the ten day argument and make a few points before I'm sure the Court might want to talk about the pretrial motions issue as well. 
    There's a few important points to make. 
    Now, remember, the Solicitor General has now basically abandoned the Sixth Circuit's view that Rule 45 automatically gets incorporated into the Speedy Trial Act and now they're making the making the argument that what Congress intended in the Speedy Trial Act was somehow for Rule 45 to operate as some background principle. 
    So that the meaning of the Act, I guess, would wax and wane according to what Rule 45 said. 
    Now, there's two versions of this argument. 
    I can't tell which it's making. 
    First it could be saying that what Congress meant when it passed subsection F in 1979 was that whatever the rule is in Rule 45 right now, that's what we expect to be applied. 
    Well, that can't possibly be the Solicitor General's argument because in 1979 Rule 45, consistent with the traditional rule, excluded weekends and holidays only for periods of less than seven days. 
    That wasn't changed until 1985. 
    So the Congress at the time, even if they had cared about Rule 45, wouldn't have, wouldn't have thought you counted, excluded weekends and holidays here.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="1975.780" stopTime="1993.076">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Why wouldn't Congress think, we have a bunch of statutes that have times and we have a bunch that don't and the ones that don't, they should be interpreted into the Federal rule, that Rule 45?
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="1993.076" stopTime="2067.724">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    I think the much more natural reading, Justice Ginsburg, in light of the traditional rule, which is not just cited in Am. 
    Jur. 
    , please understand, this is a cannon of common law, traditional construction of time periods that goes back to Sutherland's treatise in 1904. 
    There's a Second Circuit case called Morasca in 1921, 277 F. 2727, I could cite you 20 or 30 state cases all up and down the last century. 
    So the common law rule has always been for periods of less than seven days -- I'm sorry, for periods of more than seven days, it's up to the legislature to expressly tell the court to exclude weekends and holidays. 
    And if you look at the U.S. Code, it's perfectly consistent with that common law understanding because when Congress wanted, such as in the Bail Reform Act, to exclude weekends and holidays from a ten day period, it expressly says so. 
    Now, we cited three or four examples in our brief. 
    Again, this is at page 40, 41 of our brief. 
    I could have cited 15 or 20. 
    So the U.S. Code is quite clear and I think the much more natural inference its that when Congress wanted to exclude weekends and holidays consistent with the traditional rule, it felt duty bound to say so in the U.S. Code, and when it hasn't, it wants simply calendar days -- now, if you want confirmation.

    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    It does now, but two things are telling about the 2009 amendments. 
    The first is that when it switched to statutes, it reverted to counting calendar days.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Regardless of the 2009?
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2099.476" stopTime="2139.081">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    That's right, that's right. 
    But if you want to talk about Congressional intent, I don't think we have to even go there. 
    But, remember, after the -- in 2009 there's also a Federal law, the Technical Amendments Statutory Act made a hash of that. 
    But Congress went through, most recently about a year and a half ago, and amended various provisions of the U.S. Code according to whether it wanted weekends or holidays excluded or times enlarged, and it left this alone. 
    So I think every indicia of evidence you can look at from every possible angle shows that ten days meant ten days at the time of the trial, and that's enough to affirm the judgment. 
    The last point I'll make concerning--
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2139.081" stopTime="2149.639">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Congress thought about the Speedy Trial Act when it made those technical amendments, isn't it likely to have thought the courts had interpreted it as excluding the weekends up to that point?
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2149.639" stopTime="2153.591">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    --No, my point, Justice Alito, is Congress didn't think of the Speedy Trial Act, it didn't do anything with the Speedy Trial Act.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2153.591" stopTime="2154.591">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    Didn't think about -- okay.
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2154.591" stopTime="2209.760">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    Well, maybe we leave that where it was, but let me make one final point that I think is the clincher here. 
    Remember, we have not just this alternative argument, we have a second alternative argument, which is that the time in relation to Mr. Tinklenberg's competency hearing exceeded the 30 day provision in section 4247 in the Insanity Defense Reform Act. 
    Now, I don't think you have to get to that argument, you can simply affirm on the ten day issue, but, again, let's think about what the Solicitor General is arguing with respect to the ten day issue. 
    They're saying that Congress sub silentio, without saying anything at all in the Speedy Trial Act, somehow assumed that the time in subsection F would wax and wane according to this rule. 
    Well, if that's -- even though the rule didn't even apply to statutes at the time. 
    Well, if that's the case, then I don't think there's any basis for arguing that Congress would have had exactly the same assumption with respect to another Federal statute, that is the Insanity Defense Reform Act.
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2209.760" stopTime="2218.033">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    And if we don't agree with you on your Rule 45 argument, you say we would have to reach this third argument, right?
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2218.033" stopTime="2239.280">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    Yes. 
    So I think the only way -- somehow, you've accepted the Solicitor General's argument, which I don't think you can, but if you did accept it on merits, it runs headlong into our third argument, which the Solicitor General takes exactly the opposite position, which is, the Speedy Trial Act is its own self-contained universe that doesn't incorporate any other statutes or any other provisions of law.

    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    Right. 
    And I think, Justice Ginsburg, as to your -- your question, I'll just leave it to this Court's best discretion how it wants to handle that issue. 
    Now, Justice Kennedy, let me turn to the merits. 
    We think this is a straightforward case where the text dictates the outcome of the case. 
    Remember, the key words in the statute are "delay resulting from", and I think the -- I think the ordinary meaning, in fact, the only meaning, of "delay" is a hindrance to progress or a postponement. 
    So it's--
speaker="john_g_roberts_jr" startTime="2335.191" stopTime="2363.559">
    Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. 
    I'm sorry to interrupt you so early, but what about Justice Ginsburg's point, which I understood to be there's always delay resulting from these pretrial motions; it's just that the district judge takes that into account, says, well, I'm going to have a lot of the usual pretrial motions, so I'm going to set the trial date at this point. 
    So that is delay, when the trial date might otherwise have been set, resulting from these pretrial motions, and then the -- the statute goes on to tell you how you count that delay.
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2363.559" stopTime="2397.482">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    --That's exactly our argument, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    Our argument is there's two ways you can have delay: One is by the trial date simply being moved to accommodate the motion. 
    The other -- and this is where we agree with what the Solicitor General said here today, as well as at page 38-39 of his opening brief -- delay can also, in the ordinary English language, mean that the trial date was originally set to accommodate the motions in the way you just described. 
    But what the Solicitor General is arguing for is something much more dramatic than that. 
    They are arguing for an exclusion of the time, even if trial date was set irregardless of the motions--
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2397.482" stopTime="2423.013">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    How would you ever know that? 
    How would we ever know that, Mr. Fisher? 
    A trial judge that has had a lot of criminal cases knows that there's going to be some motions as you get closer to trial, but how would we know whether the judge -- this particular judge took into account the likelihood of motions in setting the trial date or didn't?
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2423.013" stopTime="2451.566">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    --Well, ordinarily, Justice Ginsburg -- remember, this is only a small subset of cases. 
    But in those cases, ordinarily, I would think the trial judge would say on the record when the date is set. 
    Now, if it's -- if there's motion practice before there's any date that's ever set, the NACDL brief, I think, explains how that works in the district in the Sixth Circuit right now. 
    Parties often stipulate or are asked to stipulate by the court. 
    Common sense goes a long way in this scenario, Justice Ginsburg. 
    It's obvious.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="2451.566" stopTime="2452.532">

    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    Defendants don't always benefit from the clock running, Justice Ginsburg. 
    I think there's two reasons why they might stipulate. 
    One is because it might simply be obvious that the motion is of sufficient weight and difficulty that it's going to consume the court's resources, so why argue something that wouldn't have a basis to begin with? 
    But I think the NACDL brief is forthright in saying, at least at the beginning of criminal cases, often defendants find themselves wanting more time, and so, again, they don't have the incentive to argue against that.
speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="2485.469" stopTime="2514.988">
    Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr. 
    How do you reconcile your argument with the situation in which the motion is pending for 30 days, so that's the period from the filing until the prompt disposition, and as a result of that motion, the trial judge says this has caused -- this is going to force me, this is going to result in 10 days' delay in the date on which the case can begin, so the trial date is pushed back 10 days? 
    Now, in that situation, how much time is excluded?
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2514.988" stopTime="2595.023">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    I think the -- the text of the statute allows you to say either 30 or 10. 
    I think in light of this Court's Henderson decision -- and perhaps I think Congress had administrability concerns in mind with that last clause -- I think 30 days could be excluded. 
    But if you disagree with me on that and you want to have a rigid textual reading of the statute resulting from only meaning 10 days, I think that's your only other option. 
    Because, if I could ask the Court, or at least direct the Court to page 6 of the Solicitor General's reply brief, this is where they give -- because I think what the government wants to do is pose these difficult hypotheticals, and the sort of difficult question you just raised, Justice Alito, and have this Court respond by saying, oh, we're just going to throw the words "delay resulting from" out of the statute. 
    Because there's only two definitions, two ways to deal with what the Solicitor General offers. 
    First, they say that delay means time, and I think ordinary -- in ordinary English language, "delay" means something more than time. 
    It means postponement. 
    So then the fallback argument -- this is the second paragraph on page 6 -- is that the occurrence that is postponed is the STA's deadline for commencing trial, and our suggestion is that that begs the whole question. 
    That can't possibly be right, because the whole reason that you're looking to subsection (d) to apply it is to ask whether you should exclude the time.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="2595.023" stopTime="2648.658">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Excuse me, but isn't that what the statute says? 
    Meaning, if you look at (h), the beginning paragraph at (h), it says, 
    "The following periods of delay shall be excluded in computing the time within which the trial of any such offense must commence. " 
    It's not talking about the delay of the trial. 
    It's talking about the computation of the start date for the trial. 
    So if that's what that commands you to do, doesn't -- isn't only the Solicitor General's position consistent with that? 
    It's telling you to take the periods of delay and compute the date the trial must start by excluding those. 
    That's the language.
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2648.658" stopTime="2667.752">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    I think for two reasons, I would disagree, respectfully, Justice Sotomayor. 
    First is, I take that language to say that we're going to now tell you all the circumstances under which you exclude time, and so if any of these subsections are satisfied, you exclude the time. 
    But the--
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="2667.752" stopTime="2668.285">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    That's the--
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2668.285" stopTime="2676.225">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    --Solicitor General's argument is that you start from the premise. 
    "Delay resulting from" means you've already excluded the time. 
    That's the premise.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="2676.225" stopTime="2686.366">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    --Well, but that's what (h) says; (h) says you compute the start date of the trial, when it must start, by excluding all of these periods of delay. 
    It's defining it for you.
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2686.366" stopTime="2761.331">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    Well, if -- if there was delay. 
    Maybe another example, Justice Sotomayor. 
    In subsection 7, which is at (4)(a) of the government's appendix, I think is another way of showing that it can't possibly -- even if it weren't begging the question, it can't possibly be right. 
    It has to be talking about the trial itself, because this is the continuance -- the end of the justice continuance section. 
    And it says, 
    "Any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by a judge on his own motion. " 
    and blah, blah, blah, "if certain criteria are met". 
    Now, it's very clear that in that section, "period" -- "period of delay resulting from" can't mean that we've already said that the clock is stopped, because there's an "if" clause that gives you certain things that have to be satisfied in order to exclude it. 
    So I think starting with the very title of the Act we're talking about, the Speedy Trial Act, and the -- the idea of the words "delay resulting from" can only sensibly mean delay resulting from trial. 
    And so I think the definition that we've given you again, which is, delay results from a trial if the trial itself is postponed, or if the trial is set in a way that accommodates the motion, is the only way to give meaning to the operative words in the statute.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="2761.331" stopTime="2791.350">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    So it doesn't matter how substantial and important a motion is, whether it was your motion to dismiss for Speedy Trial Act reasons or the administrative motions here that you say really didn't require time? 
    It doesn't matter; all that matters is keeping track from day one, the commencement of the trial, as to when the Court is about to set the trial date, that it does it at the end of all the motions. 
    That's the only time the court can do it.
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2791.350" stopTime="2800.956">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    The distinction between administrative and nonadministrative motions, I think, doesn't matter in this case because trial wasn't--

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Why wouldn't it matter?
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2801.658" stopTime="2834.943">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    --Well, it would matter, I think, Justice Sotomayor, in a circumstance where the trial date hadn't been set yet and then was set, and an argument might arise -- well, I think we've had this dialogue already to some degree. 
    I didn't -- I expected these kinds of motions to be filed. 
    I knew there was going to be a suppression hearing. 
    We had the whole -- therefore, I set the trial out. 
    That would seem to be saying this was a nonadministrative matter that I had to accommodate. 
    I don't think a trial judge -- put another way, I don't think a trial judge could say I'm setting trial date outside the 70-day deadline because I had to sign my name to that pro haec vice motion.
speaker="sonia_sotomayor" startTime="2834.943" stopTime="2855.090">
    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Well, actually it happens all the time. 
    In the "rocket docket" in Virginia, the court sets a trial date, and you file whatever motions you're going to file. 
    Under your theory, until that last motion actually delays the trial date, none of those motions exclude time.
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2855.090" stopTime="2863.695">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    That may well be correct, but I don't know why it would matter, because it doesn't matter until you get outside of the 70 days to begin with. 
    So--
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="2863.695" stopTime="2904.856">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    It matters because the trial judges have to know what to do, and while your reading might fit the language in ordinary English better, I think it does. 
    It's also possible to read those words "delay resulting from" as simply referring to a period of time; and the statute is saying these periods of time are excluded from accounting. 
    Now, the virtue of that is just what Justice Ginsburg started with; all the trial judges know how to do it; the lawyers don't get mixed up; and the problem with what you're arguing for, in my mind -- if you want to say anything more about it, do -- is that it seems very unworkable to strike trying to figure out what causes what.
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="2904.856" stopTime="3037.823">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    --Let me say a couple things, Justice Breyer. 
    First, with all due respect, I have to disagree with your premise that it's possible to read the statute the way the Solicitor General wants to read it. 
    Now I'll accept for purposes of responding to your question, let's imagine that it were possible to read it that way. 
    I think our rule is not as difficult to administer as you think it might be in the -- NACDL brief LDY. 
    And indeed the Solicitor General -- this has been the -- this has been the law in -- in the Sixth Circuit for 17 months. 
    They haven't pointed to a single dismissal as a result of it. 
    Now let me take the other side, and this brings us to the dialogue during Mr. Roberts' argument; the Solicitor General's rule isn't so easy, either, unless you simply cease caring at all about the Act. 
    You could have a perfectly administrable rule that says every singly motion, no matter what the circumstances, tolls the clock. 
    But that's not the law in the First Circuit, for example. 
    They're made clear as Justice Sotomayor said that if a motion is filed to frustrate the speedy trial clock, then we're not going to exclude it; and that makes perfect sense. 
    I mean, look at this case. 
    And I'm not going to suggest there was any ill will or bad faith in this case; but the facts of the case illustrate the problem. 
    On August 1st, trial date was set for August 14th. 
    There were 14 days before the trial was going to happen. 
    Yet there were only -- even under the best reading there were only 10 days left on the clock. 
    So if no motions had been filed, unquestionably we would have a Speedy Trial Act violation. 
    So the government's whole case hinges on the fact that because it filed this purely administrative motion to bring a gun into the courtroom, a motion I might add that at the pretrial conference the judge had already told the government was going to be granted, and so I don't know why it couldn't have been made at the moment the evidence was introduced; and one other administration motion, then the Speedy Trial Act isn't violated. 
    And to borrow the Solicitor General's own phrase from page 38 of his brief, that outcome bears no relation to the Act's purpose. 
    So what you have to do to have, I think, the government's argument be at all faithful, even if it were possible under the language -- have it be at all faithful with the purpose of the Act, is to have some kind of exception for motions that frustrate, motions that are pretextual, motions that are purely administrative, however it would be defined.

    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    --I -- well, two things, Justice Ginsburg. 
    First of all, we're not relying in this Court on the Speedy Trial Act motion to get us to the Speedy Trial Act violation. 
    The two motions the government filed get you to the 70 days, and so we haven't made an argument with respect to the Speedy Trial Act. 
    But if we had to, the argument would be -- with regard to that motion, would be that it didn't delay trial. 
    Trial had already been set, the Court said this is when we're going to trial; trial wasn't moved, and we all went to trial. 
    And so--

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor

    Justice Sonia Sotomayor 
    Why should we care whether it's an administrative motion or simply to clarify the functioning of the trial? 
    Why should we not exclude those times, because those -- those motions, whether they're administrative or not, will cause the trial to go faster, because issues that would otherwise consume the time of the court during trial are being resolved before trial.
speaker="jeffrey_l_fisher" startTime="3125.310" stopTime="3171.391">
    Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher 
    I think that might be an argument for writing the Speedy Trial Act a different way, Justice Sotomayor; but if the question is whether the motion delayed trial -- and that's the question that the Speedy Trial Act requires the judge to ask and answer -- then the administrative piece of paper going across the judge's desk when the judge knows ahead of time it isn't going to cause any difficult, simply doesn't delay trial. 
    At page, I believe it's 5 or 6 of the NACDL brief, they talk about pretrial conferences. 
    And they say what happens in the Sixth Circuit right now is the judge holds the conference; as you say, counsel wakes up; and everybody -- and the judge says tell me the motions you're going to file. 
    And the counsel from both sides tell the judge what motions are going to be filed, and they discuss right then and there whether they're going to delay -- whether they're going to cause some delay for trial. 
    And so--

    You read that, I think, to mean delay resulting from any pretrial moment and not to exceed -- right -- the period from the filing of the filing of the motion to the conclusion of the hearing.

    I think it's a tough word to know exactly what transition is taking place there, but in this Court's Bloate decision, last term, I think -- what I'm -- the argument I'm making is perfectly consistent with that decision, where it said the "from clause" is sort of the boundaries on when subsection D applies. 
    If you're talking about delay that a motion caused either after the hearing or before the filing, we don't want to hear from you. 
    But the from clause tells you if the delay falls within those two goalposts, then it's excludable.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3240.100" stopTime="3242.568">

    I don't think it's a perfect way to say it, either, Justice Scalia. 
    And I said -- in my dialogue with Justice Alito, I think that you could also say, especially with a little bit of pushing on Henderson, that "resulting from" actually gives you a specific time period in between those that you have to exclude. 
    But I think that that's the best reading of the Act, and again, it's the only one that gives -- that gives meaning to the phrase delay resulting from. 
    If I might just say one or two words to circle back to where I began, Mr. Tinklenberg urges you to affirm the Sixth Circuit decision or to dismiss this case as improvidently granted; but what he urges you not to do and thinks there's no basis in precedent for doing, which is to reverse the lower court without reading the alternative arguments; and with all due respect, the 10-day argument that we preserved in our bio and we fully made in our bottom side brief in this case, I think is extraordinarily strong, and it's difficult to get around in this case for all the reasons I've explained. 
    So with that, I'll -- I'll answer any other questions this Court has about that argument, because I think it's very important.

   Rebuttal of Matthew D. Roberts
speaker="matthew_d_roberts" startTime="3313.714" stopTime="3501.821">
    Mr. Matthew D. Roberts 
    Thank you, Your Honor. 
    First I would like to stress that the government thinks that it's very important that the Court address the question that we raised in our cert petition, and that the Court granted certiorari to answer, on which there's a split in the circuits and which we believe that if it's left standing will result in serious disruption to the Speedy Trial Act. 
    Turning to -- to that question, a few points first. 
    Respondent's definition of delay is plainly inconsistent with Henderson which already holds that the period of delay that's excludable is the time between the filing of the motion and the disposition of the motion. 
    That can't be squared with the notion that delay is the period during which trial is postponed. 
    Second, Respondent's definition of delay gives delay a different meaning in the first part of the statute and in subsection D, where this Court's already held that it has the meaning that we suggest. 
    Third, Respondent's test is totally unworkable, because you can't tell at the time a motion is filed how much time it's going to take to resolve and whether trial is going to be postponed. 
    District Court judges have over 500 pending cases on their docket, an average District Court judge. 
    A hundred of them are criminal. 
    The court -- the Speedy Trial Act cannot function if the judges are going to have to make a complex judicial determination in each case to determine whether each motion is excludable. 
    Respondent says that NACDL says defendants won't object or that they'll stipulate to the exclusion of time, but NACDL also says that defendants may change their mind if the case goes to trial, and if they change their mind and file a motion to dismiss under the Speedy Trial Act, their prior failures to object and stipulations may very well not be binding because this Court held in Zedner that defendants can prospectively waive the application of the Act. 
    And Respondent's tests would also throw the established way that the Speedy Trial Act has been operating for over 30 years into disarray. 
    Turning to whether this Court has to address the alternative arguments for affirmance, Nobles plainly says that the Court has discretion not to address those issues if those issues are not independently worthy of certiorari. 
    It doesn't base that on the fact that the -- on the fact that the argument would expand the judgment below, and the rule that it's discretionary makes sense, because the contrary rule would require the court to address numerous issues that are not important and -- in every case where they're raised, and would also lead the court to either dismiss writs as improvidently granted or to address only as dicta important issues on which the Court has granted certiorari. 
    Finally--
