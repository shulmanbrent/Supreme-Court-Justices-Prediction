    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court. 
    This case is before the Court as a controversy between Texas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Florida over certain intangible obligations which were incurred in the course of business of Sun Oil Company, which of course is a state which is involved in operations throughout all the states or rather, they have permit to do business in all the states and do business in many of them. 
    The particular obligations which we are concerned with in this case arose out of the operations of two district offices located in Texas and --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    To what?
speaker="w_o_shultz_ii" startTime="111.062" stopTime="895.863">
    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    District or division offices. 
    Their home office is in Philadelphia but they maintain throughout the United States certain division offices and the record, according to the stipulation, shows that the two offices in Texas were more or less, autonomous in the scope of their operations there in Texas. 
    They conducted placing agreements, drilling. 
    They operated for oil and gas in Texas as well as neighboring states. 
    They contracted for their own labor hiring and firing, and handled their own payroll, and so on. 
    New Jersey is claiming that, as a domiciliary state of the corporation, that it is entitled to take all of these obligations. 
    Florida contends that, as the state of the last known address, contend for a theory that the last known address should govern as to which state has the power to take possession of these unclaimed obligations. 
    We, as an alternative to the position which was adopted by the special master which concluded that all of these obligations had a status with the creditor, therefore, only the state wherein the last known address, they had the power to deal with these obligations, well, it seemed to us, in taking this approach, that you ignore many of the equities concerning the transaction out of which these obligations arose. 
    And, that you take a rather arbitrary single factor surrounding a particular obligation when you know other circumstances surrounding the same obligation which might enact with the injustice, in fairness to everyone, give some other state a better claim to these intangibles under their state actions. 
    We, in addition, feel very strongly about the fact that such a roué would allow the accretion, so to speak, of the oil in -- proceeds from oil and gas of the State of Texas and allow them to be trickled out a piece of meal to other states when, under the law of Texas, oil and gas in place is a real estate and, also, that the rights to delay rentals have been considered as a real property right in Texas. 
    Now, we admit that, under Texas law, once these minerals have been produced and once the delay rentals are due that they're considered to be personal realty. 
    But, there are cases which recognize, and I think it's an established principle in the law, that even though you may have personal realty that it may be so connected with the real estate or real property interest that it may be considered immovable by the state within which the property from which is located was derived. 
    And, we have approached the problem as to oil and gas proceeds and the delay rentals in Texas from that stand point. 
    We cited in our brief, in that respect, the Toledo Society for Crippled Children versus Hickok which does not directly reach that point but, to me, it gives an indication that the Texas Courts would be and are very reluctant to allow the laws of another state to determine title to anything which is very closely related to the realty in Texas. 
    Now, in that case, there was oil and gas property involved, and the testator residing in Ohio, at his death, by his will, set up trust for his property, the residual part of his property, whereby part of it would go to -- the proceeds from it would go income to his wife and children for 20 years and, thereafter, that the corpus would be divided up among certain charitable organizations. 
    Under Ohio law, such a bequest was invalid and it was so held by the Ohio Supreme Court. 
    Well, the Society came down to Texas and filed a suit in Texas to declare their interest in the real property in Texas valid under that will. 
    If we look a little at the operations of Mr. Hickok, he was in partnership with a Texas oil operator here and they had agreed, shortly before his death, that they would transfer all of their partnership assets which consisted of certain Oil and Gas properties to a corporation and, in turn, receive stock in this corporations for the assets which they transferred the real property they transferred. 
    The corporation has been formed at the death of Mr. Hickok, but the actual transfer had not been carried out and his will specifically directed that his executors and administrators go ahead and carry out that provision, which they did. 
    And, actually, the case went off on the theory of whether or not equitable conversion applied in a situation such as this where you have a conflict of laws question determining the validity of title to real estate or the proceeds from real estate. 
    The Texas Court held that even though this realty had been directed by the will to be converted into personal realty that, in determining which law, whether Ohio or Texas, applied to determine whether these charitable organizations were to receive the benefits of the trust that the testator intended, the Court held that -- the Texas Supreme Court held that the Doctrine of Equitable Conversion had no place in the rules pertaining to conflicts of law in saying which law of which state applied. 
    And, they applied the law of Texas and upheld the validity of this bequest in the will. 
    In the course of that opinion, the Court stated that the interest in question were personal realty for distribution purposes. 
    They were yet immovable for purposes of determining whether the laws of England or Hungry applied. 
    They were talking about a case that they were discussing in there which also determined a question of -- conflict of law question over which law would apply either England where a land had been converted into personal realty and bequeath to some Hungarian persons, or whether the law of Hungary would apply. 
    We'd like to take the position that the proceeds of these estates in Texas are so closely connected with the estate. 
    As a matter of fact, they are the full enjoinment of these estates. 
    An interest in oil and gas, in place, has no value other than the probability or possibility that it will produce and bring income and then becomes valuable, and the enjoinment accrues to the owner when, in fact, there is that deduction. 
    It is a piece meal sale, so to speak, or a continuing sale of the real property interest. 
    And, we take the position that injustice and inequity and a controversy between states to see whose law shall apply to take possession of these proceeds from this deduction when it has been abandoned or, so to speak, unclaimed by the rightful owner for a period of time should be determined under Texas law because these things are too closely related to the title to Texas land to be determined by the law of another state because it's well recognized that the law of no other state can determine the title to the realty itself. 
    And, for that reason, we urge the Court to declare that the Texas law should apply to all proceeds from the oil and gas production and the delay rentals, even though accrued and even though they are, under Texas law, personal realty. 
    But, that they are personal realty of such a nature and so-related to the realty that they have, if you please, presence in the State of Texas only for purposes of determining title. 
    The same question was touched upon in Commissioner versus Skaggs in which Mr. Skaggs, being a resident of Texas, he and his wife own real property in California and a question arose over whether the income from this real property in California would be immunity or separate, whether they could return a joint return or whether he had violated his separate property. 
    Well, the Court, in that case, even though the marital residence was in Texas, looked to the law of California which characterized those rentals as his separate property and they discussed the problem and (Inaudible) into crops that grow on the land and admit that even thought once the crops are severed they are personal realty but, even so, the title to them should be determined by the law of the state where the land is located rather than to allow the Texas law to characterize them as something else. 
    In this sense, statutes of that nature operate as statutes real not in the sense they are operating on real property but that they are operating on the thing itself rather than the person. 
    And in fact of the presence of the thing itself give this importance. 
    In addition to this phase of our argument in the case, we look upon all of these obligations, of course they are intangible obligations, and the Courts -- various Courts through the years have held that intangibles have a status here and they have a status there for various purposes and, for taxation purposes, generally at the residence of the person to whom they are owned, the creditor. 
    But, I don't think that this is an inflexible determination that the courts made. 
    Considering all the facts, the facts that the land -- there, you know the man actually is living in a certain state and he is there carrying on business operations, and this is part of his capital with which he works. 
    And, that state gives him the protection of its laws in the operation of his business. 
    So, I don't think the sole consideration in those cases, even though they say that the status is with his residence, I think they take in the other factors into consideration in reaching this conclusion, and this --
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="895.863" stopTime="913.267">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Shouldn't our Solicitor generally be before the true owner of this property, the creditor, and not the debtor state or debtor company in the state?
speaker="w_o_shultz_ii" startTime="913.267" stopTime="918.235">
    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    I think that the interest of the creditor should always be primary and I think --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I'm just wondering if it wouldn't be more likely to be served then if we did follow the Master in saying that the last known address of the creditor is one who should determine the state in which this escheat could be had because in each one of the states there must be a procedure. 
    It might not be more likely to know if the escheat procedure in the state of his last known address than in some other state that might not come in and here is the heirs come in and claim the property rather than to have this escheat to the state or to -- to the state, yes.

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Well, again, when you talk about contacts, it's your Solicitor for the state, rather than with the creditor.
speaker="w_o_shultz_ii" startTime="975.658" stopTime="990.898">
    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    Well, as between -- this is a controversy between the states and, as between the states, I think the Solicitor should be to the state with the most significant context with the transaction out of which it arose.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="990.898" stopTime="1018.970">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    But wouldn't -- well, I'm just inquiring. 
    I made up my own mind but I'm just wondering if the vital contact shouldn't be the one where a man's last residence is because when it comes to escheating of a property of a state he might have a better opportunity there where he's more likely to be than in the state from which he moved or never was.
speaker="w_o_shultz_ii" startTime="1018.970" stopTime="1141.126">
    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    Well, I think that is that the fact of his last known address is one of the factors to be considered and weighed with all others, but I don't think it should outweigh all of it because in the mobility of our population today, and it's becoming more mobile every day, persons are within one state for today and they're across the continent the next day and they have moved there because of a better job opportunity. 
    We have become a very mobile civilization and this is completely outside of the record and the briefs and our experience in Texas. 
    People have claimed a property which we have taken under our law and they come from even though their last address may have been in Texas. 
    We get their claim forms from all over California, Florida and in most of those instances, presumably, it's people who had gone there to retire or something. 
    And yet, here, they come back and they ask us for their money and they are not anywhere near their last known address. 
    Now, if the last known address is the only thing you know about the transaction then, certainly, that should bear a prime consideration. 
    But, where you know these other factors, for instance, back to our Texas situation again, I'll make this as an alternative argument to our prior argument, that, there, all of the transactions concerning production in Texas of oil and gas certainly took place in Texas. 
    These local offices went out and negotiated the leases. 
    They directed the drilling, the production, the distribution of the proceeds, by way of the orders which were signed, among the owners, splitting up the proceeds. 
    The drilling took place there. 
    It's a daily production from the real estate there in Texas.

    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    It is, to the extent -- to a certain extent, but I think the only controversy here is between these four states. 
    Now, if some other state in which this person's last known address was, even though he was hired by the Texas local offices and worked in Louisiana state and he was directed out of the Texas offices, still, in the absence of some claim by Louisiana as between these states, before the Court today, Texas should be entitled to take custody of that. 
    Now, if Louisiana later wants to assert a claim, there's nothing under this Court's previous language in Standard Oil case and which was quoted in Western Union case which said what some other state may claim from New Jersey may be -- is not before us and -- we don't foreclose their coming before this Court to make that determination.

    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    Thank you, sir. 
    Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court. 
    I might direct myself back to Mr. Justice Goldberg's question concerning the wages which may have been earned in various others states outside of Texas but under the direction and through contract through the Sun Oil Company division offices. 
    Now, as I was saying that it seems to me that the context of the State of Texas would be significant with such transaction, much more so than the domiciliary state of the corporation or even the last known address of such an employee. 
    Also, in that line, I might ask the question, parenthetically, of where would this person look for his wages if he indeed suddenly woke up and decided “well, I didn't collect all my wages when I worked for the Beaumont office of Sun Oil Company” and if he was living at that time in Louisiana, he certainly wouldn't go back to his last address in Louisiana. 
    He'd look then he'd contact Sun Oil Company in Texas and the wages would be with the treasurer's office there in the State of Texas being unclaimed. 
    And, this same consideration certainly holds true as to the mineral proceeds and production of oil and gas. 
    Now, a person living in any of the other states, it makes no difference which one, he is not going to look to his last known address when he suddenly realizes “well, way back there, I saw an advertisement for a small realty interest in the paper in Texas and I sent my $10 in and I wonder whatever happened to that.”
speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="1362.846" stopTime="1371.744">
    Justice Arthur J. Goldberg 
    It seems to me it does apply to a person residing there or a he has to be a California person?
speaker="w_o_shultz_ii" startTime="1371.744" stopTime="1451.108">
    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    As between these states here, I would say so. 
    But, now, as to what some other state may have as a claim to it or basis of a claim that has to come up when that state makes a claim to it. 
    And, there's nothing to preclude such another state from coming to the state that takes under this decision and saying before this Court again “we have a better claim to it than the state that took it.” 
    It's a problem to me that, in the absence of a compact between the states are completely uniform statute enacted by all the states which uses as a basis the last known address, that you can't solve on the last known address basis and, that is, having a built-in reciprocity clause in these statutes too, whereby if one state takes and, later or at the same time, the state of last known address where you know this last known address state and they have a lack of statute with a reciprocity clause and then, of course, one state will refer to the one with the last known address.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="1451.108" stopTime="1464.624">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Which would be more likely to produce the most litigation, the last known address or the more context?
speaker="w_o_shultz_ii" startTime="1464.624" stopTime="1543.006">
    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    Well, that would be hard for me to say. 
    Probably, under the contact theory, you might, unless -- in some instances, it seems to me that the context would be so significant that there wouldn't be any questions about it, and you will always have those closer questions in any of that. 
    But, the fact that the person is no longer at his last known address, to me, speaks against the justice and equity of such a roué when you, in fact, know some other concrete facts about the transactions, where it took place and what occurred. 
    Now, there's also the problem that supposedly is up in the area from my view point of the Master's report of those instances where there is no last known address. 
    Now, the Master said that New Jersey, having a custodial law, could of course take these. 
    Well, Texas law is custodial in effect and, from my reading of the Florida statute, it is, too, and so is Pennsylvania.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1543.006" stopTime="1547.734">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Do you distinguish custodial from escheat in that?
speaker="w_o_shultz_ii" startTime="1547.734" stopTime="1553.555">
    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    Do I? 
    No, I really think it makes no difference.

    (Inaudible)
speaker="w_o_shultz_ii" startTime="1573.972" stopTime="1694.147">
    Mr. W. O. Shultz II 
    Well, one theory is that the -- I mean, the difference in the two, of course, being that the custodial keeps the money for the person to come claim it and the other takes it away from him. 
    It just depends upon the benevolent attitude of the state legislature when they enact such statute, but there's no question, it seems to me, in this case of jurisdictional requirements for either type of statute. 
    At the Middle East, Sun Oil Company is subject to the jurisdiction law, the states have before the Court and the pronouncements of this Court here before and other Courts proceed upon the theory that an intangible, if you can get personal jurisdiction of a debtor, then you've got jurisdiction -- and cite the creditor by publication or some other method of reasonable notice, then you've got jurisdiction to deal with that debt or obligation. 
    And, we've got just that situation here. 
    But, I just fail to see the fairness in the last known address solely as a basis. 
    As I say, where it's the only thing you know, perhaps that should be the governing basis, but then we're up in the air about the unknown address situations. 
    What do you do then? 
    Then, do you revert to the points of contact theory for those transactions? 
    It seems to me that would lead to a more diverse series of situations than would the points of contact theory. 
    And, for those reasons, I fail to see the justification of the Master statement that the State of New Jersey, simply because it had a custodial statute, could take the unknown proceeds.

    I don't believe there is a simple solution. 
    As I said, the most equitable and fair solution to me would be for all the states to get together and enter into a compact arrangement or adopt uniform statutes which -- with reciprocity clause and work it out in that way.

    We are at a quandary there under the Master's report, it seems to me. 
    Now, I think that the solution that we have presented is an equitable and fair solution. 
    It tries to weigh all the considerations and gives the Court a chance to weigh considerations and arrive at a just and equitable results which, it's my understanding, is what we're supposed to try to do under our jurisprudence.

   Argument of Charles J. Kehoe
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2127.820" stopTime="2134.848">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Thank you, Mr. Shultz. 
    Mr. Kehoe.
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="2134.848" stopTime="2477.720">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court. 
    In this action, this Court is being called upon for the first time to decide what rule of law should be adopted where there is a conflict between states who seek to take intangibles which have been unclaimed from a corporation incorporated in one state and doing business in many other states. 
    New Jersey commenced an action against the Sun Oil Company in September of 1961 under the New Jersey Custodial Escheat Law and, while that action was pending, in November, Texas enacted an escheat statute and then commenced an action in this Court to restrain the taking by New Jersey of the intangibles from the Sun. 
    This brought before the Court the question of which state should take so that the holder of the intangibles will properly be protected in his constitutional rights. 
    The history of the activity of the states in this field commenced, so far as litigation is concerned, to some degree back in 1923 with the Security Savings Bank versus California where the right of the State of California to take unclaimed bank deposits was sustained. 
    And then, we went on into Connecticut Mutual Life versus Moore where unclaimed life insurance funds were held to be taken -- to be subject to custodial taking by the State of New York where the policies had been delivered in New York on the lives of residents of New York. 
    And then, we went on to the Standard Oil case where it was held that the state of incorporation could escheat the shares of stock and the dividends payable there under. 
    In all of these cases, the question before the Court was the power of the state to take from the holder. 
    The state reserved the question expressly in at least two of the cases where a claim would be made by another state, and then we had Western Union versus Pennsylvania, which was decided by this Court in 1961, where Pennsylvania sought to escheat unclaimed intangibles held by Western Union, a New York corporation doing business in the State of Pennsylvania. 
    And, there, the Court held that the State of Pennsylvania could not take unless it could protect the holder from double liability, and we look at this case as that is the question before the Court. 
    How can this Court best protect a holder from double liability? 
    The Master, in his report, suggested a standard of last known address with a right to the state of incorporation to take under a custodial statute where there were not any last known addresses. 
    In the hearing before the Master, New Jersey urged that the Master adopt a standard of state of corporate domicile. 
    Now, the reason we urged that was because, in this area which New Jersey has had considerable experience, we find that when you commence an action against the corporation they are compelled to go into their rather ancient records and the facts which might be available to help on a context theory were not readily available. 
    For example, in this case, some of the claims are 40 years old. 
    Some of the claims in value vary from one penny to several hundred dollars. 
    The only facts which we could prepare for presentation to the Master were a stipulation of very general facts. 
    We stipulated that there were claims payable by the corporation. 
    We stipulated that the Southwest division in Texas does have some autonomy in its activities. 
    Of course, we couldn't stipulate that any one of those particular claims resulted from a man who was hired in Texas on such and such a day who worked in Louisiana on such and such a day because those facts are not available. 
    And, that is interesting only because it shows the general picture which a state is confronted with or a holder is confronted with or a Court is confronted with in passing on a question of this nature. 
    And if you adopt a standard of state of incorporation for taking from the holder, I think that would be the simplest and the most certain and the easiest rule for both the corporation of the states. 
    We concede that there may be situations where equity would require that a claim should go to a state other than the state of incorporation. 
    Well, if that is so, the state making such a claim would have to press its claim against the state of incorporation and, if they present a case -- a factual case which comes within the standard which would permit a second state to take from the state of incorporation, then the state of incorporation would have to pay them. 
    But, at least so far as the holder was concerned, he would be protected from being sued by any other state and we feel that a precedent has been established for this holding in the Standard Oil case.

speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="2566.650" stopTime="2690.007">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    Well, that was the -- what the Master reported. 
    We never had that in the trial of the case and I disagree with that because while there's $15 Billion available, incidentally the source of that is an article in the Wall Street Journal and how the man in the Wall Street Journal got his news, he calls up to various states because he called me up and, he -- from that, he writes this article. 
    And, of course, he's got a lot of news value when he says 15 Billion and $1 Billion a year, but I can tell you that, from our experience, the tenor of a trend is downward and not upward. 
    And, you will see, once the problems that now exist in this field are resolved, there's going to be a considerable decrease in the amount of unclaimed funds. 
    And, I question seriously whether we're dealing with $15 Billion. 
    I don't think we are. 
    As a matter of fact, the Master, in his report, I think he was persuaded very much by that factor because he said it would be inequitable for certain states that incorporate to take this huge sum of money and, certainly, it would be inequitable when you're dealing with what you're dealing with in this case. 
    You start off at $30,000 with wages of about $26,000. 
    We've got 1,700 claims. 
    I mean you've got a claim for 5 cents, what are you going to do? 
    See where this fellow bought the material. 
    Maybe he bought a lead pencil some place. 
    Where did he buy it, Louisiana or Texas? 
    I mean, you get to a point where you've got to, we think, adopt some rule which, at least initially, will set a standard for taking from the holder. 
    Now, if you want to go beyond that and you want to say that if a man was hired in Texas and he earned his wages in Texas and he was last heard of in Texas, and Texas should get that money, well, then it would seem, after it's taken from the holder, Texas would present its claim. 
    And, of course, if that standard was once set, we would pay or the state of incorporation, whichever –- it's just that we only argue for the state of incorporation because of the fact that it's a simple rule today and New Jersey may benefit in dollars and cents, but the --

    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    It depends on the statute. 
    In New Jersey, what we do, we take custody of a claim if it's unclaimed for five successive years. 
    Then we hold it for -- we take custody of it then we send them a notice by mail to the last known address and, also, to the Attorney General of the state if the address is outside New Jersey. 
    And then, after that notice is sent, we wait for a period of two years to give them an opportunity to claim. 
    And, after that two-year-period, we then proceed to escheat the funds which the state treasurer still holds.

    If it's unknown -- if the state mark is unknown.

    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    We can't do anything, Mr. Justice Clark.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="2997.386" stopTime="2999.051">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    You don't try to -- you don't try to send it to the District Attorney?
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="2999.051" stopTime="3043.851">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    No, we don't. 
    We do send a notice to the state -- to the Attorney General of the state if the address is outside the state, for example, these claims in Texas. 
    If New Jersey comes there to take custody, we will send a complete list to the Attorney General of the State of Texas when we mail a notice to those people whose last known address is in Texas. 
    Now, if he wants to, and we have some Attorney Generals that do, the Attorney General of Ohio for example, he does it as a public relations angle. 
    He tries to appeal --rallies people up. 
    If he rallies them up and he comes in with them, we pay them. 
    We're happy to pay them. 
    So, under the statutory program procedure in New Jersey, we do make a reasonable effort to locate these people. 
    It's not simply a question of a state of incorporation taking the money and holding on to it.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3043.851" stopTime="3049.935">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    But maybe every other state is -- maybe the state of the last known address might go through the equal procedure or even a better one.
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="3049.935" stopTime="3092.931">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    They might very well, but we say the state of last known address, it's got no substance like the state of incorporation. 
    We know the state where he's incorporated. 
    We know that he's there. 
    The state of last known address, I think, you can presume he severed his connection at least with the address and maybe with the state. 
    I mean, it's just not a supporting standard in this type of claim, you may get into another type of claim which last known address maybe a satisfactory standard. 
    Now, the reason that I say that and I'm trying to admit to the Court that in New Jersey, with unclaimed life insurance funds, we use the last known address there.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3092.931" stopTime="3104.663">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, you -- that the least of the last known address got enough substance to it, that's the Attorney General of that state or (Inaudible)
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="3104.663" stopTime="3105.214">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    That's right.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3105.214" stopTime="3107.523">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    Well, he did that but he had the terms of the creditors.
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="3107.523" stopTime="3112.224">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    That's right. 
    What else are we going to do? 
    I mean this -- You get into a program like this --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3112.224" stopTime="3121.956">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I get -- I agree, but if there's some relevance to the statement of that state of the last known address, I think, might have substance.
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="3121.956" stopTime="3170.085">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    Well, it's got some substance. 
    I don't disagree with that, Justice White, but I think when you have to choose between the two, and especially keeping in mind that you want to protect the corporation from double liability, you would be better off, we think, despite the state of corpus domicile. 
    Of course another problem with the last known address, suppose the corporation isn't in the state. 
    Take public service. 
    New Jersey got a stockholder in Texas. 
    How is Texas ever going to get that unclaimed dividend from the public service of New Jersey? 
    They do business only in New Jersey. 
    Surely, the Texas law is not going to be applicable, I don't think, to the corporation exclusively within New Jersey. 
    So, you've got a situation there where you can't say that this is the stand -- we don't think that this the standard in this case which must be --
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="3170.085" stopTime="3180.431">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    I would assume though that if -- I would assume that if the Court decided to say that the last known address is to have it -- then the State of New Jersey would take the right.
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="3180.431" stopTime="3181.822">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    I don't even question on that.

    And if -- well, now, I just --
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="3183.314" stopTime="3200.181">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    I mean, would it be that if you -- that you -- if you, gentlemen, decide the last known address, it's the last known address. 
    We'd be satisfied to have a workable rule, but what we are trying to say is that we think there's more substance to the state of corporate domicile than there is to the last known address.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3200.181" stopTime="3205.195">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I thought you were saying that the corporation might not accept withholding the money?

    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    The last known a -- well, they probably wouldn't pay to the State of Texas, I would imagine.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3211.089" stopTime="3212.550">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Even Texas wouldn't pay.
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="3212.550" stopTime="3246.266">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    That's right, but I think maybe we might take event from the state of corporation because this problem only comes because -- before this Court because there's a conflict. 
    I mean absent the conflict, all the states were taking from the corporations with the contact that they might have had but, now, we've got the conflict and it was inevitable. 
    I remember, I argued a case before Justice Brennan in the New Jersey Supreme Court and he asked that question 11 years ago, 12 years ago. 
    What are we going to do with two states? 
    Enforcing, I said it would be an original action in the Supreme Courts. 
    I was at least right on that point.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3246.266" stopTime="3269.495">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You tell me in 11 years. 
    You tell me in short and that extends to so many things involved. 
    What is your reason for believing that it's fairer for the state corporate domicile to have this on than any other state?
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="3269.495" stopTime="3321.726">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    Well, when you get into why it's fairer, it's a very broad, broad question but we think it's fairer because it's easier for the corporation. 
    It's easier for the corporation. 
    The corporation can report to one state. 
    It's subjected only to a limited amount of activity and it's fairer because we feel that it's a rule under the New Jersey law which permits the State of New Jersey to notify these people if they can be found at the last known address that they had some money and if they don't have any money -- I mean, if they don't have any claim or they can't be found at that address then, of course, you eliminate the last known address state. 
    So, in a question of fairness, we think that that is as good a rule as any. 
    Now, of course when you get into fairer, the other states are going to say it's --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="3321.726" stopTime="3334.632">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Why is that the same argument -- fairer way for New Jersey to do or the others? 
    It could be left to the company to keep it since you're going to keep it from getting charged a trial and so forth.

speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="3357.345" stopTime="3388.726">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    As between the corporation and a state, any state, we think, has a paramount of right because, while it's holding it, it's using it for the benefit of the citizens. 
    In other words, they keep a fund. Most of these programs, they take 75% of the general treasury and 25% to repay claims. 
    So, they're using the money for the benefit of the citizens and that, historically, is the doctrine of Bona Vacantia where the ownerless property is used by the sovereign for the benefit of the citizens. 
    That's the theory.

    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    That's right and if you have a simple plan for tracing the owner, then you've got the answer but there is no simple plan.

    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    Florida contends for the theory that the state of the last known address should -- is the one that's entitled to these properties. 
    Now, whether we proceed on a theory of escheat or proceed on the theory of custodial laws, in either case, more than one state very likely will be laying plain to the identical properties. 
    In this case, the State of Texas, the State of Pennsylvania, the State of New Jersey are laying claim to the same properties and Florida is laying claim to the intangibles belonging to people whose last known address was in Florida.

    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    That's the extent of our claim. 
    It's the last known address.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    People known who lives in Florida you find in the record.

    People whose last known address was in Florida.

    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    On the books of the company. 
    But -- a primary evidence, I guess you have of the last known address would be on the books of the company. 
    Now, we think --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3865.043" stopTime="3871.922">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    What is the view of Florida as to people who didn't have any last known address?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="3871.922" stopTime="3872.283">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3872.283" stopTime="3873.021">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Just unknown.
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="3873.021" stopTime="3892.400">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    I am kindly inclined to the view that the better rule there might be to follow the presumption that the people who had no address on the books lived at the place where the obligation accrued.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3892.400" stopTime="3894.923">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    That is the domicile of the debtor?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="3894.923" stopTime="3953.344">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Domicile of the debtor or, if the record shows, that the contract was entered into in a particular state than in that state. 
    Now that would raise as a presumptive last known address, but I see a difficulty in trying to arrive at a definite rule after that because you've got no last known address anywhere, not even on the books of the company. 
    So, I think we might indulge in the presumption that the creditor lived in the neighborhood where the claim accrued. 
    Now, that seems to be the best instruction I could put on that.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3953.344" stopTime="3962.827">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Of course some of these claims, going back great many years, it may not -- there may not -- nobody may know where the claim accrued.
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="3962.827" stopTime="3974.783">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well, I don't know if anybody would probably know at the present time, but I believe we have a rule of law that a person's address is at one place, it's presumed to be there until some evidence is shown that it's been moved.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3974.783" stopTime="3982.584">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well, I'm still talking though not about cases where you have no address and where you don't know where the claim accrued because of the antiquity of the claim.
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="3982.584" stopTime="3990.007">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well, then I guess you're going to have to go back to New Jersey's claim of the --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3990.007" stopTime="3990.502">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Domicile of the debtor.
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="3990.502" stopTime="3992.288">

    Domicile of the owner.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3992.288" stopTime="3992.978">

    Yes.
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="3992.978" stopTime="4002.495">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Because I think it would be presumed that if you had no other evidence of a place where the claim accrued, it would be at the domicile of the person who --
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4002.495" stopTime="4003.240">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Owed the money.
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4003.240" stopTime="4004.329">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Yes.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="4004.329" stopTime="4016.995">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The Court, as I read the briefs, some of these claims are to interest that, under Texas law, are real estate.

    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    That --

    What do you say to that?

    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    I think --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Oil and gas interests?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4023.015" stopTime="4052.383">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    I think those gas interests, my view on that is, as long as the interest of the amount to be paid has not accrued, I think it is probably an interest in real estate. 
    But, when that money has accrued on the obligations, then I think it becomes then an intangible and not a part of the real estate.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4052.383" stopTime="4055.966">

    By Texas law?

    Well, I don't know about Texas law.

    When it's severed from its oil, free from the drill. 
    When the oil --

    Justice John M. Harlan 
    Is that a Texas rule or is that your rule or you want us to adopt that rule?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4070.651" stopTime="4083.177">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well, that would seem to me, we have a better rule on or you've got conflicts of laws between states and where this money becomes new.
speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="4083.177" stopTime="4093.757">
    Justice John M. Harlan 
    If it was an acre of ground, for example, that was involved in this in Texas, you would agree that it would escheat the Texas I suppose --
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4093.757" stopTime="4120.491">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    If -- If you've got a lease on an acre of ground in Texas, an oil lease, and oil is discovered on that lease, on that one acre of ground, then I think the oil interest or the interests are real estate until the oil and gas has been separated and taken from the ground.
speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="4120.491" stopTime="4122.372">
    Justice Byron R. White 
    And sold.

    Sir?

    And sold.
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4123.819" stopTime="4165.805">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    And sold, yes. 
    It's taken from the ground and sold, and then it becomes an obligation -- an intangible obligation. 
    But, it seems to me, well, that, that would be the better rule to follow in the matters of that kind because we've -- in most cases they, like oil and gas and coal and so forth, are considered as part of the real estate until severed. 
    So, I believe that that would be the better rule to follow as to those.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="4165.805" stopTime="4187.224">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I suppose the question of the escheat of realty that way would not arise very often, would it? 
    Because if it was realty, it would be taxable in the state and if the owner didn't pay the tax, they'd sell it for Texas to -- the state will sell it for Texas, would it not?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4187.224" stopTime="4278.091">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well, I'm inclined to think that probably a great deal of difficulty between the states and that because, in some states, as in Florida, the taxes are on the property itself irrespective of the interest in the properties. 
    Although, we do have two or three instances where at least a whole interest can be assessed, but that has only been in recent years. 
    Now, I don't know what type of a rule we may have in other states. 
    And, in Florida, up until within recent years, the tax is, well, assessed against the real estate and not against the owner but the real estate itself. 
    And, that was true irrespective of the number of least a whole interest in it. 
    So, in that state, and I don't believe he's in the -- there may be a rule now on recent law but, in that state, the owner of the real estate would have to pay the taxes to protect his real estate. 
    Now, the owner of a least whole interest might've had to pay to keep somebody else from getting it, but we did not have separate assessments for the oil interest and the remainder until -- in recent years. 
    So that, in Texas, a Judge, from his argument, that has not -- amend the rule out there.

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Suppose Florida should enact a law and you're after all debts pointing to people shall be considered as real estate, should we act on the assumption in deciding a rule here that we were governed by that law?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4294.848" stopTime="4310.888">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well, if you're going to consider debts being an intangible that follows the owner of the debt, then we may run into some interstate trouble on that. 
    And, it's --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4310.888" stopTime="4344.416">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, the problem I had in mind was, suppose they could very easily settle to which state would get it if they, suppose these are all debts, they simply passed a law that, assuming that's right, that all debts are to be treated as real estate in the state and that if we were to hold that all real estates could be of this kind, we'd be governed by the fact that the thing real estate then there wouldn't be much problem left. 
    The states would adopt the law saying that's a real estate, wouldn't it?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4344.416" stopTime="4344.784">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well, a lot --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4344.784" stopTime="4355.869">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    And, we'd be governed by the state's declaration or decision or label of debts if they have such, I don't know if they have, that debts are real estate.
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4355.869" stopTime="4367.238">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well, I don't know that you could say that debts would always be real estate even if we're out of real estate because --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4367.238" stopTime="4369.340">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Well, the state could, for its purposes, couldn't it?

    I think maybe --

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    But what did -- would we have to accept it in determining a rule as to a heap of intangibles including debts?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4378.155" stopTime="4393.580">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    I don't think so. 
    If the rule is as if there maybe -- that intangibles have their status not at the place where they owed, that in the place where the person lives that they owed to.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4393.580" stopTime="4408.724">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I tried to ask you a question but I'm getting mixed up in that old statement. 
    It kind of disturbed me, I am try to decide a new problem by names and labels that were given old situations.
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4408.724" stopTime="4445.037">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Now, I think very properly that a state might have the authority to rule that all debts -- pass a law that all debts drawn out of an oil lease in that state should be considered real estate as to all debts drawn out of oil interest after the passage of the Act itself. 
    But, that gave me considerable trouble as to this. What the status of those interests are?
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4445.037" stopTime="4454.511">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    What difference would it make? They said debts are going out of one thing, a real estate. 
    They can say debts is going out everything out of real estate, couldn't they?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4454.511" stopTime="4503.330">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well, the trouble is that debts are, in some instances, debts arising in Florida are debts owing to somebody else in another state and may not even arise altogether in Florida that this corporation is doing business between a number of states. 
    Well, part of the transaction arose in Florida and the balance of it arose in Texas. 
    So, I don't know just how much trouble you would have working out a uniform law that could applicable in all instances.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4503.330" stopTime="4504.979">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You don't think we can do that?

    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    I'm very doubtful about it. 
    It might be done but, at the present time, I'm doubtful that you can work out a law in Texas that would be binding on 49 other states.
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4522.001" stopTime="4526.440">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    You mean with reference to debts who can escheat them?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4526.440" stopTime="4529.573">

    Yes, because these --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4529.573" stopTime="4532.724">

    But, then, we can adopt no rules, can we?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4532.724" stopTime="4556.473">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well, the only rule that I can see that you might possibly adopt with a reasonable certainty would be the rule of the -- that an intangible like a debt has its status in the state where the person it owed to lived. 
    Now, that's what you were trying to stay away from. 
    That's about the only one that I could think of that --
speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="4556.473" stopTime="4574.592">
    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    Our problem is not whether that old definition of status and so forth, following the owner's direct, but what we're going to do in this situation when debts are owed in and the owner doesn't claim on it, which state can escheat them?
speaker="fred_m_burns" startTime="4574.592" stopTime="4576.209">
    Mr. Fred M. Burns 
    Well, that's the problem.

    Mr. Ralph M. Oman 
    May it please the Court. 
    My time is short and I'll try not to use it all, but I'd like to start with a statement that I believe Mr. Shultz in Texas made to the effect that ruling out one or two of the three choices, we seem to have as to the adoption of a standard would give some other state or might not give some other state a better right to take, and my next cue is a statement by Mr. Chief Justice Warren where he inquired to the gentleman as to where the Solicitor should lie. 
    And, I would like to suggest to Your Honors that, as I view the opinion of this Court in Western Union, the purpose of this constitutionally embodied tribunal under its constitutional rights to determine controversy between states is to set up a standard or a test of some kind by which competing states may be gotten, and whether you call it arbitrary or not. 
    As Mr. Justice Black said, most all rules of law are arbitrary but they're also non-arbitrary in the sense that they're founded on something early, not granted. 
    The three tests proposed here and claimed by the various states may not be the best, may not produce the finest results, but I think it's the best we can do. 
    The Master's report -- I might -- I'm getting little ahead of myself. 
    We were given permission to file a brief amicus here. 
    I represent the Life Insurance Association of America which is composed of 126 life insurance companies writing about 84% of the legal business and the life insurance industry has a tremendous stake in this very problem and it has paid for years on the basis of the last known address. 
    It's member companies have paid millions of dollars and also -- to the states and have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars on the basis of the last known address where it used that as a starting point to locate people who had unclaimed funds.

    Mr. Ralph M. Oman 
    Yes, and starting at the most natural starting point in the world which is the last known address. 
    And, I'd like to submit to Your Honors this question. 
    Whenever property is lost or unclaimed, I don't want to say abandoned and I don't want to say ownerless, but whenever a property is sought to be taken by someone who may claim to be a finder or might, even in the case of states, claim to be entitled to it, although I don't know where their right comes except from the merit, right, and privilege of their sovereignty. 
    The first thing that comes to a person's mind who wants to make a bonafide effort to find the owner and it's the owner's property, it always -- is always the orders about it. 
    Where was he last? 
    Where was he known to have lived? 
    Where was he known to have resided? 
    Where did he have an address? 
    Because that would be the place where at least the Master had furnished adequate proof of the location of the property an intangible within the state where he was last known to have resided. 
    In this very lawsuit, which only involved some $30,000 or $40,000 held or paid into Court by Sun Oil, there has been over $11,000 paid out of these funds to persons who have been located, who have been tracked down and found by going first to the most natural starting point that you can think of, and that's where was he last known to have been before he abandoned the property. 
    We agree wholeheartedly with the Master that the so-called contacts principle, contacts with the transaction, is the least desirable. 
    It -- in my opinion, is not a standard at all.

    Mr. Ralph M. Oman 
    Absolutely and it's the owner that's entitled to any solicitude as far as selecting an arbitrary standard or a standard or a guide, if one can be selected. 
    I think the owner is entitled to much more consideration than either of the claiming states are prone to giving because the states have no right to this property per se. 
    It isn't their property. 
    It's a windfall for them. 
    It's a method of enriching their treasury, and I don't say that they're not entitled to escheat property but I don't think they're entitled to make claim to it under the so-called sufficiency of the contacts theory nor the domiciliary theory, which of course only takes into account property of the debtor. 
    And, the debtor has no proprietary interest and no property right in an intangible. 
    It belongs to the creditor.

    Mr. Joseph H. Resnick 
    Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court. 
    The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania wishes to state its position as being in accord with the opinion rendered by the Special Master and, consequently, no exemptions were filed. 
    Originally, Pennsylvania is here to the sufficient contact theory based on the fact that the Sun Oil Company had its principal office and place of business in Pennsylvania. 
    But after further consideration of the issues and in the light of the Master's report, we've changed our position and we now advocate that -- the last known residence theory and we join Mr. Oman in his arguments. 
    We believe that the last known residence theory is the most practical solution of the three theories advanced because, first, it is a simple, fair, and adequate solution to a complex problem that involves the least amount of litigation. 
    Secondly, it considers the owner's right in the property as well as that of the sovereign and by advertising in the jurisdiction where the owner was last seen or lived or was known. 
    And, this is our position. 
    We cannot add anymore than the arguments already before this Court.

   Argument of Augustus S. Ballard

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Ballard.
speaker="augustus_s_ballard" startTime="5502.772" stopTime="5649.182">
    Mr. Augustus S. Ballard 
    Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court, we come at last to the custodian of the fund. 
    At the outset of this litigation, in which we are a named defendant but have no real interest other than to see a real solution to this problem, we took the position that we could neither admit nor deny the status of the property here sought in Texas or in any other state which was then a party to the proceeding or subsequently became one, but that we would act in accordance with the disposition of the matter as dictated by this Court. 
    The thing that has concerned us, as the case has progressed, is that in considering the complex theory as advanced by the various states we, as the custodian of the property, may become confused as to what we are supposed to do. 
    It is for this reason that we are somewhat concerned about the theory advanced by the State of Texas because we have visions of our comptroller or treasurer, whoever he may be confronted with hundreds of these transactions every year, having to become an expert in the conflict of laws in order to fill out the various reports. 
    The theory adopted by the Master has the virtue, from our standpoint, of being understandable and easy to follow even though, I must say, that it is not, from our standpoint, the easiest theory which could be adopted. 
    If we -- if the Court were to adhere to Mr. Kehoe's theory, that means we've got only one state to worry about or if the Court were to adopt the position originally taken by Pennsylvania, and now abandoned, and that is that the state where the principal office of the debtor is concerned, that would also be an easy rule to follow. 
    However, except for the caveat of making constitutional lawyers out of companies -- the officials of companies who are in charge of filing out these escheat reports, we reiterate our position that we have no axe to grind.

    The Texas law was passed and we filed a report in complete compliance with it. 
    And, actually, it turned out that we were able to find, within the period allowed by the Texas statute, various people, the actual owners of the property.

    It depends on the amount and the type of obligation.

    If you owe a fellow 35 cents for a bag of nails in a hardware store and you send him a check and he doesn't cash it, I think you just let him go at that. 
    You're not going to waste your time pursuing it. 
    But, as a general rule, like any other company, it's – you run the risk, if you pay over to a state of the true owner turning up and wanting his money.

    And, it's the life blood, of course -- of an oil company that its arrangements in the State of Texas and elsewhere where it has oil interests must be right up to the mark, and we avoid, if possible, finding the situation which has occurred. 
    We cannot find the person who owns a fractional mineral interest.

    Mr. Augustus S. Ballard 
    I would think it would be fair to say that all states have escheat laws of one kind or another, but that the number of the states having these omnibus statutes would be in the order of 15 to 20. 
    When I say omnibus statutes, I mean those reaching wages, business debts of all kinds and that kind of thing and not merely a person's dying intestate without heir.

    We would then be enriched. 
    Conversely, if we're a New Jersey corporation and you've gathered from Mr. Kehoe that they have a very active escheat program, but if you adopt a state of incorporation rule, I don't believe Delaware has an omnibus escheat statute and, of course, there are more corporations incorporated in Delaware than any other state. 
    I think that whatever formula you come out with, in some cases, the debtor, the holder, is going to benefit but I also think that that is what is motivating us.

    Mr. Augustus S. Ballard 
    In taking debtors generally, if you take a last known address rule such as the Master has here, and we've got a creditor whose last known address is North Dakota and let's assume for the moment, and I think this is true, that North Dakota has no omnibus escheat Act which would reach unclaimed wages. 
    As I understand, the workings of the Master's rule, we don't have to report that to anyone unless or until the State of North Dakota adopts an omnibus escheat bill. 
    Not all the states have the same kind or as broad as the states actually concerned in this case all have far-reaching escheat statute.

    The fair -- from a standpoint of fairness, I think Judge Huxman has found the fairest rule, assuming again that you can't be absolutely sure of fairness. 
    While it is true that the last known address on our books may indicate he's not there anymore and it may not even have been his residence, it is nevertheless the address which the creditor gave to Sun Oil Company in transacting whatever particular piece of business it happened to be, stock ownership, wages, sale of supplies, whatever it happened to be. 
    And, I think that it -- this really, It makes better sense for that state where his last known address was to claim the money, then the state of incorporation which may have had very little or no connection with the transaction whatsoever.

    I think the last known address according to the books of the company will do for the reason that there is no impetus on the company to hide it and, on the other hand, there is an impetus to keep it current because, as I say, the company will want to pay the creditor. 
    It's not going to sit there and let the last known address become a stale one and I venture to suggest that, at least as far as my plan is --

    On the last known address standard, that one question which we don't want to lose sight of, and all this property is, if this Court adopts that rule and a state escheats it on the basis of last known address and, later on, the creditor should come and sue the company, the company is not going to be protected from double liability which, of course, is the objective of this Court, we think, in this action.

    What happens in life insurance companies?
speaker="charles_j_kehoe" startTime="6293.159" stopTime="6322.128">
    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    In life insurance companies, the statute that I am aware of are all strictly custodial in nature and he can get it back at anytime. 
    Even if the -- if he sued the life insurance company and he got a judgment against another New Jersey statute, New Jersey would pay the life insurance company back. 
    That's just custodial, not escheat. 
    But, under our general escheat statute of course, that does not follow and, in other states, it doesn't follow either.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Before you get to that, Mr. Kehoe, I'm afraid, I didn't follow you.

    Mr. Charles J. Kehoe 
    Sure. 
    Suppose you adopt the last known address and New Jersey proceeds under its 14-year-statute to escheat it. 
    We perfect our right by title. 
    We say that title is vested in the state as to this claim. 
    Now, four years later, the creditor comes in and he sues Sun Oil Company in Illinois. 
    They cannot -- they would have to pay the claim because he said “well, you gave my property away on my last known address. 
    I wasn't even there.” 
    That's the fallacy in the last known address rule.

    I don't know what the result would be because I think this Court would certainly be very liberal, if we plan to come in and wanted his money back as to saying that he was barred, but it's just another element in the problem. 
    And, as to stocks and dividends of a corporation, we vigorously urge that they certainly should be controlled by the state of corporate domicile because, there, that state is the only state with power to recognize the change in ownership of the stock. 
    The corporate charter includes the laws of the state within the charter, and we feel that, as to stocks and dividends, the state of incorporation should be the controlling standard rather than the last known address which, from the very facts, we concede does not now exist.

    Seven years thereafter, he can come in and get his money with 2% interest.
