    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the Court-- 
    Just one week ago, this Court vacated the Florida Supreme Court's November 21 revision of Florida's election code, which had changed statutory deadlines, severely limited the discretion of the State's chief election officer, changed the meaning of words such as shall and may into shall not and may not, and authorized extensive standardless and unequal manual ballot recounts in selected Florida counties. 
    Just four days later, without a single reference to this Court's December 4 ruling, the Florida Supreme Court issued a new, wholesale postelection revision of Florida's election law. 
    That decision not only changed Florida election law yet again, it also explicitly referred to, relied upon, and expanded its November 21 judgment that this Court had made into a nullity.

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    The federal question arises out of the fact that the Florida Supreme Court was violating Article II, section 1 of the Constitution, and it was conducting itself in violation of section 5 of Title III of federal law.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    On the first, it seems to me essential to the republican theory of government that the constitutions of the United States and the states are the basic charter, and to say that the legislature of the state is unmoored from its own constitution and it can't use its courts, and it can't use its executive agency, even you, your side, concedes it can use the state agencies, it seems to me a holding which has grave implications for our republican theory of government.
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="142.381" stopTime="159.858">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    Justice Kennedy, the Constitution specifically vested the authority to determine the manner of the appointment of the electors in state legislatures. 
    Legislatures, of course can use the executive branch in the states, and it may use in its discretion the judicial branch.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="159.858" stopTime="161.607">

    Then why didn't it do that here?

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    It did not do that here because it did not specify... it did use the executive branch. 
    In fact, it vested considerable authority in the Secretary of State, designating the Secretary of State as the chief elections official, and as we point out, the very first provision in the election code requires the Secretary of State to assure uniformity and consistency in the application and enforcement of the election law. 
    The Secretary of State as the executive branch is also given considerably other... considerable other responsibilities, when but... and to a certain extent, especially in connection with the contest phase of the election, certain authority was explicitly vested in the Circuit Court of the State of Florida, which is the trial court.

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, this is serious business because it indicates how unmoored, untethered the legislature is from the constitution of its own state, and it makes every state law issue a federal question. 
    Can you use this theory and say that it creates some sort of presumption of validity that allows us to see whether this court or the executive has gone too far? 
    Is that what you're arguing?

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    No, I would say this with respect... it would have been a perfectly logical, and if you read the statutes, a perfectly logical, especially in the context of a presidential election, to stop this process at the circuit court, and not provide layers of appeal because given the time deadline, especially in the context of this election, the way it's played out, there is not time for an appellate court.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="305.284" stopTime="362.433">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    I have the same problem Justice Kennedy does, apparently, which is, I would have thought you could say that Article II certainly creates a presumption that the scheme the legislature has set out will be followed even by judicial review in election matters, and that 3 U.S. code section 5 likewise suggests that it may inform the reading of statutes crafted by the legislature so as to avoid having the law changed after the election. 
    And I would have thought that that would be sufficient rather than to raise an appropriate federal question, rather than to say there's no judicial review here in Florida.

    I think that I don't disagree with that except to the extent that I think that the argument we presented and amplified on in our briefs is a good argument, it's a solid argument.

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    No, I think that it is particularly in this case where there's been two wholesale revisions, major restructuring of the Florida Election Code, we don't even get close to that question at all. 
    It would be unfortunate to assume that the legislature devolved this authority on its judiciary sub silentio. 
    There is no specific reference to it. 
    But in this case, as we have pointed out, especially the decision of last Friday, there was a major overhaul in almost every conceivable way.

    Mr. Olson, as I understand your argument, you rely on Leser v. Garnett and Hawke v.

    I think in a different context, it's not necessarily the case, and certainly it is true that legislatures can employ the legislative process that might include vetoes by a state chief executive, or a referendum, when the state deliberately chooses to choose a legislative method to articulate a code.

    In the context of this case we're saying that they can include the judicial branch when they wish to do so, but under no circumstances is it consistent with the concept of the plan in the Constitution for the state, sub silentio, the state legislature sub silentio to turn over to the judiciary the power to completely reverse, revise, and change the election code in all of the major respects....
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="535.662" stopTime="570.555">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Olson, with respect to the role of judicial review, you rely very much on the McPherson case, and two things strike me about that case. 
    One is, if you're right on your jurisdiction theory, then should not this Court have vacated instead of affirmed the decision of the Michigan Supreme Court in that case because the Michigan legislature didn't confer upon the Michigan Supreme Court in that case any special authority of judicial review?
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="570.555" stopTime="593.078">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    That's entirely possible that that might be the case, Justice Ginsburg, but the entire text of the McPherson decision and its recitation of the legislative history or the history of legislation and acts by state legislatures to comply with it make it quite clear that the power is vested in the legislature itself.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="593.078" stopTime="618.472">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But there was a decision by the court reviewing, which we affirmed. 
    Under your jurisdiction theory as I see it, there was no role for the Michigan Supreme Court to play because Article II, section 1 gives the authority exclusively to the legislature, and the legislature has not provided for judicial review especially for that measure.
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="618.472" stopTime="660.347">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    I think the context of that case is different, and that it's entirely possible for the Court to have come to the conclusion it did in that case and we believe that case is compelling for the principle that we are arguing in this case, that there is no, the entire structure of what Florida did, its election code, in its effort to comply not only with Article II, but with Section 5 of Title 3, is such that it did not intend in any way to divest itself of the power to determine how the appointment of electors would be determined in a federal presidential election and most importantly, the resolution of cases and controversies, and disputes, with respect to the appointments....
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="660.347" stopTime="687.085">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Three times, at least as I counted in McPherson itself, it refers to what is done by the legislative power under state constitutions as they exist. 
    This is not the most clearly written opinion, and yet three times, they refer to the legislative power as constrained by the state's constitution.
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="687.085" stopTime="743.156">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    And I think that that's important. 
    I agree with you, Justice Ginsburg. 
    It's not the most clearly written opinion. 
    But I think that in the context of that case, the relationship of the legislature to the Constitution in that case and the way that power was exercised, that ought to be reconciled with what we are urging the Court today, that a wholesale revision and abandonment of the legislative authority can't be turned over, especially sub silentio, by a legislature simply because there is a constitution. 
    There is a constitution in every state. 
    There is a judiciary in every state. 
    The judiciary performs certain functions in every state, and to go that length, one would assume that the judiciary in every state under that argument could overturn, rewrite, revise, and change the election law in presidential elections notwithstanding Article II, at will. 
    Now, this was a major, major revision that took place on Friday.
speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="743.156" stopTime="755.714">
    Justice John Paul Stevens 
    Mr. Olson, isn't that one of the issues in the case as to whether it was a major revision? 
    Your opponents disagree, and I know you rely very heavily on the dissenting opinion in the Florida Supreme Court, but which opinion do we normally look to for issues of state law?
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="755.714" stopTime="829.950">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    Well, I think that the dissenting opinion and the two dissenting opinions are very informative. 
    We are relying on what the court did. 
    If one looks at, for example, the recount provisions, before this revision under Florida law, manual recount under the protest provisions were discretionary, completely discretionary, conducted by canvassing boards during the protest phase of the election, postelection period, pursuant to legislatively defined procedures as to who could be present, for seven days after the election with respect to all ballots in a county, that was mandatory and only available, as we heard last week, for tabulation error up until this election. 
    After the decision of December 8th in this context, those remand provisions, I mean those recount, manual recount provisions became mandatory instead of discretionary pursuant to judicial rather than executive supervsion during the contest phase rather than the protest phase, even though it's not even mentioned in the statute with respect to the contest phase, pursuant to ad hoc judicially established procedures rather than the procedures that are articulated quite carefully in the statute.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="829.950" stopTime="853.550">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Well, on ad hoc judicially created procedures, the point of subsection 8 of 168. 
    I mean, once we get into the contest phase, subsection 8 gives at least to the circuit court, leaving aside the question of appellate jurisdiction, about as broad a grant to fashion orders as I can imagine going into a statute.
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="853.550" stopTime="889.833">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    Well, to read that, to read that provision and it's written quite broadly, but to read that, one has to read that in the context of the entire statutory framework. 
    If one reads it the way the Florida Supreme Court did, the entire process is tilted on its head. 
    Where there used to be the decision that was in the election officials, it now becomes in the court. 
    All of the limitations on the remand process that existed during the protest phase, where the standards should be lower because it's earlier in the process are thrown out the window. 
    The time tables are thrown out the window. 
    The process that exists are there and one has to....
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="889.833" stopTime="891.645">

    What's the timetable in 168?

    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    There is no timetable.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="893.112" stopTime="902.077">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    That's right.

speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="902.077" stopTime="917.400">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    But that's only if you untether 168 entirely from the statute and the steam by which the protest phase takes place over a period of seven to 10 days in the context of this election, and the contest phase occurs over the next four weeks.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="917.400" stopTime="966.145">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    It may well be and I'll grant you for the sake of argument that there would be a sound interpretive theory that in effect would coordinate these two statutes, 166 and 168, in a way that the Florida Supreme Court has not done. 
    But that's a question of Florida Supreme Court statutory construction and unless you can convince us, it seems to me, that in construing 168, which is what we are concerned with now, and its coordination or lack of coordination with 166, the Florida Supreme Court has simply passed the bounds of legitimate statutory construction, then I don't see how we can find an Article II violation here.

speaker="joseph_p_klock" startTime="1844.858" stopTime="1895.603">
    Mr. Joseph P. Klock 
    I'll try to answer that question. 
    You would start, I would believe, with the requirements that the voter has when they go into the booth. 
    That would be a standard to start with. 
    The voter is told in the polling place and then when they walk into the booth that what you are supposed to do with respect to the punch cards is put the ballot in, punch your selections, take the ballot out, and make sure there are no hanging pieces of paper attached to it. 
    The whole issue of what constitutes a legal vote which the Democrats make much ado about presumes that it's a legal vote no matter what you do with the card. 
    And presumably, you could take the card out of the polling place and not stick it in the box and they would consider that to be a legal vote. 
    The fact is that a legal vote at the very basics has to at least be following the instructions that you are given and placing the ballot in the box.

    Without being disrespectful, Your Honor, I think you have answered the question in terms of phrasing the question. 
    There are any number of statutory schemes that you could select from if you were a legislature, but as a court, I don't think that the Supreme Court of Florida respectfully, or any other court can sit down and write the standards that are going to be applied.

    Mr. Joseph P. Klock 
    Your Honor, if they are not properly, if the ballot is not properly executed, it's not a legal vote. 
    The only case in Florida that even touches upon this in terms of a machine ballot is the Hogan case from the Fourth District Court of Appeal. 
    In the Fourth District Court of Appeal, that candidate lost by three votes, and he went during the protest phase to the canvassing board and asked for a manual recount to be done and they exercised their discretion and said no. 
    And in that case, there is a discussion. 
    He raised the argument that there were ballots in there that had hanging chads and this that and the other thing. 
    They would hear none of it and when it went up on appeal, it was affirmed. 
    So the fact of the matter is that the only case that we have that deals with this handles it in that fashion, and I would respectfully suggest that a ballot that is not properly punched is not a legal ballot. 
    And I think also, sir, if you go through an analysis of the Vice President's arguments in supporting what the Supreme Court does, there is sort of an omelet that is created by going and picking through different statutes. 
    For instance, the clear intent standard comes from a statute that deals with a damaged ballot where you have to create, to put through the machine, a substitute ballot, and there are very clear directions as to what to do to preserve the integrity of the ballot. 
    And the Beckstrom case, which you will no doubt hear much about as the argument proceeds, dealt with that kind of situation. 
    There was a manual recount there; the court did not pass on the propriety of it. 
    The issue was if the election officials took ballots and marked over the ballots instead of creating a separate substitute ballot, they took that ballot and marked it over so it could go through an optical scanner, which the court found to be gross negligence whether they would discount the votes. 
    That was the issue that was present there. 
    So I think if you look through Florida law it is relatively clear that there was no basis whatsoever to be able to find....

    I think what the Florida Supreme Court should do in that instance is note the very tight restrictions that exist under the protest phase. 
    They require that you find voter intent with respect to a damaged ballot. 
    They also vested in the canvassing board, and the canvassing board is composed of a certain, a defined group of officials, a county judge, the election supervisor, the chairman of the county commission, it is very limited.

    It was not designed to handle voter error and that is absolutely clear because otherwise, Your Honor, what would occur is the following. 
    That in every election that have you that was close, you would have an automatic recount and then irrespective of what the canvassing board does, just load all the ballots together and put them on a truck and send them to Tallahassee because if there is no standard whatsoever and in any election contest that you are unhappy with the election, you can send the ballots to Tallahassee, then have you a problem that is created that would not exist....

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Could we begin with jurisdiction, first?

    Mr. David Boies 
    Yes.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2391.214" stopTime="2429.996">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    The Supreme Court of Florida said that it took, that it was cognizant, and the legislature was cognizant of 3 U.S.C. Section 5. 
    And for convenience sake, let's call that new law. 
    That's not exactly the-- 
    --When the Supreme Court used that word, I assume it used it in a legal sense. 
    Cognizance means to take jurisdiction of, to take authoritative notice. 
    Why doesn't that constitute an acceptance by the Supreme Court of the proposition that 3 USC section 5 must be interpreted in this case?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2429.996" stopTime="2455.407">
    Mr. David Boies 
    I think, Your Honor, and obviously this Court and the Florida Supreme Court is the best interpreter of that opinion, but I think a reasonable interpretation of that opinion is to say that what the Florida Supreme Court meant by cognizant is that it was taking into account the desire to get the election over in time so that everyone would have the advantage of the safe harbor. 
    I think that goes throughout the opinion.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2455.407" stopTime="2472.229">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, the language used in 3 USC section 5 is garden variety language so far as the courts are concerned. 
    We can determine whether or not there is a new law or an old law. 
    That's completely susceptible of judicial interpretation, is it not?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2472.229" stopTime="2473.821">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Yes, I think it is, Your Honor.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2473.821" stopTime="2497.656">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    All right. 
    And it seems to me that if the Florida court, and presumably the Florida legislature have acted with reference to 3 USC section 5 that it presents now a federal question for us to determine whether or not there is or is not a new law by reason of the various Florida supreme... two Florida Supreme Court decisions.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2497.656" stopTime="2518.803">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Except, Your Honor, what the Florida Supreme Court did I think in its opinion is to say that in terms of looking at how to remedy the situation, it needed to be cognizant of the fact that there was this federal deadline out there that was going to affect Florida's electors if that deadline was not met.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2518.803" stopTime="2524.332">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    Well, of course the deadline is meaningless if there's a new law involved. 
    That's part of the equation, too.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2524.332" stopTime="2543.560">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Yes, but what I would say is that whether or not there is a new law, that is whether there's a change in the enactment in the language of the statute or the constitution, is something that has to be decided in the initial instance by the Florida Supreme Court interpreting Florida law.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2543.560" stopTime="2566.862">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    There really... Mr. Boies, there are really two parts to that sentence of section 5 we're talking about. 
    One is the law in effect at the time and the other is finally determined six days before the date for choosing the electors. 
    Do you think the Florida court meant to acknowledge... it seems to me since it's cited generally, they must have acknowledged both of those provisions.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2566.862" stopTime="2583.652">
    Mr. David Boies 
    I don't know exactly what was in the Florida Supreme Court's mind, but I think that in general what the Florida Supreme Court made quite clear is that the thing that was constraining it was the desire to fit its remedy within the safe harbor provision.
speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="2583.652" stopTime="2588.229">
    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    So that's the finally determined portion of section 5?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2588.229" stopTime="2600.113">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Yes, Your Honor, yes, I think that's right. 
    And I think it does not reflect a desire to change the law or in any way affect what the substantive law is. 
    What the court is saying is....
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2600.113" stopTime="2614.358">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

speaker="david_boies" startTime="2628.994" stopTime="2635.740">
    Mr. David Boies 
    I think that it would be unusual.

    I think they probably could not....
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2635.740" stopTime="2639.379">

    Consistently, because that would be a new law under section 5, wouldn't it?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2639.379" stopTime="2645.314">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Yes, because it would be a legislative enactment as opposed to a judicial interpretation of an existing law. 
    Remember....
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2645.314" stopTime="2648.906">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy

speaker="david_boies" startTime="2648.906" stopTime="2680.363">
    Mr. David Boies 
    I think not, Your Honor, because if you go back to the State against Chappell in 1988, where the Florida Supreme Court faced the very question of whether or not that sevenday period was an iron curtain that came down, the Florida Supreme Court said it was not. 
    The Florida Supreme Court said that you had to look as to whether there was substantial compliance. 
    In that case three days was found to be substantial compliance. 
    That was a situation in which there was telephone notice, which was not adequate for certification. 
    That was then followed up....
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2680.363" stopTime="2692.467">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But if we assume the legislature would run contrary to the new law prohibition in the statute, wouldn't the Supreme Court do it if it does exactly the same thing?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2692.467" stopTime="2703.885">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Except what I'm saying, Your Honor, is that it wasn't doing exactly the same thing because it wasn't passing a new law. 
    It was interpreting the existing law. 
    If the legislature had said, for example the legislature....
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="2703.885" stopTime="2716.521">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    I'm not sure why... if the legislature does it it's a new law and when the supreme court does it, it isn't. 
    Both would have to require... you have to preclear judicial rulings and see whether they make new laws, don't you?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2716.521" stopTime="2771.200">
    Mr. David Boies 
    What I'm saying, Your Honor, is that if the supreme court had rewritten the law the way you hypothesized the legislature rewrote the law, it might very well be a difference. 
    What I'm saying is that the Florida Supreme Court did not rewrite the law in the way that you hypothesized. 
    What the Florida Supreme Court was confronted with was a statute, and that statute said that... and it was the later passed statute, we get back into the may and the shall. 
    The may statute was the later passed statute, and so what the Florida Supreme Court said is we have to look at what is the criteria by which you decide whether you may ignore and will ignore these returns, and what the Florida Supreme Court said, we're going to interpret that exactly the way we've interpreted it for 25 years, and 12 years before the Florida Supreme Court made this decision, it had made the State against Chappell decision in which it had approached it from exactly the same policy grounds.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2771.200" stopTime="2819.900">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, it was quite a different... I mean, there, indeed, telephone notification had been given within the deadline, and the actual written material was not submitted until a few days after. 
    I think that's quite a bit different from extending the period generally and for all submissions for, you know... but if I could... I'm not sure that you and Justice Kennedy are disagreeing on very much. 
    It seems to me you acknowledge that if the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of this law were not a reasonable interpretation, just not one that would pass normal judicial muster, then it would be just like the legislature writing a new law, but your contention here is that this is a reasonable interpretation of Florida law.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2819.900" stopTime="2833.894">
    Mr. David Boies 
    I think the way I would put it, Your Honor, is that if you conclude that the Florida Supreme Court's interpretation of Florida law is either a sham or it is so misguided that it is simply untenable in any sense....
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="2833.894" stopTime="2834.144">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Right.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2834.144" stopTime="2847.295">
    Mr. David Boies 
    I think at that point then you can conclude that what it has done is it has changed the law, but I think the standard is the standard this Court has generally applied in giving deference to state supreme court decisions.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2847.295" stopTime="2886.278">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    But is it in light of Article II? 
    I'm not so sure. 
    I mean, I would have thought that that bears on the standard, frankly, when it contemplates that it is plenary power in the legislature. 
    Does that not mean that a court has to, in interpreting a legislative act, give special deference to the legislature's choices insofar as a presidential election is concerned? 
    I would think that is a tenable view anyway, and especially in light also of the concerns about section 5.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="2886.278" stopTime="2917.346">
    Mr. David Boies 
    I think, Your Honor, that if the Florida Supreme Court in interpreting the Florida law, I think the Court needs to take into account the fact that the legislature does have this plenary power. 
    I think when the Florida Supreme Court does that, if it does so within the normal ambit of judicial interpretation, that is a subject for Florida's Supreme Court to take.
speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="2917.346" stopTime="2939.726">
    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
    You are responding as though there were no special burden to show some deference to legislative choices.

    Mr. David Boies 
    Your Honor, if I could, one of the things that was argued from the beginning by Governor Bush's counsel and accepted by the Florida Supreme Court was that the protest statute and the contest statute were very separate procedures. 
    There was a time limit in the protest contest prior to certification, but there is no time limit in the contest statute process, which is what we are in now, and I think that the Florida Supreme Court was focusing on this contest period, which is what is really before, was before them and is before you, and in the contest--

    I think there is a uniform standard. 
    The question is whether that standard is too general or not. 
    The standard is whether or not the intent of the voter is reflected by the ballot.

    In this case... in this case what we are concerned with is an intent that focuses on this little piece of paper called a ballot, and you would say that from the standpoint of equal protection clause, could each county give their own interpretation to what intent means, so long as they are in good faith and with some reasonable basis finding intent?

    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But here you have something objective. 
    You are not just reading a person's mind. 
    You are looking at a piece of paper, and the supreme courts in the states of South Dakota and the other cases have told us that you will count this if it's hanging by two corners or one corner, this is susceptible of a uniform standard, and yet you say it can vary from table to table within the same county.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="3415.567" stopTime="3447.897">
    Mr. David Boies 
    With respect, it is susceptible of a more specific standard, and some states, like Texas, have given a statutory definition, although even in Texas, there is a catchall that says anything else that clearly specifies the intent of the voter. 
    So even, even where states have approached this in an attempt to give specificity, they have ended up with a catchall provision that says look at the intent of the voter.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3447.897" stopTime="3509.232">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    But they have ended up with a catchall provision because I assume there may be cases in which the general rule would otherwise operate in which there is an affirmative counter indication to what the general rule would provide, but I think what's bothering Justice Kennedy and it's bothering a lot of us here is we seem to have a situation here in which there is a subcategory of ballots in which we are assuming for the sake of argument since we know no better that there is no genuinely subjective indication beyond what can be viewed as either a dimple or a hanging chad, and there is a general rule being applied in a given county that an objective intent or an intent on an objective standard will be inferred, and that objective rule varies, we are told, from county to county. 
    Why shouldn't there be one objective rule for all counties and if there isn't, why isn't it an equal protection violation?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="3509.232" stopTime="3521.212">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Let me answer both questions. 
    First, I don't think there is a series of objective interpretations, objective criteria that would vary county by county.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3521.212" stopTime="3543.078">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    All right. 
    But on the assumption that there may be, if we were fashioning a response to the equal protection claim, and we assume as a fact that there may be variations, wouldn't those variations as, from county to county, on objective standards, be an equal protection violation?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="3543.078" stopTime="3556.120">
    Mr. David Boies 
    I don't think so. 
    I don't think so, Your Honor, because I think there are a lot of times in the law in which there can be those variations from jury to jury, from public official to public official.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3556.120" stopTime="3600.868">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Yes, but in jury to jury cases, we assume that there is not an overall objective standard that answers all questions definitively. 
    We are assuming that there is detail that cannot be captured by an objective rule. 
    The assumption of this question, and I think, I think it's behind what's bothering Justice Kennedy, Justice Breyer, me and others, is, we're assuming there's a category in which there just is no other... there is no subjective appeal. 
    All we have are certain physical characteristics. 
    Those physical characteristics we are told are being treated differently from county to county. 
    In that case, where there is no subjective counter indication, isn't it a denial of equal protection to allow that variation?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="3600.868" stopTime="3630.620">
    Mr. David Boies 
    I don't think, I don't think so, Your Honor, because... and maybe I am quarreling with a premise that says there are these objective criteria. 
    Maybe if you had specific objective criteria in one county that says we're going to count indented ballots and another county that said we're only going to count the ballot if it is punched through. 
    If you knew you had those two objective standards and they were different, then you might have an equal protection problem.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="3630.620" stopTime="3654.142">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    All right, we're going to assume that we do have that. 
    We can't send this thing back for more fact finding. 
    If, if we respond to this issue and we believe that the issue is at least sufficiently raised to require a response, we've got to make the assumption, I think at this stage, that there may be such variation, and I think we would have a responsibility to tell the Florida courts what to do about it. 
    On that assumption, what would you tell them to do about it?

speaker="david_boies" startTime="3704.122" stopTime="3722.177">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Yes, that's what I was going to say, Your Honor, that what you have here is you have a series of decisions that people get a right to object to is all going through a process, the people are there. 
    They submit written objections, and then that's going to be reviewed by a court.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="3722.177" stopTime="3784.933">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Well, all right. 
    That causes me some problems that pertain not just to the equal protection aspect of this, but to the rationality of the supreme court's opinion, because the supreme court opinion on the one hand said, as you've just repeated, that there was to be de novo review by the circuit judge in Leon County. 
    But on the other hand, it said that he had to accept the counts that had come out of Palm Beach and Broward counties. 
    It was clear that Broward and Palm Beach counties had applied different criteria to dimpled ballots. 
    One of them was counting all dimpled ballots, the other one plainly was not. 
    How can you at one and the same time say it's a de novo standard as to what is the intent of the voter, and on the other hand say, you have to accept, give some deference to, quite differing standards by two different counties? 
    That's just not rational.

    Mr. David Boies 
    Your Honor, I think what the court held was not include both Broward and Palm Beach. 
    I think it was Palm Beach and MiamiDade, because Broward was not part of the trial because Broward had been certified, and with respect to MiamiDade and Palm Beach, I do not believe that there is evidence in the record that that was a different standard. 
    I don't... and there's no finding at the trial court that that was a different standard. 
    Indeed, what the trial court found was that both MiamiDade and Palm Beach properly exercised their counting responsibilities, so I don't think....

    Yes, just intent. 
    They used clear intent of the voter.

    That's the one that Petitioners' counsel is referring to. 
    In 166, it refers in subsection 7(b) to the intent of the voter, but Palm Beach used the clear intent of the voter and found hundreds of ballots that they could discern the clear intent of the voter from that were not machine read. 
    Now, in doing so, they were applying Florida law, and like the law of many states, it has a general standard, not a specific standard.

    On the other hand, if you found a ballot that was indented all the way through, you counted that as the intent of the voter.

speaker="david_boies" startTime="4012.828" stopTime="4067.180">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Well, Your Honor, because in Florida law, since 1917, Darby against State, the Florida Supreme Court has held that where a voter's intent can be discerned, even if they don't do what they're told, that's supposed to be counted, and the thing I wanted to say about the Beckstrom case is that was a case that used optical ballots. 
    Voters were told, fill it in with a number two pencil. 
    Several thousand didn't. 
    They used everything else, but not a number two pencil. 
    And so the machine wouldn't read it. 
    It was voter error. 
    The Supreme Court in 1998, well before this election, said you've got to count those votes. 
    And in fact, they counted those votes even though the way the canvassing board dealt with them was to go back and mark them over with a big black marker, which made it impossible to check whether the canvassing board had really just marked over the ballot or had put a new mark on the ballot.

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Boies, can I come back to this discrepancy between Palm Beach and Broward County? 
    I'm reading from footnote 16 of the Florida Supreme Court's opinion. 
    On November 9, 2000, a manual recount was requested on behalf of Vice President Gore in four counties... MiamiDade, Broward, Palm Beach, and Volusia. 
    Broward County and Volusia County timely completed a manual recount. 
    It is undisputed that the results of the manual recounts in Volusia County and Broward County were included in the statewide certifications.

    Yes, Your Honor.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="4097.872" stopTime="4121.737">
    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    And those statewide certifications the Supreme Court ordered to be accepted. 
    So it is... the Supreme Court, while applying a standard of supposedly de novo review of the certifications, is requiring the Circuit Court to accept both Broward County, which does one thing with dimpled ballots, and Palm Beach County, which does something clearly different.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="4121.737" stopTime="4145.430">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Your Honor, the de novo review is in the contest phase, and neither Volusia County nor Broward County was a contest filed. 
    What the Supreme Court holds is that you've got de novo review in a contest. 
    A contest relates to specific ballots that are contested. 
    The ballots in Broward and Volusia were not contested by any party.
speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="4145.430" stopTime="4155.768">
    Justice Antonin Scalia

    Mr. David Boies 
    I think what the Supreme Court is saying is you have got a certification. 
    That certification shows a certain vote total. 
    Now, you take that certification until it is contested, and it can be contested by either or both parties. 
    You do not have, until it is contested, you do not have contested ballots. 
    Once have you contested ballots, then going back to State against Williams, Nuccio against Williams in 1929, cited in our papers, then it becomes a judicial question, and what the court holds is you then look at that as a judicial matter and that is why you have going on in Leon County the review of the MiamiDade ballots under the court's supervision. 
    Now, I would point out that we asked to have the MiamiDade ballots reviewed. 
    We also asked to have the 3,300 Palm Beach ballots reviewed, but the supreme court said no to us on that. 
    They said yes, you can have the 9,000 MiamiDade ballots reviewed. 
    They also said, which we didn't ask for, they said as a matter of remedy, we want to review the undervotes all around the state.

    Mr. David Boies 
    No. 
    That is a result of adding the socalled undervotes that were mentioned and the socalled overvotes that were mentioned. 
    Either an undervote where no vote registers for president or an overvote where two or more registers for president are discarded, because you can't vote twice, and if you vote not at all, and in either circumstance, your vote doesn't get counted.

speaker="david_boies" startTime="4331.077" stopTime="4345.617">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Well first, nobody asked for a contest of the overvotes, and the contest statute begins with a party saying that there is either a rejection of legal votes or an acceptance of illegal votes.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="4345.617" stopTime="4383.476">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    But as a matter of remedy it's ordered a statewide recount in counties where the ballots were not contested, and that's where I'm having some difficulty, and it goes back to, in part to your answer that you gave to Justice Stevens... Justice Scalia about Broward County, and in part to the answer you are giving to Justice Stevens now. 
    Why is it that you say on the one hand to Justice Scalia, oh, well, these weren't part of the contest, but now all of a sudden we are talking about statewide, not all of which were contested, but we are not talking about the overvotes?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="4383.476" stopTime="4445.249">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Two parts to the answer. 
    The reason that I said what I did to Justice Scalia was that I think that if this Court were to rule that there was something wrong with the statewide recounts, that they were being done by canvassing boards as opposed to directly by the court, or because the court was not supervising the particular expression of voter intent, what the court would have done is simply cut back on a remedy that we didn't ask for. 
    The second part is that when you are dealing with overvotes, remember, this is a machine issue. 
    When you are dealing with overvotes, the machine has already registered two votes. 
    Now, there may be another vote there, a dimpled vote or an indented vote that the machine did not register. 
    But once you get two votes, that ballot doesn't get counted for the presidency.
speaker="stephen_g_breyer" startTime="4445.249" stopTime="4468.567">
    Justice Stephen G. Breyer 
    They gave an example. 
    The example they gave in their brief was there is a punch for Governor Bush, and then there is a punch for writein and the writein says I want Governor Bush and so I think their implication is that that would have been rejected by the machine, but if you looked at it by hand the intent of the voter would be clear. 
    Now I don't know if there are such votes, but they say there might be.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="4468.567" stopTime="4484.639">
    Mr. David Boies 
    There is nothing in the record that suggests that there are such votes. 
    If anybody had contested the overvotes, it would have been a relatively simple process to test that because you could simply test it as to whether the double vote was a writein vote or was another candidate.

    I gathered from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida that the Vice President did not ask for as broad a recount as the Supreme Court granted, but that it thought that to do just what he wanted would be unfair and therefore out of fairness, they granted the wider recount, am I correct in that?

    Justice Antonin Scalia 
    Mr. Boies, I have one other perplexity about the scheme that's been set up here. 
    What... there is a very, as you point out, there is scant statutory provision concerning, concerning the contest. 
    There is quite detailed statutory provision concerning the protest period. 
    And it tells everybody how to act and time limits and all of that. 
    Why would anyone bother to go through the protest period, have these ballots counted by the canvassing boards, have them certify the results? 
    Why go through all that when the whole thing begins again with a contest? 
    There is no, no... once a contest filed, the certification is meaningless. 
    What advantage is there to win the protest?
speaker="david_boies" startTime="4559.406" stopTime="4593.907">
    Mr. David Boies 
    It's not meaningless. 
    It becomes the baseline, and in every contest that has ever taken place, including this one, that has been the baseline that has determined 99-plus percent of the votes, and what is contested are simply those ballots that during the protest phase have been identified as disputed ballots, so that the, the protest phase solves 99 percent of the election or more. 
    What is left over are those ballots that one side or the other has contested, and that's what the contest deals with.
speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="4593.907" stopTime="4647.293">
    Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
    My concern is that the contest period as we have been talking about requires the setting of standards, judicial review, and by reason of what I take it to be your earlier position in the litigation, this period has been truncated by 19 days, causing the time frame of which we are all so conscious, making it difficult for appellate review, and it seems to me, and we are getting back to the beginning of this, that the legislature could not have done that by a statute without it being under law, and that neither can the Supreme Court without it being a new law, a new scheme, a new system for recounting at this late date. 
    I'm very troubled by that.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="4647.293" stopTime="4690.197">
    Mr. David Boies 
    But, Your Honor, at this... leaving aside the prior case about the extension of the time for certification, which I think at this stage you have to leave aside because at the contest stage, what you are doing is you are contesting specific ballots whether or not they were included in the certification. 
    It's absolutely clear under Florida law that that's what the contest is about, so at the contest stage, the only question is can you complete the contest of the contested ballots in the time available? 
    Everything that's in the record is, that we could have and indeed we still may be able to, if that count can go forward.

    I think the Florida court has sort of ignored that old Boardman case.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="4939.033" stopTime="5014.112">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Your Honor, I think the Boardman case relates not to the counting of votes, it has nothing to do with the standard in terms of the intent of the voter. 
    The Boardman case, the language that you're referring to is at page 268 of the Southern Reporter report of that case, and what is clear from that page and that discussion is it's dealing with the issue of whether or not because the canvassing board threw away the envelopes from the absentee ballots so they could not be checked, whether that invalidated the absentee ballots, and the court says no, it doesn't, because it's important to count all these votes, and because we assume that what they were doing was proper. 
    That does not, I respectfully suggest, at all deal with the question of deference to the voter intent determination which the court has repeatedly said is a matter for judicial determination. 
    The other thing that I would say with respect to intent is I know the Court is concerned about whether the standard is too general or not. 
    Some states have made specific criteria their law. 
    Other states, not just Florida... 10 or 11 of them, including Massachusetts, in the Dellahunt case that we cited, has stuck with this very general standard.

speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="5017.079" stopTime="5049.723">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Mr. Boies, let's assume that at end of the day the Leon County, Florida judge, gets a series of counts from different counties, and they heard those counties have used different standards in making their counts. 
    At that point, in your judgment, is it a violation of the Constitution for the Leon County judge to say, I don't care that there are different standards as long as they purported to fall on intent of the voter, that's good enough. 
    I'll extend your time by two minutes, Mr. Boies.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="5049.723" stopTime="5068.856">
    Mr. David Boies 
    Yes. 
    I do not believe that that would violate the equal protection of due process clause. 
    That distinction between how they interpret the intent of the voter standard is going to have a lot less effect on how votes are treated than the mere difference in the types of machines that are used.
speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="5068.856" stopTime="5077.618">
    Justice David H. Souter 
    Then the fact that there is a single judge at the end of the process, in your judgment, really is not an answer to the concern that we have raised.
speaker="david_boies" startTime="5077.618" stopTime="5159.974">
    Mr. David Boies 
    No, I think it is an answer. 
    I think there are two answers to it. 
    First, I think that the answer that they did it differently, different people interpreting the general standard differently, would not raise a problem even in the absence of judicial review of that. 
    Second, even if that would have raised a constitutional problem, I think the judicial review that provides the standardization would solve that problem. 
    The third thing that I was saying is that any differences as to how this standard is interpreted have a lot less significance in terms of what votes are counted or not counted than simply the differences in machines that exist throughout the counties of Florida. 
    There are five times as many undervotes in punch card ballot counties than in optical ballot counties. 
    Now, for whatever that reason is, whether it's voter error or machine problems, that statistic, you know, makes clear that there is some difference in how votes are being treated county by county. 
    That difference is much greater than the difference in how many votes are recovered in Palm Beach or Broward or Volusia or MiamiDade, so that the differences of interpretation of the standard, the general standard are resulting in far fewer differences among counties than simply the differences in the machines that they have.

    Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist 
    Mr. Olson, you have five minutes 13 remaining.
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="5164.238" stopTime="5209.626">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
    I would like to start with a point or two with respect to the equal protection due process component of this case. 
    The Florida Democratic Party on November 20 was asking the... november 20th of this year, was asking the Florida Supreme Court to establish uniform standards with respect to the looking at and evaluating these ballots, a recognition that there were no uniform standards and that there ought to be. 
    Last Tuesday in the 11th Circuit, unless I misheard him, the attorney for the Attorney General of Florida said that the standards for evaluating these ballots are evolving. 
    There is no question, based upon this record, that there are different standards from county to county.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="5209.626" stopTime="5231.867">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    And there are different ballots from county to county too, Mr. Olson, and that's part of the argument that I don't understand. 
    There are machines, there's the optical scanning, and then there are a whole variety of ballots. 
    There is the butterfly ballot that we've heard about and other kinds of postcard ballots. 
    How can you have one standard when there are so many varieties of ballots?
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="5231.867" stopTime="5240.738">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    Certainly the standard should be that similarly situated voters and similarly situated ballots ought to be evaluated by comparable standards.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="5240.738" stopTime="5244.690">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Then you would have to have several standards, county by county?
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="5244.690" stopTime="5355.164">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    You're certainly going to have to look at a ballot that you mark in one way different than these punch card ballots. 
    Our point is, with respect to the punch card ballots, is that there are different standards for evaluating those ballots from county to county and it is a documented history in this case that there have been different standards between November 7th and the present with respect to how those punch card ballots are evaluated. 
    Palm Springs is the best example. 
    They started with a clear rule which had been articulated and explained to the voters, by the way, as of 1990. 
    Then they got into the process of evaluating these ballots and changed the standard from moment to moment during the first day and again, they evolved from the standard that the chad had to be punched through to the socalled dimpled ballot standard, indentations on the ballot. 
    There was a reason why that was done. 
    It was because they weren't producing enough additional votes so that there's pressure on to change the standards. 
    And that will happen in a situation which is where the process is ultimately subjective, completely up to the discretion of the official, and there's no requirement of any uniformity. 
    Now, we now have something that's worse than that. 
    We have standards that are different throughout 64 different counties. 
    We've got only undercounts being considered where an indentation on a ballot will now be counted as a vote, but other ballots that may have indentations aren't going to be counted at all. 
    The overvotes are in a different category, and in this very remedy the ballots in MiamiDade are being treated differently. 
    Some of them have been all examined and the balance of the process, the remaining 80 percent will be looked at only in connection with the undercounts.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="5355.164" stopTime="5380.184">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    Mr. Olson, do I understand that your argument on the equal protection branch would render academic what was your main argument that's troublesome, that is that we must say that the Florida Supreme Court was so misguided in its application of its own law that we reject that, and we, the Supreme Court of the United States, decide what the Florida law is?
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="5380.184" stopTime="5396.771">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    I'm not sure I know the answer to that question, whether that would render academic the challenge. 
    There is a clear constitutional violation, in our opinion, with respect to Article II because virtually every aspect of Florida's election code has been changed as a result of these two decisions.
speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="5396.771" stopTime="5424.869">
    Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
    But the Florida Supreme Court told us that it hasn't been changed and just looking at one of the cases that you cite frequently, the O'Brien against Skinner case, this court said, well, maybe we would have decided the New York law differently but the highest court of the state has concluded otherwise. 
    It is not our function to construe a state statute contrary to the construction given it by the highest court of the state.
speaker="theodore_b_olson" startTime="5424.869" stopTime="5482.783">
    Mr. Theodore B. Olson 
    The only thing I can say in response to that is that what this Court said one week ago today, that as a general rule the court defers to a state court's interpretation of a state statute, but not where the legislature is acting under authority granted to it by the Constitution of the United States. 
    The final point I would like to make is with respect to section 5. 
    It is quite clear that the court in both the earlier decision and the decision last Friday was aware and concerned about compliance with section 5. 
    It construed section 5 in a way that allowed it by labeling what it was doing as interpretation to change in dramatic respects the Florida election law, and we submit because it did, so misconstrued the applicability not only with respect to finality but the other part of section 5 requires a determination of controversies pursuant to a set of laws that are in place at the time of the elections.
