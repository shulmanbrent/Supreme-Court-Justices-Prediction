    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    I think that in order to get the issues in this case clear I would, if the Court will, I like to give the background facts in this case first. 
    This case arose when the respondent who is the owner of a tropical market grocery and meat store in the Negro neighborhood in Savannah, Georgia. 
    An employee of his, which was about a 15-year-old Negro boy, indicated to his mother that he had been hit by the proprietor of this store. 
    A warrant was taken out for the respondent and he was interrogated and investigated by officers. 
    The mother indicated that after she had made the complaint to the police that she received some threatening telephone calls as a the result that she got in touch with the local N.A.A.C.P. which was in Savannah. 
    They had a meeting and had a circular out in which they indicated people to come to hear about this brutality by this man as a result of the meeting in which one of the defendants below, Mr. Law was the president of the local branch and a Reverend Jordan who was the vice president, attended. 
    The branch decided that they would have picket around the store of the respondent. 
    The testimony on the part of Law is that they put two on each corner around this -- around it. 
    They were instructed to be peaceful and so forth and so on. 
    As a result of this picketing which began on June 1 and lasted until an injunction was issued on June 22, this was suit for damage was brought against the local N.A.A.C.P. against the State N.A.A.C.P. against the two individuals and against a New York Corporation. 
    The -- a word of damages by the jury on the basis of the facts was a $35 judgment -- $35,000 judgment. 
    The ordinary damages against the -- all of the defendants and a $50,000 judgment of punitive damages are against all of the defendants. 
    An appeal was taken through the Supreme Court of Georgia and it was affirmed as to all but the Georgia State Conference. 
    We brought the case here alleging the -- there was a violation of various rights of peaceful picketing and this Court granted certiorari and regrettably limited certiorari to the validity of the judgment as against the New York Corporation. 
    That is the issue which is before the Court at the present time. 
    That is whether the judgment of $85,000 which the New York Corporation is liable is valid and is attainable. 
    We think that the question on that if the Court pleases is not closed. 
    There was no evidence in this record.

    I think we put -- place that -- put that in our brief. 
    The probability is and insofar as the response to the judgment is concerned in this case that the New York Corporation, the Savannah branch and the other people are held responsible, the New York Corporation will be required to pay for it, pay for it at the practical matter and an organizational matter. 
    But this of course, there is a difference between whether we have to do it as a practical matter whether we have a legal responsibility. 
    We don't feel there is any legal responsibility for us under the circumstances of this case, but since the judgment below would in effect mean and that there would be no Savannah branch and the individual defendants would be liable.

    That the law -- there's no testimony that Law in the record that Law did that and certainly these are the facts on which the respondent attempts to show because of the circulars that N.A.A.C.P. mass meeting.

    The New York Corporation was then notified about the fact that this was going on. 
    And I didn't -- it is the position of the -- currently adopted by the Court and the position of the respondent and that the New York Corporation was required to come into court and disavow. 
    We think that -- we think that is error. 
    The question that we -- we don't believe that we were required at that time to come into court and tell the court or tell the respondent in court in the suit -- lawsuit that we disavow the local branch and we had no responsibility for it because it seems to us that what would really be having then is that we prejudice, the position of the local branch in regard to the case. 
    I think that the disavowment or the opportunity to affirm or disavow has to occur before the lawsuit has occurred and I don't believe that anyone can pick up the fact that we didn't take the position in the courtroom after the lawsuit itself as being the basis for it and this is what -- in our -- this is where in our judgment the Supreme Court of Georgia was in error in trying to fix that instead of -- as far as we were concerned.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    On the basis of the fact that I think that what occurs is that we are now in a position in regard to our units where we require the principles as charged with a liability where we're required to come in court and prejudice the rights of our affiliates in a particular litigation by making a confession of some kind in court in regard to the amount of resort.

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well aren't you -- if these people are your agents I can understand that position, but if they're not your agents what's the -- which is your claim here now and has to be on the issue presented here to us and if they're not your agents what's wrong with requiring that you say so?

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well, if they are not -- or if they are our agents or if they're not our agents our theory is that the burden is on the plaintiff to establish his case. 
    The plaintiff it seems to me has to come into a court and he makes -- he wants damages and he says that these people have done something wrong. 
    I think that he has to establish -- he is required to make the establishment before. 
    The respondent has any duty of going forward or making any explanation with --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    Well now, Mr. Carter insofar as this case involves simply the law of agency in the state of Georgia or insofar as it involves simply the sufficiency of the evidence to support factual determination of the agency and therefore to support the Georgia law of respondeat superior, all those issues are no proper business for this Court, aren't they? 
    I think you recognize that because you put this -- you put the question before this Court in terms of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and to that extent isn't the suggestion of my Brother Brennan correct, that there has to be a showing of complete absence of any evidence. 
    I mean you have to show that you think that it's just as arbitrary to take your money and to satisfy this judgment as it would be to take, let's say the money of the -- of the Chrysler Motor Car Corporation --

    Justice Potter Stewart 
    So we're not really concerned here, can't we with the state law of agency or the state that are -- or the sufficiency of the evidence because those are matters of -- for the state courts which we have no business.
speaker="robert_l_carter" startTime="1492.041" stopTime="1550.415">
    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    That's right. 
    The reason for the -- we have raised in our brief on page 17 we -- and beyond we are showing that we read the law that there has been a complete departure from the rules established in Georgia and we think as a matter of fact that this may raise some question of equal protection. 
    But our theory is about this cases that there is no evidence, there is no evidence in this record that would connect us to this case and therefore the judgment is arbitrary and capricious and as a matter of law we said the -- this judgment and this question should never have gone to the jury and it should have been ruled as a matter of law that the New York Corporation was not present and is not responsible.

    Are you setting up the claim that you're not liable?

    Justice Hugo L. Black 
    I'll tell you why I'm asking. 
    I haven't been able to find the case. 
    But many years ago there's a case against the Loyal Order of Moose that they set up that they were -- the head office was not liable for a death that was caused by an initiation. 
    The judgment was rendered and that went all the way up to the Supreme Court of the State and then came to this Court later on. 
    And this Court held that the other state was bound to recognize the judgment under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. 
    I do not recall how much it has to do with this but it seems to me that it's in the realm of the area, general area, which you're arguing this --

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well I think Mr. Justice Black that I'm not claiming here that under no circumstances can a case be made whether the New York Corporation would have responsibility for some act that's done and carried out locally.

    [Inaudible] they got the man place another, is that a branch law or is the law -- now, he testified to a number of things indicating and pretty much what you have told us you know, was the relationship between the branch and the parent corporation. 
    As I remember the such things any part of the funds they've collected and they go back. 
    He said that policy is made of the national conventions and that sort of thing and we have to adhere to the policy. 
    Now why is it that you suggest that that under the Georgia rule accepting what you have said to be the Georgia rule namely that the plaintiff has the burden of proving this agency, why do you suggest that the Georgia courts could not as a matter of Georgia law accept this as sufficient evidence to prove agencies.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well because of two things. 
    One, Mr. Law testified that the New York Corporation didn't know anything about what was going on that's in the record. 
    They weren't notified. 
    They knew nothing about it until after the suit was filed.

    This is in -- in the record itself.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    Well Mr. Carter, may I ask you, test is to that -- it isn't -- the test is of agency would not deal with it whether the New York Corporation knew of these particular events. 
    The test of agency is whether the actor, here, Mr. Law was in fact agent and that doesn't require knowledge of you folks in New York, does it of what he was doing.

    Mr. Robert L. Carter 
    Well that's true. 
    That maybe true but what you're talking about now is that sort of -- is a general agency by virtue of the fact that the management is involved in the organization. 
    Therefore, we have some general responsibility and under these circumstances our general responsibility we suggest to the Court in terms of due process, the only way on which the Savannah and Mr. Law were held liable was on the basis of the fact that there were acts which were violent acts which violated the laws that there were threats and intimidation and therefore that -- it would have to be shown specifically that the New York Corporation, the principle would be involved in giving specific ratification or firm acclamation and a pull of those specific acts because otherwise the one is -- it is - it is all for violation and there are arguments (Voice Overlap)

    These are the allegations that has been made that he was acting for the New York Corporation and so forth but as I try to indicate before there has been no showing of the -- it was the acting clause and if you take the basis on which responsibility has been held since the illegal acts and acts of violence I think that we have to indicate that the New York Corporation in carrying out a general policy of who to condone ourselves before this -- we could be held liable under this circumstances.
