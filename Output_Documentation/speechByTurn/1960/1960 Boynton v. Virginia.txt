   Argument of Walter E. Rogers

    Mr. Walter E. Rogers 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I think that this Court has very clear conception of the facts in this case. 
    There are two I think I might mention. 
    It is clear that the petitioner was a passenger in interstate commerce. 
    His traveling in interstate commerce would've been in Richmond (Inaudible). 
    He left the bus and came into a private owned and operated restaurant located in the terminal building in Richmond. 
    That privately owned restaurant operated separate facilities for members of each race. 
    The testimony is specifically clear that the restaurant is in no way affiliated with or controlled by the bus company. 
    It operates under a lease, just as a lease of any other business establishments at such of its term at least it's on the record but the policies of the restaurant with those other restaurant. 
    Petitioner came into the section which is reserved for white patrons and was informed that he could not be served there, and that he would have to go into the other portion of the restaurant which is reserved for Negroes. 
    He refused to leave the premises and when he refused to do so, he was directly arrested for trespass after warning. 
    The Virginia statue is quoted at page 4 of the brief on behalf of the Commonwealth. 
    And it simply provides that it is not a segregation statute at all. 
    It is a statute which provides that if any person shall without any authority law go upon or remain upon the grounds of premises of another, after having been forbidden to do so by the owner or the person in control, then he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. 
    That statute has been on the statute books of Virginia since 1934.

    Mr. Walter E. Rogers 
    1934, it was enacted as Chapter 165 of the Acts of the Government (Inaudible) in 1934. 
    There have been one or two amendments since that time. 
    The provision for sign was included after the warning by signs and anyone who is familiar with the legislative history of that statute as to where the fact of that provision was put in there to deal with these unattended parking lots where automobiles were driven in a private property where there was no attendants so that happen to be the reason why that was inserted in. 
    The statute does no more than impose criminal sanctions -- criminal actions for continued trespass after the party is instructed to leave without authority -- if he is --

    If he had any right either by contract with the party or anything of that sort or -- if he was proceeding as a peace officer or if this is a matter involving interstate commerce where he derives some way to go there as being an interstate passenger then he is there with authority of law and would not be guilty of trespass when refuses to leave but he has first got the authority whereby -- which he is owned the private property.

    I would say it's upon him to show it. 
    It's a defense to his actions in the premises because I think you can say. 
    Though, I don't think absolutely it's not evidence. 
    This is an affirmative defense if he is going to show that he carries a search warrant or that he has some right to be there. 
    The only right this man asserted in this case was, "I am an interstate passenger. 
    Here's a ticket I'm using to ride on the bus." 
    That was the elements of his contention that as why we was lawfully there.

    He offered no other proof of it and that was why he was there. 
    The evidence is to why he was there is clear.

    Mr. Walter E. Rogers 
    There is still no evidence that Richmond Bus Terminal, Inc. controlled or operated this restaurant. 
    I might say this first, as far as the assignments of error are concerned, and really what was considered by the courts below, in this case, first originated on the motion to dismiss the warrant, it's found on page 6, the petitioner relied on two rights. 
    One right afforded him by the Interstate Commerce Act, and the other, by the Interstate Commerce Clause itself. 
    The provision as far as the Act I believe seems to be above except on the basis of this evidence that is tendered here for the first time. 
    The evidence, it was not considered by any of the courts below. 
    They haven't considered the effect of that one way or the other and these certified copies of the ICC that is tendered by the amicus curiae. 
    That has not been before the Virginia Courts, either the Supreme Court or the lower court. 
    That evidence had been introduced below what kind of evidence would have been offered regarding the history of these companies I don't know in meeting that question, but the warrant -- the most when they dismissed the warrant, they did raise Interstate Commerce Act. 
    They apparently abandoned it early in the game. 
    It was not made a basis of an assignment of error to the Virginia Supreme Court. 
    The assignments of error appear on page 5 and the contention on that score is that the Court erred in refusing to dismiss the prosecution on the ground which the statute has applied, that is the Virginia Statute, unconstitutionally attempts to regulate commerce. 
    That I take it, it presents a constitutional question not a statutory question. 
    The petition for writ certiorari to this Court does not make this point that the Interstate Commerce Act, it's -- I mean, the Interstate Commerce Act itself gives this right.

    That's right. 
    The restaurant is operated as one as a -- in the terminal building but it says, local train as well as passengers that may come in to the terminal, whether in intestate commerce or otherwise, The -- the white restaurant is in one section, the colored restaurant in another. 
    The petitioner could've been served there, it was not crowded, the evidence shows that. 
    So that is the status of the record on that point here. 
    The Interstate Commerce Act, the reason I think that counsel has not pressed the Interstate Commerce Act question is the fact that counsel of record here was also counsel of record in N.A.A.C.P. versus St. Louis and San Francisco Railway which involved a hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission as to the practices of a number of operating railroads, the railroad terminal building at Broad Street in Richmond, Virginia and also a leased restaurant facility within that building operated by I believe the Union News. 
    The ICC, the agency which Congress had set up to carry out the Interstate Commerce Act and enforce the policies and declaration of policies of Congress had the question as to whether a lessee non-carrier concern operating a restaurant in a terminal building was required to serve without discrimination. 
    The ICC held I believe in 1955 and 1956 that the Interstate Commerce Act did not apply to such privately owned and operated lessee non-carrier concern in the operation of its restaurant facility in the railroad terminal station in Richmond, Virginia. 
    So far as I'm aware, Congress has not taken any further steps to extend its noted power to regulate interstate commerce to specifically say that such a closely related facility should be operated on a nondiscriminatory basis. 
    Now in that case, the ICC had evidence that the terminal corporation there was in fact owned and controlled by operating carriers in an interstate commerce, evidence that we do not have here except as -- has been offered here by a (Inaudible).

    No -- no finding about the Court one way or the other but if the Act had been pressed and this question of operating control had been shown, what the evidence would've been as developed as to how many years this particular carrier had been operating in the City of Richmond, you got a terminal facility which it didn't even know how to control and operate. 
    Well, they have -- it ever had a restaurant before that for 19 years or 30 years, it might well have been developed. 
    That is why I think it is improper at this stage to begin to consider evidence dealing with the -- with the control.

    They started selling whiskey by the drink in the operator or the lessor object that he has a right to say it so. 
    But the extent of the control between the two companies is not specified in this brief which is on the record. 
    The Interstate Commerce Act, the same language of viewing into section which was substantially the same in Section 4931 dealing with common carriers and railroad section I believe. 
    And in the Chapter 300 chapter in Section 316 (d), with 4931 was on the book pro--prohibiting the carriers. 
    It prohibits carriers as it prohibit anybody thus performing any function and have a closely all -- distantly related to interstate commerce.

    It regulates carriers. 
    316 (d) again regulates carriers by motivators and it prohibits discrimination in any form by them. 
    Now, the evidence here as far as this terminal is concerned, the terminal itself as distinguished from the rest which under the control of the terminal corporation. 
    If the consideration be given to any ownership or control of that corporation, the terminal facilities where there was no policy of segregation in any of its facilities, it's restaurant and the like, were there was no requirements, the evidence in this -- and this right that it there was no segregation at all in connection with the operation of the terms.

    Under the Act as written today as I -- I did not know of any -- any kind. 
    I do not deny that the Interstate Commerce Commission may have such regulatory power. 
    You conclude that the furnishing of meals in connection with bus transportation is essential just like in -- in connection with the Railroad Act where a person is on a train and he stays on the train all the way across the country. 
    They can be very much in order mandated with that provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, which would give the Commission power to pass a regulation stating that that is a part of the essential service which he may perform. 
    In some of provisions maybe in the Act regulating carriers by Motor, I'm not aware of it. 
    I don't -- it certainly wouldn't be beyond the -- it certainly would be improper for Congress to conclude that bus transportation travel should do it, and to give that power to the Commission. 
    And if the Commission has exercised that power, and the bus companies were required, then I think it's a service of -- they will have to perform even direct or through some agency where the lease operation all the while.

    I have been in the -- I have been in the restaurant and I have seem to recall that there are separate -- there are separate counters, there are separate rooms but I'm not sure that you can't see over an open space either over the counter from one to the other. 
    It maybe that I have in mind the last petition, but I frankly don't --don't remember. 
    I have been there and it -- to the best of my recollection -- to the best of my recollection, there are two separate rooms and that's -- that's what I think of the -- but I make this comment in this record, there were few comments have been made a bit the Negro state of the record on the -- on the issue that was presented here as to the offense, the testimony that this was a privately operated restaurant. 
    The lease was introduced. 
    The directions to leave, his presence, his direction to leave and he refused to leave. 
    That constituted the case as far as the common law is concerned. 
    If any of these other factors that we have been struggling with here are important, I am certain that able counsel for the petitioner could have presented them and presented them to the court below. 
    Now, on that scope, certainly I'm not – criticizing, I think they have that position, he took his position that has in interstate carrier, he had a constitutional right to come into the white section and eat, and that was his point. 
    He made it in the restaurant at the time and that's all it was stood. 
    And that's why I say this question of -- of controlling anything, he says that's because it's in this building. 
    And because these buses come in here and I am being in the interstate commerce, I've got a right to eat without being required to go into this section or that section. 
    Now, if -- if he would have flashed ticket on a bus company to the restaurant across the street, insofar as he was concerned, the principle would be the same and that's -- that's why we're here in this state of the -- the record.

    We will not do in some bus companies do. 
    We will just let you off and give you time to seek your meal somewhere else as some, they didn't. 
    But we will -- we will provide it ourselves and if the bus company, the carrier that is operating is subject to regulation under the Act did that, then, I think it has to provide it without any discrimination in giving the service to its patrons. 
    And I think that if the bus company were operating this restaurant and the man came in to get a service which regards to whether the manager told him to get out, and he had a right under the Interstate Commerce Act to be there, then you couldn't bring in by your State statute, it wouldn't be trespass because he would be lawfully there.

    Well, certainly on a long bus trip, you got to eat three times a day. 
    I think we would consider that and that you would -- during your passage you would certainly expect the bus company to at least stop, give you an opportunity to eat.

    In fact, there are number of restaurants in Virginia that have desegregated their facilities in a matter of recent months.

    There is no compulsion on the part of the State. 
    There is no effort being made in Virginia and introduced places who have voluntarily chosen the course of desegregation to make them change their policies and the police don't come in and try to seize if any action is enforced.

    I see my time is up. 
    I haven't touched on all phases of this review with the matters that are covered by the brief. 
    I think that the counsel for the opposition of -- I give too much consideration in the Fourteenth Amendment question but we think it's controlled by the reason on this lower court level in Maryland decision. 
    And if that very issue was involved and by this action in Paul against Virginia involving this very statute that was considered by the Court there and its rulings of -- on that in refusing to consider the case. 
    I want to call your attention to one typographical error on page 16 of our brief.

   Rebuttal of Thurgood Marshall

    Mr. Thurgood Marshall 
    Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court. 
    I'd like to start with few moments I have with the answer to Mr. Justice Brennan's question. 
    I think it should also be added that although this public statement has been made and indeed in facts, Negroes are being served in the bus terminal involved in this, the signs are still up and I submit now, we really got a situation. 
    Boynton has not only got to find out who owns that terminal, he's going to have to find out just what is the whim of the manager on the day he gets there. 
    Because as it appears with the sign still up, and he was served and I assume that they would serve today and tomorrow they should be back. 
    And I think that's the other point that I've been trying to get clear about this different system as it moves along which is the opposite of what the Congress intends in its commerce power that it be uniform throughout. 
    On the question as to these rooms in the restaurant itself, I find out from associate who have tried this case that the two -- it's -- it's a long one wall and there is a wall between the white section and the colored section. 
    There is a wall there with doors coming out. 
    And it -- it's not a temporary wall or what have you, but for all intents and purposes it's the same restaurant but for the wall and here, we have the same situation of making somebody move from one to the other.

    Mr. Thurgood Marshall 
    Oh, yes, sir. 
    I -- under the Morgan case, I think that it's perfectly clear that -- and from the argument that's been made here by Mr. Rogers that there is no question that the bus company put Boynton in this bus terminal. 
    They pulled up, they'd let him off in the bus terminal and that whether it's owned or operated by whomsoever, it pleases, it is an essential part. 
    The only thing in the bus terminal are the ticket counters, restrooms, a waiting room, and the lunch counter, I mean the restaurant and certainly, that restaurant is just a significant part of that is that, if they have separate counters to buy tickets or separate restrooms, he wouldn't have any trouble. 
    I think you had also -- while we're on this lease. 
    We're trying to figure out what paragraph 24 on page 16 says because it requires them, the restaurant to administer -- to run this building according to the rules and regulations of any governmental agency having jurisdiction thereof, then it says that having down below, the lessor should apply with the ordinance of the City of Richmond and the laws of the United States in the State of Virginia. 
    And I would submit that I think I know what they were driving at that this was to be a terminal restaurant as represented up in the beginning where they're required to run the terminal facilities.

    No, I've never seen one of -- this is the first one on the bus terminal. 
    And I was reading in relation to that state. 
    That was the section I was reading in the legislature because I -- I think Mr. Justice Whittaker, in complete honesty that this is obviously a lease that has a combination. 
    It looks to me like the lease that the -- the regular sections would be for the restaurant as mentioned by Mr. Rogers across the street. 
    But the fact that those of us know when we run across leases that that time on provision is entirely different. 
    You don't have that in a normal lease. 
    You would have for example in the -- the lease in the gas company that you would run it to serve our employees, etcetera, etcetera or in the shopping center would be like a shopping center.
