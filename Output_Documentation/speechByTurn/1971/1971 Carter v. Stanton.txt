    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court. 
    This case is here on direct appeal from a judgment of three-judges District Court for the Southern District of Indiana which dismissed appellants complaint for failure of federal jurisdiction. 
    The issues involved are jurisdiction of questions pertaining both to the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the appeal under Section 1253 of the judicial code and to the jurisdiction of the three-judge District Court. 
    The plaintiffs in this action were mothers of dependent children to at the time of filing their complaint in the District Court had been denied either the right to file an application for aid to families with dependent children or had been denied assistance under that program. 
    Jurisdiction below was founded on Section 1343(3) and (4) of the United States code and the action was brought under Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. 
    Plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and as a class action on behalf of other mothers similarly situated. 
    The Social Security Act defines a dependant child as a needy child who has been deprived of parental care or support by reason of the continued absence from the home of a parent. 
    Plaintiffs alleged that they were entitled to assistance under this provision because their husbands and the fathers to their children had deserted the home. 
    Plaintiffs also alleged in their complaint that aid under this provision was denied pursuant to Indiana regulation 2402(b) which is set forth at the bottom of page 5 of appellants brief. 
    This regulations state when the continued absence is due to desertion or separation. 
    The absence shall have been continuous for a period of at least six months prior to the date of application for assistance except that under exceptional circumstances of need and where it is determined that the absence of apparent is actual and bonafiding, an application maybe filed and a child maybe considered immediately eligible upon a special finding of the County Department of Welfare. 
    A three-judge court was convened to hear the plaintiffs allegation that this regulation was not only unconstitutional, but was also contrary to provisions of the Social Security Act.

speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="217.107" stopTime="219.649">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    Yes it was brought as a class action Your Honor.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="219.649" stopTime="230.120">
    Justice Potter Stewart 
    The class being parents whose spouses had not been absent for six months or more?
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="230.120" stopTime="471.307">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    That is right. 
    Mothers who had been denied welfare benefits under this regulation because the husband had not been away from the home for a period of six months. 
    Following the convening of the three-judge court, each of the two appellees, the County Department of Public Welfare and the State Department of Public Welfare filed motions to dismiss the complaint. 
    These motions were based primarily on two grounds. 
    One, a failure on the part of the plaintiffs to exhaust their state administrative remedies, and secondly the failure of the complaint to raise substantial constitutional questions. 
    The three-judge panel then convened a combine hearing both on the motions to dismiss and on the merits of the case. 
    Evidence was heard from approximately 16 witnesses and at that point the court adjourned the hearing and granted the motions to dismiss. 
    The court's entry appears at page 210 of the appendix and on page 212 of the entry. 
    The entry demonstrates that the decision of the court was based one upon the court's finding that each of the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their state administrative remedies, and secondly, the court held we have examined the pleadings before us and find no substantial federal question involved nor do we find federal jurisdiction under 28 US(c) Section 1343(3) and (4). 
    It is apparent to the appellants from this entry that the District Court resolved none of the conflicts in testimony which became evident during the course of the hearing. 
    Rather, it made it so finding that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust state administrative remedies and then on the basis of the pleadings and solely on the basis of the pleadings, it found that no substantial federal questions were presented for decision. 
    Before turning to the correctness of the decision of the District Court, the appellee, the State Department of Public Welfare has raised a threshold question in this case pertaining to this Court's jurisdiction under Section 1253 of the judicial code. 
    As we understand the argument, the appellants and the appellee’s contention is that in failing to find substantial federal question, the three-judge panel in effect dissolved itself and that therefore the final entry should be construed as having been the decision of a single district judge. 
    In support of that decision the appellee relies primarily upon two per curium decisions of this Court. 
    Mengelkoch versus Wilson, Mengelkoch versus The Industrial Welfare Commission and Wilson versus City of Port Lavaca. 
    Without repeating all of the argument set forth in appellants reply brief, we believe that this case is significantly different from those decisions and that here there was no express finding by the three-judge panel that it had been improperly convened. 
    The final decision in fact was entered by all three-judges. 
    In addition, it is apparent from the entry that in large part, the decision of the District Court was based upon the failure to exhaust state administrative remedies. 
    And as we read this Courts decision in Idlewild Liquor Corporation against Epstein that is a consideration which could be properly made only by three-judge court and not by a single district judge. 
    Furthermore the Court here convened the hearing on the merits as well upon the motion to dismiss and took extensive evidence from approximately 16 witnesses. 
    Again, we submit that this is a procedure which could be followed followed only by the three-judge court.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="471.307" stopTime="487.577">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Could that not also mean that having heard 16 witnesses conceivably, it concluded that there was no problem for three-judge court? 
    I am not suggesting it was, but could that not also be an explanation?
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="487.577" stopTime="594.720">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    It is certainly conceivable Mr. Chief Justice that the three-judge panel could have heard witnesses and decided on the basis of the testimony induce that the complaint failed to raise substantial constitutional questions and dissolve itself and then left the final judgment for single district judge. 
    By not doing so, we believe the District Court here recognized in fact that it was not making a determination. 
    Within the meaning of, for example Ex parte Poreski (ph) that the complaint failed to raise substantial constitutional questions, but made that decision on the basis of a finding of a failure to exhaust state administrative remedies. 
    We submit that what has happened here is the District Court has taken this Court's decision in King versus Smith and turned the formula around and said in this case substantial constitutional questions are not raised because there was a failure to exhaust state administrative remedies, and we submit that that is a determination which could made only by the three-judge court. 
    In support of appellants position on this point, we believe the recent decision of this Court on October 12 of this year in a case of Hicks versus Pleasure House, Inc. is instructive or in that decision, the Court characterized the Wilson decision and the Mengelkoch decision as holding that an appeal may lie to a Court of Appeals from certain action of a single district judge in a case required to be heard by three-judges. 
    And again here we have no action of a single district judge, but a final appealable judgment entered by the three-judge court.

    All done in the same proceedings.
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="653.883" stopTime="827.702">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    That is correct. 
    Turning now to the precise nature of attacks on the regulation below. 
    Appellants have attacked the regulation at the bottom of page 5 of their brief, both on constitutional and statutory grounds. 
    Two attacks were made on the basis of the regulation is unconstitutional on its face. 
    The first attack relates to the requirement that where the separation has been for a period of less than six months. 
    Exceptional circumstances of need must be shown in order to secure a waiver. 
    We see no rational basis for saying that if the separation has been for less than six months, a child must be exceptionally needy. 
    While if the separation has been for more than six months mere need is sufficient. 
    Therefore, we argue below that this particular provision of the regulation constituted a denial of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. 
    We do not believe that this question is rendered in substantial or frivolous by the Court's decision in Dandridge against Williams. 
    We have an entirely different factual situation, a different type regulation in this case. 
    A regulation under which the appellant and other applicants have been denied all aid. 
    We do not have here a maximum grant type regulation where the families are already receiving some type of assistance and a maximum level is established. 
    Secondly, the appellants have attacked the regulation on its face as granting a standard list and arbitrary discretion to the administrator. 
    As pointed out, in order to secure a waiver of the six months requirement, a special finding must be made by the County Department of Public Welfare. 
    Two of the plaintiffs in this case alleged in the complaint that no investigation had been made into their circumstances upon which such a special finding could be based. 
    On this basis, we believe the administrator has discretion as to whether to conduct an investigation in any particular case. 
    The discretion which is not guided by any standards. 
    Furthermore, whether it is a failure to conduct an investigation, the regulation in effect enacts and concludes the presumption that an absence for less than six months cannot be a continuous absence. 
    In these particular cases therefore, we have a rigid six month waiting period and the same type of regulation or statute which was involved in the Damico case and in the Minnesota case of Bill versus Hersh (ph).

    Unknown Speaker 
    I thought they were shorter than six months.

    Mr. Jon D. Noland

speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="844.005" stopTime="854.561">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You are not claiming that any time period would necessarily be violative of the statute, of the constitution, would you?
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="854.561" stopTime="857.759">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    We believe that any time period --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="857.759" stopTime="875.043">
    Unknown Speaker 
    I mean that conceivably, a man could leave in the morning at 7:30 and 24 hours later his wife can go and apply for assistance saying, my husband left this morning and well, I know he is not going to come back.
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="875.043" stopTime="890.996">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    That is correct Your Honor, obviously situations will vary, in some cases the administrator maybe able to reach a determination that if absences continued two or three days after the husband departs. 
    In other cases, it may take longer to arrive at that determination. 
    We do believe --
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="890.996" stopTime="894.923">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    Are you suggesting that 30 days would be unconstitutional?

    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    I am suggesting and no Your Honor that it would not be unconstitutional but anything above that would be a violation of the Social Security Act.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="903.149" stopTime="907.771">
    Unknown Speaker 
    At least so far is it where almost conclusive presumption?
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="907.771" stopTime="908.391">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    That is correct.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="908.391" stopTime="909.026">
    Unknown Speaker 
    So that is what you mean.
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="909.026" stopTime="1293.563">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    That is correct. 
    I think our primary problem with this regulation is relating the exceptional circumstances of need requirement to a durational requirement. 
    We could see no rational basis for saying that even though it maybe difficult to arrive at a determination of continued absence that a waiver will be granted only if exceptional circumstances of need are present. 
    We believe that violates Social Security Act which speaks of needy children and not exceptionally needy children. 
    In addition, the appellants have alleged in their complaint that there is a statewide policy in practice under this regulation of requiring applicants to file for legal separation or divorce in order to secure a waiver of the six month period. 
    The testimony before the three-judge panel on this question was directly conflicting. 
    There was evidence on behalf of plaintiffs that such a practice had been engaged in, at least in their cases and in other cases. 
    The administrators on the other hand denied the existence of any such practice. 
    As we think as apparent from the Court's entry, the Court they know fact finding as to whether this practice did or did not exist. 
    Apparently, assume the existence of the practice and yet nevertheless found that the constitutional issue is raised for insubstantial. 
    Appellants urge that such practice that exist as alleged constitutes denial of First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment. 
    Turning now to the question of exhaustion of administrative remedies, we think this is the primary basis for the decision of the District Court. 
    As appellants have read, the prior decisions of this Court there is an absolute exemption from any exhaustion requirement or actions brought under the Civil Rights Act. 
    This is been established both by the Damico versus California and King versus Smith. 
    We submit that there is important policy justification for such an exemption. 
    Cases such as this under the Civil Rights Act and particularly welfare cases involve essentially or primarily questions of Federal Law whether the constitutional law or statutory law. 
    We see no need therefore for the State Administrator to consider State Law to make any fact finding based on the record before an administrative agency or to apply their expertise or discretion. 
    The regulation here is being attacked both on its face and does apply. 
    We believe these issues can properly be determined by a Federal Court without exhaustion. 
    In addition, if exhaustion is to be required in certain cases we submit that this is not such a case because the administrative remedy is inadequate. 
    There is no identical administrative remedy in Indiana. 
    That remedy is solely individual in nature, there is no class action procedure before the administrative agency. 
    In addition that an administrative appeal does not result in any decision of general applicability throughout the state. 
    Now the appellee's state department in this has devoted a large portion of its brief to arguing that full discovery rights are available in administrative proceedings in Indiana. 
    The appellants do not dispute that proposition as a matter of statute but law. 
    However, the very record in this case demonstrates that any pursuit of discovery before the administrative agency would be entirely feudal. 
    The plaintiffs below filed both subpoenas and motions to produce to obtain copies of case files and other documents pertaining to the application of the challenge regulation. 
    Both the State Department and the County Department resisted any motion to produce on the basis that the records requested were confidential in nature. 
    And in a letter to the Court and to Council dated November 5, 1970 State Welfare Department stated, I specifically request that you obtain a court order to require Mr. Sterick (ph) to produce these files at the time of his proposed examination. 
    The County Welfare Department said essentially the same thing in an affidavit filed in support of their objection. 
    Now it is essential in case such as this that the plaintiffs have access to the documents in order to establish their constitutional allegations that this regulation has been applied in such a manner as to be contrary to the Equal Protection Clause. 
    Yet the appellees have told us in this very case that they will require a court order in order to produce the documents requested. 
    Appellants know of no procedure in Indiana whereby a Court order can be obtained without filing a law suit. 
    Therefore we submit, we are back right where we started from. 
    The appellants would receive none of the documents in an administrative proceeding and would be required to file the very law suit which now before Your Honors. 
    And additional basis for the decision of the District Court appears to have been a reliance upon Mr. Justice Stone's distinction made in Hague versus CIO that no jurisdiction lies under the Civil Rights Act where the complaint raises only questions relating to property rights and not to personal rights incapable of valuation. 
    We believe that the prior decisions of this Court have satisfied this question that jurisdiction does lie under the Section 1343(3) whether it is denial of welfare benefits, since it had been recognized that such a denial does involve important aspects of personal liberty. 
    Therefore we urge that the District Court urge in dismissing the complaint on this ground.

    That the plaintiffs were not required to exhaust their state administrative remedies and as the District Court adds jurisdiction under Section 1343.

    Mr. Mark Peden 
    That arose because in 1875 after Federal Courts were given jurisdiction over this type of the case were given a power to enjoin state statutes. Federal judges quite freely exercised this injunctive power and public resentment reached quite a peak an especially after decision of this Court in Ex parte Young in 1908 where the power of the Federal judge is to enjoin state regulatory scheme was upheld. 
    The injunctions where often granted simply on the basis of affidavits in Ex parte proceedings. 
    The public resentment were such that Congress in 1910 passed the Three-Judge Act. 
    So it now requires three-judges or state statute can be struck down and they further protected the state interest by providing that any appeal should go direct to the Supreme Court. 
    So the whole impetus for the Three-Judge Act was to protect state interest from interference by the injunctive power of Federal Courts. 
    It was not to protect parte such as plaintiff in this case.

    Mr. Mark Peden 
    The practical difference is not that great but under Section 1253 that is a technical enactment is to be construed very narrowly and this Court has said that several times and if the plaintiff cannot show that the action of the Court below took in regard to his case was such as the constitute in order denying or granting injunctive relief and come within that language very literally, then he is out of ballpark as far as 1253 goes. 
    Even though, it maybe that he is asked for an injunction and he has not got it. 
    So the practical effect is that he is lacking in his injunction but he has to come within the literal strictures of 1253.

    Perhaps for spending too much time on it conceivable it seems at least that Judge Turner thought that it was important enough to have three signatures on the disposing order because he authorized one of the other two Judges to sign for him or at least to that stage it would look as though the judges were thinking that they were a three-judge court. 
    Not that one of them could dispose the case and maybe you better get along to the merits of your argument.
speaker="mark_peden" startTime="1991.351" stopTime="2321.912">
    Mr. Mark Peden 
    We believe that the Indiana six month requirement is not violated of the equal protection because it is found it in rationality. 
    In the previous case, the court had difficulty distinguishing between the college student and a vocational student. 
    But there can be no doubt that under a six month requirement, the standard or the continued absence is going to be a lot more clear. 
    The longer the parent is absent from the house. 
    The six month requirement is founded in the common sense belief that when a father leaves a family, it would be very likely that the standard of need, soon after the father leaves is not as grace it will be later. 
    The regulation also contains a clause which states that in cases of exceptional circumstances aid maybe available. 
    This clause means that when -- since standard, the evidence below indicate that the standard of need that recall for a family for aid after six months was the same as used by the Welfare Department in a determination of who met exceptional circumstances before six months. 
    The basis of the ruling is that when a man leaves the house, there will be some money or the family would be able to at least subsist for a length of time, and that it is necessary in order to prevent fraud in order to ensure that the continued absence is real. 
    Now, it is our position that this does not violate equal protection because under the Dandridge case, the court noted that the test of such a regulation is whether or not it is reasonable, whether or not it is brief in various discrimination. 
    The AFDC program was described as a program of cooperative federalism. 
    The states have leeway and under the statutory argument, aside from the equal protection argument, it is our position that 406 as a definition is not mandatory in binding up on the states. 
    This is already brought out in the last case to quite an extent. 
    We feel that the requirements that are binding upon the state as suggested by the Solicitor General are in Section 402. 
    These requirements have been settled with effective dates whereby in order to meet these requirements, the states have to comply by a certain date. 
    Whereas Section 406, the definitional Section are no effective dates. 
    This in busy just then that the real requirements of the act. 
    The ones which would require the states to perhaps enact legislation that will enable them to meet the requirements that Section 402 is a Section which actually establishes binding requirements on the state and legislative history of this act fully supports this, all the remarks in the senate reports cited by the Solicitor General’s brief in this case, amply support the view that Section 406 establishes the outer boundaries of state participation for which federal funding will be available. 
    And that Section 402 is the only of section of the act which is mandatory upon the states. 
    Section 402(b) states that the secretary will approve any plan which complies with that section meaning 402 and the requirements in 402(a). 
    It does not say that the secretary will refuse to approve plans because a fail to commit the definitional requirements in Section 406. 
    So we submit that on the basis of standards case, there is no conflict with equal protection under the six month rule and then upon the basis of the legislative background and the internal consistency of the Social Security Act, there is no conflict with that act neither. 
    Thank you, the rest of time will be taken by my partner Mr. Geddes. 
   
   
   
   Argument of Robert W. Geddes
speaker="robert_w_geddes" startTime="2321.912" stopTime="2435.219">
    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    Mr. Justice Douglas, may it please the Court. 
    With the limited time, I would like to make it perfectly clear to the Court that the appellee Wayne Stanton, his position is that we should not be in the Federal Court. 
    Not whether that we should be in this Court so much or whether or not we should be in the Federal Court if the doctrine of abstention or the doctrine of exhaustion administrative remedies had any meaning under this type of case. 
    With respect to the merits of this case, it is fully covered in our briefs, it is fully covered with case law. 
    There were charges in there that the applicants or the claimants says we could not file an application unless we sued for divorce, unless we filed for legal separation. 
    The evidence is clear in fact two of the claimants alone received benefits less than three month after their husbands separated and they never filed for divorce. 
    There was a witness Smith, she testified that she filed her application immediately and within a month she received aid, she never filed for divorce. 
    There was a witness Blake LaClair (ph) she receive aid in two months after separation, never filed for divorce. 
    So as far as this six month requirement under the Indiana Regulation, all the six month is a guideline. 
    In other words, after six months is a conclusive presumption. 
    But if the need is there and the absence is action bonafide, the regulation says that the person can receive aid immediately. 
    That distinguishes this case from Damico and all of the others where was a three month situation sue start.

    The District Court held Your Honor Mr. Justice that there was no substantial federal question and the claimants did not exhaust their administrative remedies and therefore they said there was no federal jurisdiction.

    What the court did at least in my opinion, they had the pleadings in front and they had the motions to dismiss and they heard 60 witnesses to determine whether the court should take jurisdiction to hear the case, fully hear the case on the merits. 
    There was about ten hours of testimony involved and after concluding that and after hearing the evidence then they made their conclusion notes of substantial federal question on the pleadings and the party failed to exhaust administrative remedies.

    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    Mr. Justice they did not. 
    This case is the only case I could find and the only case I know of where this Court is faced now with the decision to make with respect to administrative remedies. 
    Now the appellant have cited King, they have cited Damico, they have cited Damico and McNeese. 
    But each of those cases, if you look at the merits of those cases, the administrative remedies involved there was either not adequate. 
    It was not speedy or it would have been feudal. 
    For example, in McNeese I believe the parties would have to go back and get -- it was a segregation case, they would have to get %10 of the boarder so many people and then --
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2574.725" stopTime="2579.267">

    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    No, Your Honor they just said that there was under 1983, you did not have the exhaustment state remedy. 
    What has been causing confusion with the Federal Courts is whether this -- the confusion is that if you make a claim under 1983, does that give you absolute right to bypass all administrative remedies and that is really the question before this Court today.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2602.727" stopTime="2614.912">

    First step Mr. Justice is a State Department of Public Welfare and if the party is still dissatisfied then it is reviewed by the State Board of Public Welfare upon his request. And then the applicant can go into either the State of the Federal Court depending on his own choice.

    It is correct Mr. Justice.

    When does it sound like much with administrative proceedings if you really are reviewing the administrative decision on the administrative records?
speaker="robert_w_geddes" startTime="2874.347" stopTime="2904.430">
    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    It could be both Mr. Justice. 
    In Indiana, we adapt the federal rules of civil procedure and discovery. 
    So you have a request for admission your deposition to interrogatory’s everything. 
    You could obtain your entire record administratively. 
    By the way which would only take five weeks and with the request for admissions alone, you would establish a record which the Federal Court could review and possibly avoid a two, three, four week trial.

    Unknown Speaker 
    What is the history of the time it takes to complete the administrative review you described for?
speaker="robert_w_geddes" startTime="2909.167" stopTime="2947.610">
    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    It takes three weeks, two to three weeks to have a hearing once you ask for appeal. 
    And then there is two weeks for decision. 
    Now, one important thing about this administrative review is once the applicant files his appeal ask for appeal, there is nothing formal about, it is all informal, the county is mandated to review the situation. 
    In other words, if you have got a disgranted welfare applicant he says, they will not accept my application which they said here, but which was incorrect. 
    If that happens, all he has to do is informally ask for appeal and the county has to review it.

    This was a law suit of the lawyers not the applicants. 
    Some of the applicants testifying court that when they went to the lawyers or the lawyers called them, they thought they were administratively appealing. 
    They got involved in the federal law suit which took a year practically to be heard just on this question.

    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, the statute permits or the regulations permits relief within the six months. 
    Before the six months expired in the case there is extraordinary need.
speaker="robert_w_geddes" startTime="3070.872" stopTime="3071.866">
    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    Yes, that is correct.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3071.866" stopTime="3076.283">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Was there any attempt here to get that kind of extraordinary relief?

    Yes there was.

    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    No, it was granted. 
    Dorothy Enoch one of the claimants who said, I could not get and wait six months. 
    She received benefits in two months after her husband left the house.

    But all of them did not.

    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    No, Lucille Hall received it in a few months. 
    Brenda Steel that is one of the claimant said, she said, I did not even have any need problems I was living with my post. 
    But this six months is only a conclusive presumption. 
    In other words, if the need is there in the absence that action bonafide you can get it immediately and the evidence show that.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3112.417" stopTime="3116.949">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well that would mean there is -- really is there any case of controversy here?
speaker="robert_w_geddes" startTime="3116.949" stopTime="3118.869">
    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    That is correct Mr. Justice.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3118.869" stopTime="3129.207">
    Unknown Speaker 
    If you are really saying that is another strange way of writing a regulation, putting in a regulation that required six month separation and then saying it does not mean anything.
speaker="robert_w_geddes" startTime="3129.207" stopTime="3141.179">
    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    No, it is given in the case where you see a conclusive presumption, if is it over six months. In other words, continued absence you got to have certain period of time. 
    The question is how long, is it a day, week or month.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3141.179" stopTime="3143.855">
    Unknown Speaker 
    You still have to show need after six months, do you not?
speaker="robert_w_geddes" startTime="3143.855" stopTime="3165.602">
    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    You still have to show need and the evidence showed in which we pointed out in our brief. 
    The testimony showed that the standard of need actually applied was the same if it was less than six months or over six months. 
    So this equal protection argument is saying that you depriving somebody less than six months over six months was completely refuted.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3165.602" stopTime="3184.174">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, that is the standard of need. 
    It is the same but it does not -–it is not the finding that there is only parent is the same. 
    You have already told us that after six months has the conclusive presumption that was one parent has left. 
    Before six months there is no such presumption.
speaker="robert_w_geddes" startTime="3184.174" stopTime="3196.976">
    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    Before six months if it shown that it is action bonafide separation in the need they are immediately eligible and that is all that the Social Security Act requires.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3196.976" stopTime="3225.220">
    Unknown Speaker 
    Well, maybe this does not -- what is involved here is perhaps not technically exhaustion of administrative remedies, but rather your claim that in the actual administration of this rule it does mean what it seems to me. 
    Is that what you are saying? 
    That in the actual administration of welfare in Indiana or in Marion County, Indiana that this six months rule is a not administered so as to make it mean what it seems to me. 
    Is that what you are telling us?
speaker="robert_w_geddes" startTime="3225.220" stopTime="3226.646">
    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    That possibly that could be correct.
speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3226.646" stopTime="3242.343">
    Unknown Speaker 
    And that therefore they had proceeded to seek relief under the administrative procedures available. 
    They would have found that this rule was no barrier. 
    Is that it?
speaker="robert_w_geddes" startTime="3242.343" stopTime="3261.540">
    Mr. Robert W. Geddes 
    That is correct Mr. Justice. 
    Here we have a situation where it is build-in administrative procedure and if you can bypass it here and under any 1983 claim then what you are having happen is the Federal Courts in reality are becoming the welfare administrators to review every welfare claim.

    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    How about this, is that the fact?

    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    The fact is Mr. Justice Brennan that several other witnesses did testified that they received aid within the six month period. 
    Two of the witnesses, two of the claimants -- one of the claimants or plaintiffs and one witness were denied aid until the full expiration of the six month period. 
    This is said forth on page 8 of appellants brief. 
    The claimant Bowman filed four applications.
speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="3371.463" stopTime="3373.528">

    That is correct.

    And that she get, did that one get aid after six months?
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="3389.690" stopTime="3400.821">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    The plaintiff Bowman did receive aid after six months. 
    The witnesses Luke was denied aid for six months and she began receiving assistance automatically upon the expiration of the six month period.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3400.821" stopTime="3408.124">

    In another words, that the administrative proceedings have not been completed until six months then they are bound to get their payment.
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="3408.124" stopTime="3414.502">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    Unless circumstances have changed. 
    One of the witnesses for example had found a job in the inter period and did not pursue it any further after the six month period.
speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="3414.502" stopTime="3416.070">
    Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 
    That was an eligibility question.
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="3416.070" stopTime="3482.550">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    That is correct. 
    With respect to the time requirements for the administrative proceedings brought out by Mr. Justice Marshall, the record is very sparse on this question. 
    There is no doubt that what the statute and regulations require that hearings be handled very expeditiously. 
    However, the two week period even from the limited evidence in this record is obviously not followed. 
    On page 28 of the Appendix for example, in response to an interrogatory, Mr. Sterick the State Administrator stated that an appeal was held on December 19, 1969 and the decision was released on April 9, 1970 substantially more than a two week period. 
    Similarly, the only witness who took administrative review testified at page 110 of the appendix that the decision was rendered by the state on December 29 or September 29, 1970 and the hearing was held on August 27, 1970. 
    Again, substantially more than a two week.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3482.550" stopTime="3498.394">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    The statute said that there had to be a showing that the spouse had left without any idea of ever returning. 
    (Inaudible) statute?
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="3498.394" stopTime="3507.792">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    Congress desired to enact such a statute. 
    We would find no moral weapon. 
    The point is --
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3507.792" stopTime="3524.906">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    These things in merit in the argument that this is really not a six months if you go in there and say that my husband left last night with a one trip ticket to -- one way trip to Moscow, she would be eligible. 
    That is what I understand the state's condition.
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="3524.906" stopTime="3529.148">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    I would think the state or the administrator would find that to be a continued absence.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3529.148" stopTime="3535.560">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Well, what is the problem now? 
    Statute, you just object to showing it?
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="3535.560" stopTime="3544.832">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    No, Your Honor we object the showing exceptional circumstances of need which we believe constitutes a denial of equal protection and also a contrary to the Social Security Act.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3544.832" stopTime="3548.966">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    Is it really, you have to show the need even after six months?
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="3548.966" stopTime="3551.780">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    That is correct but you do not have to show exceptional circumstances of need.
speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="3551.780" stopTime="3555.055">
    Justice Thurgood Marshall 
    That is right, but that is where you are on that one.
speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="3555.055" stopTime="3649.245">
    Mr. Jon D. Noland 
    Whatever that requirement means, it certainly must mean more than plain need. 
    And we object to it on that ground. 
    Furthermore, with respect to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, appellants would again urge that the administrative remedy in this case was not adequate. 
    We heard talk again of discovery and yet the record in this very case shows that any discovery effort at the administrative level would be feudal because the State Department has already told us that we must obtain the court order in order to obtain the documents requested. 
    If it stated in Monroe versus Pape, and in the McNeese case, Section 1983 does truly constitute a remedy supplementary to any state remedy and we believe that that must be construed as granting an exemption from exhaustion either of administrative or of your state judicial remedies. 
    In addition of course, there are important federal questions involved in this case. 
    We are talking about essentially federal program under the Social Security Act. 
    We are talking about challenges to a state regulation that has been invalid on space and has applied, and we believe it is appropriate in the case of this nature for those decisions to be made for an impartial tribunal. 
    We see no need to exhaust state administrative remedies in such a case.
