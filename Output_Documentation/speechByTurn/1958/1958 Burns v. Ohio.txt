Burns v. Ohio

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Number 581, William W. Burns, Petitioner, versus State of Ohio. 
    Mrs. Washington.
speaker="helen_g_washington" startTime="16.548" stopTime="386.443">
    Ms. Helen G. Washington 
    May it please the Court, my argument will be very brief. 
    As in Griffin against Illinois and Eskridge against Washington State Prison Board recently decided by this Court, this case concerns an indigent convicted defendant who was deprived of the appeal rights given him by state law, solely because he was too poor to pay one of the costs of appeal, here the docket fee demanded in advance for docketing his appeal papers. 
    As in the Griffin and Eskridge case the only question is whether the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited the state from denying appeal rights given to others, to one who does not have the money to pay the cost. 
    The details giving rise to this question maybe quickly stated. 
    The petitioner was convicted by a jury of a felony in a trial court in Ohio. 
    He was sentenced to life imprisonment in the state penitentiary. 
    Upon an appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals, his conviction was affirmed. 
    Ohio Law gave him further appeal rights in the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
    Under the law there is an appeal as of right if a constitutional question is involved. 
    In other cases one whose conviction of a felony has been affirmed by the Court of Appeals, may move the Supreme Court of Ohio for leave to appeal and will have leave granted if good cause for the appeal is shown. 
    The state statute and the rules of the Supreme Court provide, however, for the payment of the docket fee of $20 before the appeal papers will be docketed. 
    This petitioner who was in the penitentiary without the assistant of counsel prepared a motion for leave to appeal, a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and then affidavit of poverty. 
    He transmitted these papers to the Supreme Court of Ohio together with a copy of the notice of appeal filed in the Court of Appeal. 
    The Supreme Court, acting through its clerk, immediately returned his papers to him, with the explanation that the docket fee required by statute and the Court's rule had not have been paid and that an appeal in forma pauperis was not an acceptable substitute. 
    Thus the Supreme Court of Ohio construed the statute and its rules as denying access through the Court to those who were unable to pay the fee, although everyone else could have his appeal docketed. 
    Under the Griffin and Eskridge decision such a discriminatory interpretation of the statute cannot stand. 
    Since Ohio has a general policy of allowing appeals, or appeal rights in the Supreme Court, it under those decisions cannot consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment deny them to one who does not have the money to pay the cost. 
    I don't think I need to elaborate anymore on that point. 
    We rest our case on the decisions in the Griffin and Eskridge cases. 
    On brief the state advances only one reason why those cases should not apply here. 
    The state says that the petitioner has had one appeal here, his conviction was affirmed and that he is not entitled to anything more, that when Ohio does give a second appeal it can establish any conditions for it that it sees fit. 
    I think that this is a misreading of Griffin. 
    The teaching of that case certainly is that if a state does grant appeal, it should grant it to rich and poor alike, that would be regardless of the level at which appeal was, regardless of whether it was the first, second or tenth appeal. 
    And we submit that this case could return to the Supreme Court of Ohio with appropriate instructions to give petitioner his rights. 
   
   
   
   Argument of William M. Vance
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="386.443" stopTime="392.183">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Mr. Vance.
speaker="william_m_vance" startTime="392.183" stopTime="565.303">
    Mr. William M. Vance 
    Mr. Chief Justice and justices, please the Court. 
    I think the whole question before this Court here is whether or not the effect of Griffin should be extended because in Griffin under the statues of the State of Illinois, felony cases are appealed only and directly to the Supreme Court of Illinois. 
    Misdemeanor cases are appealed to the appellate court. 
    Before our case can be appealed or considered on appeal by the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois, they had to have a transcript. 
    Griffin had no transcript and he said he had no money to buy one, therefore, his case was heard in lower court one appeal. 
    In Ohio it is different. 
    Our primary appellate court is the Court of Appeals, a three-judge court of which we have ten in the state. 
    In this case Burns was convicted in the trial court. 
    He had self retained counsel. 
    He was not a poor man. 
    He appealed to the Court of Appeals. 
    He had his transcript. 
    He got a full appellate review before the Court of Appeals and his case was affirmed. 
    Now at that stage, he filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
    He did the necessary administrative step two of notifying the prosecuting attorney before he filed his application for an appeal. 
    At that time as I say he apparently was not indigent, he had his own self retained counsel. 
    He went out and he had his review. 
    He dropped and abandoned, at that time that contemplated appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
    It was not until years later after Griffin, the Griffin decision had been announced and after he had spent those intervening years in the penitentiary where whatever resources that he might have had when he first went in were undoubtedly dissipated and he was in truth and in fact a pauper, that he then goes and without taking that necessary step of notifying the prosecuting the attorney, he files his notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals and one in the Supreme Court of Ohio and tries to do it on a pauperis affidavit and they send back and say it takes $20 to get here in this Court on that kind of a motion.

    But what I'm -- my point is does he have to -- suppose he had the money, he has already filed one with notice to the prosecuting attorney under his original appeal, now when he seeks to go to the Supreme Court, if he had $20 and paid it, would he have to file another notice with the prosecuting attorney?

    Mr. William M. Vance

    I raised that question in my own mind frankly, whether or not the effect of that first notice would carry over, but the statute says that when a motion for leave to file is -- a motion for leave to appeal is filed, a copy of it shall served first upon the prosecuting attorney and that this was not a proceeding on the notice filed back in 1950, but it was an entirely new notice and an entirely new proceeding.

    That is correct and I can say in all candor to this Court that, that was not why the clerk returned the paper.

    We feel here that the due process, equal protection is not involved, the same rule applies in this man as to all other people who file in the Supreme Court of Ohio. 
    He had his appeal, he had his transcript, and the Griffin decision is rather a black and white affair, it says the rich here and the poor here, actually we as all know life is great mass of grays, with all degrees of fluence in it. 
    That here is a man who has $100 saved up, a hard working man who has $100 to pay the matriculation fee of his son, who wants to go to college and he gets into some trouble and he wants to appeal his case and he has to reach down and take this $100 to get in. 
    But here is the other fellow on the other hand who stole a $1,000 and blew it up in one wild night of entertainment, so he is broke and he gets into that fix and the taxpayers have to let him in for free and furnish him with a lawyer and give him a transcript and let him file a (Inaudible), where the man with a, just a modicum of money has to expend that until he too is a pauper.

    Mr. William M. Vance 
    And I thought over the lunch period what I would say to you and I do believe that this is it, that the rule making power is the Court itself and if they can make rules they can modify rules and I think in a hard situation where they were caught on the horns of a dilemma, the Court has the plenary power to say that although this is not customary with this Court, in this case we want to hear in this case and you can come in without paying this $20.

    Justice Frankfurter I would like to say that your position here, that this is a letter from a clerk and not a judgment is the correct position that this man should go back and do something else and get a judgment first and when I first came into Burns' case in this appeal I had a very similar thought, however, I think we have to concede this fact that this letter from the clerk is in reality and in effect the judgment of the Court. 
    In other words it would be impossible in Ohio for a citizen to file a mandamus action in the Supreme Court without paying $20. 
    It is also impossible and there is a court decision on this in the Wanamaker case, Wanamaker versus Miller that counsel for the petitioner has cited, that a petitioner or a plaintiff could not file a mandamus action against the clerk of the Supreme Court in a Court of Appeals. 
    Even though be could file it in forma pauperis in the Court of Appeals it would not lie against the clerk of the Supreme Court. 
    The Wannamaker case spells out fairly firmly.

    Your Honor --
speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="1977.532" stopTime="1978.493">
    Justice William O. Douglas 
    It seems to be in the briefs.
speaker="harry_c_schoettmer" startTime="1978.493" stopTime="2036.536">
    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    160, it's on page ten of petitioner's brief in the note, 164 Ohio State 174. 
    Here is the case in question, and I think we have to face up to it. 
    As Your Honor pointed out this is a unique case, we have no record to go back to, we have no law as such except the Griffin, there is no long line of thought on this issue, but I think we can say this, that in the first instance we should concede therefore that the letter of the clerk of the Supreme Court is in effect the judgment of the Ohio Supreme Court, and I say that because in my interpretation of Wannamaker case, there were certain -- there was this mandamus action brought against the clerk of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court members all stepped down and Court of Appeals members stepped up and made the decision in the Wannamaker case.
speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="2036.536" stopTime="2047.915">
    Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. 
    May I ask the fact, the fact you are telling us that Ohio concedes for the purpose of this case, this Court may treat the letter as the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio.
speaker="harry_c_schoettmer" startTime="2047.915" stopTime="2056.087">
    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    I think in effect in the law of the Supreme Court of Ohio that that has to be accepted Your Honor, even though we would love --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2056.087" stopTime="2065.159">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    That is not binding -- I want to ask -- that is binding on us. 
    We have held again and again what the state court thinks of a judgment is not in our view necessarily of a judgment.
speaker="harry_c_schoettmer" startTime="2065.159" stopTime="2166.762">
    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    Well, it is a unique position for that reason. 
    Our second point that I think we should concede here in this Burns case is it without the payment of $20 by Burns that no papers could be filed in the Supreme Court and therefore he could not file under the law his motion for leave to appeal. 
    Now Your Honor you mentioned before, so how he could possibly get into court? 
    Suppose the Supreme Court wanted to hear a case that was in the Court of Appeals, and how could it get to the court? 
    Has there ever been a circumstance where the Supreme Court has ordered a case that had been heard in the Court of Appeals into its court? 
    That if Ohio does have that procedure, the Supreme Court can order a decision of the Court of Appeals certified to it. 
    At this stage of our history in Ohio we have not had the position in such a circumstance that the party could not pay the $20. 
    Without question in my opinion, if that did happen, if that were true in Burns, without question if the Supreme Court said we want to hear that case from a first district appellate court bring it up here, if Burns comes in and says well Your Honor I don't have $20, I am confident that the Supreme Court of Ohio would say we'll waive the $20 without any question in my mind that the Supreme Court would not (Inaudible) its own order because of its rule of $20.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2166.762" stopTime="2198.575">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    That wasn't exactly the question I ask. 
    I assumed of course that the Court could waive its own rule if it wanted to do it, but my question was, were there any cases where the defendant was the one who wanted to have a hearing in the Supreme Court and where the Supreme Court gave him that relief even though he could not pay the $20.
speaker="harry_c_schoettmer" startTime="2198.575" stopTime="2199.451">
    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    Not that I know of.
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2199.451" stopTime="2206.466">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Yes well that's my only question. 
    I can see the other very, very plainly, but this a little different, you must --
speaker="harry_c_schoettmer" startTime="2206.466" stopTime="2260.094">
    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    On that question, but this just establishes our point that much harder and that is this. 
    In the light of the concessions that we have made here, these two points, we feel that and we request that it be conceded that a court, the Supreme Court of Ohio, this Court, any court has a right to determine the conditions precedent to the procedure to be followed in perfecting an appeal to that court, as long as they are reasonable. 
    Now when they are unreasonable, when they are completely out of hand without question, the Court maybe infringing on somebody's rights, but as long as these conditions precedent are reasonable, we feel that without question any court can say what a man has to do in order to perfect an appeal to that court, why?
speaker="earl_warren" startTime="2260.094" stopTime="2267.762">
    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    Even though it denies to an indigent person a right that a person with money could have?
speaker="harry_c_schoettmer" startTime="2267.762" stopTime="2299.592">
    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    You Honor I don't know why it's so necessary to say that money is such a separate and distinct type of condition precedent to any other type of condition that might be put forth. 
    Any number of things a court can say that it has to be done by the defendant or by the appellant in order to get in. 
    Now why we should select money as some significant or extra important sensitive condition I just don't understand that.

    Well, I don't think it's invidious or hurtful and I suggest that to Your Honor in the light of my discussion with the Chief Justice in that, in the history of Ohio we've never had that circumstance develop in an appeal, up to this time, up to this man.

    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    The problem -- all right sorry Your Honor, the problem comes out is who has to determine he is a pauper. 
    He signs an affidavit, and I'm sure the law is fairly general concerning men with these criminal records, should we believe them right off, should the state go out and examine what his accounts are --
speaker="felix_frankfurter" startTime="2492.245" stopTime="2536.365">
    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    (Inaudible) very different question, that question comes up all the time in the federal court, and even in this Court. 
    We have applications here asking for relief (Inaudible) and it has (Inaudible) but that isn't the problem in this case is it? 
    Your problem is what Mr. Justice Harlan suggested, that the instances in which make men really want to appeal to your Supreme Court for another review, haven't got the necessary $20, it's so insignificant, so unreal a limitation upon the power of getting hearing from that Court, that the legislature or the judiciary has the right to make that decision.

    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    That's right. 
    Now the question is if a man has an honest appeal, can he somewhere sometime in his course of conduct after his appeal by the appellant court, get $20? 
    We maintain that this $20, if you please as set forth by the Court, is one of those reasons, one of those manners, one of those means that the Court uses to stop frivolous appeals, to stop men who were just -- fought the Court to come in and talk to it.

    In order for -- to avoid or immunize abuse and waste a state may appropriately hedge, not only gives leave for -- about the opportunity to prove a conviction wrong. 
    When a state not only gives leave for appellate correction of trial errors, but must pay for the cost of its exercise by the indigent, it may protect itself so that frivolous appeals are not subsidized and pubic money is not needlessly spent.

    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    Well, because it fellows like Burns Your Honor, remember this is a deputy sheriff.

    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    Well, only because we feel that first of all this man has had his appeal, that the Griffin rule should not be extended, that the Supreme Court of Ohio should have the right to say what are the reasonable necessary procedures and we feel that it is the prerogative of that court to determine its procedural development and we're confident that this Court would say that any reasonable procedure that Supreme Court says it must have is perfectly all right. 
    We're trying to suggest this Court --

    Chief Justice Earl Warren 
    I think no one would disagree with you, if you said that everybody could have but one appeal in the Ohio and that, that stopped right there at the Court of Appeals, but when you prescribe another procedure, above that whereby people who have means can have access to the Supreme Court, but through which indigents can have no access, then it seems to me you've got an entirely different problem.

    Justice Felix Frankfurter 
    I have now read the two Wanamaker cases and it doesn't help me in the slightest with my problem (Inaudible). 
    The first Wanamaker case says that a lower court can't mandamus the clerk of the Supreme Court, and tell that clerk what did you do with reference to matters before that court, (Inaudible). 
    And the second Wanamaker case simply would be the general rule that involved this problem at all, that the clerk has always the duty of seeing that the formal requirements are satisfying and he can't pass on the merits of a mandamus, any connection with that and we should think that it's properly prepared or accompanied by regular filing fee, that doesn't deal with my problem at all whether action could be added to the Court, so that the court when it held to waive its requirement of fee, will respond, and not the clerk in giving the general rule, he is just (Inaudible) in that regard.

    May I ask you on the second one, how did first -- how did Wanamaker there get notice of the Supreme Court has been held for mandamus against the clerk.

    Exhibit B I think shows you did it by (Inaudible). 
    Did they decline, did the Supreme Court decline the issues of mandamus for clerk?

    I think the Court said –

speaker="harry_c_schoettmer" startTime="3123.615" stopTime="3132.277">
    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    Yes and then the Supreme Court stepped aside and reversed it, I believe that was right, isn't that right judge? 
    As I recall the case.
speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="3132.277" stopTime="3138.114">
    Justice Tom C. Clark 
    It came up here to us, that he asked us to reverse their refusal, to give him a mandamus.
speaker="harry_c_schoettmer" startTime="3138.114" stopTime="3197.939">
    Mr. Harry C. Schoettmer 
    Yes he did, I believe he denied it Your Honor. 
    The only point in that case, that I said what I did was this, that I believe the Court goes on to say that the clerk must do whatever the Supreme Court says it must do as a robot, as an (Inaudible). 
    If he accepts the paper incorrectly against the orders of the Court then he should -- the Court will fire him. 
    If he refuses to accept papers, and the Court will have to handle him in its own course as it sees fit because it is -- he is its robot. 
    Now because the clerk turns down the applicant, therefore it is apparently the order of the Court that he do so. 
    That's what I meant Your Honor.

    I don't know whether I ought to get into this view of counsel's concession that the letter of the clerk should be treated as the judgment of the Court. 
    But the Wanamaker case, if they -- that when the clerk carries out the instructions of the Court he is acting for the Court, and in this case the clerk was carrying out the instructions of the Court, the letter say so --

    He simply says this is the regular thing, that you require a filing fee, but the specific problem whether a specific appeal, it then raises the general question whereby a court could say, is it a new problem for us hereafter to indigently establish, he weighs this, was not before the Wanamaker Court and is not to be inferred from the clerk's letter, it is just telling a routine order of (Inaudible)

    Ms. Helen G. Washington 
    Well, the clerk's letter does indicate that the Court has ruled on this question and that he is following that ruling, at least that is my interpretation of it, and I think for practical purposes it has to be treated as the order or the judgment of the Court.

    Mrs. Washington before you sit down I would like to express the appreciation of the Court to you for assuming this responsibility of defending this indigent prisoner. 
    We are always comforted by the fact that members of our bar are willing to do that as a public service and we feel very much indebted to you. 
    And gentlemen may I say that we appreciate the prudent manner in which you have represented the State of Ohio and also for your very extreme frankness that you have displayed in this case and that of course without regard to decision in this case, very well.
