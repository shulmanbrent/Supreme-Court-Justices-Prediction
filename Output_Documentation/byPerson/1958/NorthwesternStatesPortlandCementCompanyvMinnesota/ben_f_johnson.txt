mr.
ben
f.
johnson
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
might
help
to
start
here
with
the
nature
of
the
georgia
tax.
the
georgia
tax
is
a
--
the
georgia
income
tax
act
of
1931
as
amended
and
the
georgia
statute
says
that
the
taxes,
the
tax
on
net
income,
i'd
like
to
read
you
the
precise
language
of
the
statute
if
i
may.
the
first
section
is
the
tax
on
individuals.
a
tax
is
hereby,
now
this
is
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief
page
57,
a
tax
on
individuals,
a
tax
is
hereby
imposed
upon
every
resident
in
this
state.
the
tax
can
levied
and
collected
and
paid
annually
with
respect
to
the
entire
net
income
of
the
taxpayer's
(inaudible)
at
the
time
and
upon
having
been
non-resident
with
respect
to
his
entire
income,
not
here
exempted,
received
by
such
taxpayer,
from
a
proxy
owned
or
from
business
cared
on
in
this
state
can
use
its
foreign
rates.
now
then
the
next
section
of
that
statute,
which
is
set
forth
over
on
page
three,
because
it's
more
relevant
to
the
question
here
than
that,
section
92
3102
says
every
domestic
corporation
and
every
foreign
corporation,
shall
pay
annually
an
income
tax,
(inaudible)
to
five
and
one-half
percent
--
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
i'm
reading
now,
i've
just
read
about
individuals.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
page
57
back,
and
now
i'm
back
on
page
three
--
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
--
dealing
with
the
constitutional
provision
in
the
statute
immediately
involved,
so
that
every
domestic
corporation
and
every
foreign
corporation
shall
pay
annually
an
income
tax
equivalent
to
five
and
one-half
percent
of
the
net
income
from
property
owned
or
from
business
done
in
georgia
as
defined
in
section
92-3113.
now
i
simply
observe
at
this
point,
that
we
tax
income
of
residents
and
non-residents,
if
it's
received,
derived
from
property
owned
or
business
done
in
georgia,
and
we
tax
domestic
corporations
and
we
tax
foreign
corporations,
on
the
income
which
is
derived
from
property
owned
or
business
done
in
georgia.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
clear
and
right
to
point,
yes.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
yes,
and
that's
contained,
i'm
getting
to
that
your
honor.
now
then
--
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
i
think
we've
got
to
see
this,
and
that
is
that,
we
may
have
a
corporation
that
is
in
engaged
in
exclusively
interstate
commerce
and
yet
nevertheless,
some
of
its
activities
have
taken
place
locally
within
georgia,
that
is
territorial
within
georgia.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
now
that
is
--
that's
not
local
business
in
the
sense
of
your
franchise
tax,
but
that
is
local
activity,
which
maybe
receiving
benefits
and
protections
and
opportunities
from
the
laws
of
georgia
and
from
the
government
of
georgia
and
the
economy
of
georgia,
which
developed.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
that's
the
way
i
see
it.
in
other
words,
to
answer
in
part
to
your
question,
that
is
when
our
court
said
that
--
they
said
this
is
an
excise
tax,
they
say
just
that,
they
say
it's
in
the
nature
of
an
excise
tax.
but
now
i
say
that
they
were
not
there
giving
a
ruling
or
judgment
of
law
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
but
they
were
there
making
a
rule
constitutional
law,
and
as
such
were
merely
acting
as
an
inferior
court
to
this
court
because
this
is
the
court
that
gives
us
those
judgments
with
regard
to
constitutional
law.
therefore,
when
they
said,
as
in
effect
they
said,
that
an
income
tax
is
a
franchise
tax,
they
were
ruling
not
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
with
regard
to
our
legislature's
intent,
they
were
saying
irrespective
of
legislative
intent,
per
se,
constitutionally
per
se,
that
this
is
a
franchise
tax,
and
that,
when
they
said
that
they
were
operating
just
as
an
inferior
federal
court
and
we
are
now
here
to
get
the
last
authority
ruling
with
regards
to
whether
or
not
an
income
tax
is
per
se
a
franchise
tax.
now
that's
with
regard
to
the
interstate
commerce
question.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
i
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
that's
right.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
now
then
--
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
well
i
though
maybe
if
we
started
with
the
nature
and
see
that
my
statute
is
clear,
they
do
have
that
little
problem
in
that.
now
to
return
to
the
facts
and
these
facts,
we
never
admitted
that
they
were
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce,
we
just
said
that
the
plaintiff
characterized
his
activities
to
engage
and
include,
and
the
georgia
supreme
court
said
so,
and
therefore
we
will
argue
it
that
way.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
yes
sir,
that
--
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
let
me
if
i
may,
see
just
exactly
what
the
trial
judge
did
say
there.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
that's
right,
in
this
regard
and
i
think
i
would
like
to
finish
that
about
that
statute
and
i'll
get
to
those
facts.
and
i
would
like
to
say
this
--
this
other
there
because
it'll
help
us
to
sort
of
bring
this
thing
along.
first
the
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
the
georgia
statute
taxes
the
income
of
domestic
foreign
corporations
alike.
there
is
no
question
of
discrimination
about
it
in
this
case.
they
make
no
claim
of
discrimination.
the
next
thing
i'd
like
to
say,
and
this
is
according
to
our
supreme
court,
the
georgia
statute
purports
to
tax
only
the
income
derived
from
sources
within
the
state,
but
it
has
no
purpose
to
tax
income
from
sources
outside
the
state.
and
in
order
to
do
this
it
sets
up
a
three
fact
formula,
which
is
based
on
inventories,
payroll
and
gross
receipts.
now
that's
not
all
that
might
be
used,
that's
the
statutory
formula
and
the
commissioner
has
authority
to
develop
any
other
formula
that
more
closely
fits
the
particular
facts
of
a
particular
case
in
order
to
bring
about
a
fairer
allocation,
a
fairer,
a
factor
which
more
measure
best
than
these
passed
upon
the
facts
to
fit
the
case.
now
stockham
makes
no
claim
in
this
case
that
–
that
their
formula
which
was
used
in
this
case,
taxed
as
income
which
was
derived
from
sources
outside
of
georgia,
except
with
regard
to
what
was
done
at
the
home
office
there.
now,
let
me
put
that
a
little
bit
different.
we
will
see
in
a
minute
that
this
--
that
these
sale
representatives
in
georgia,
traveling
georgia
and
in
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
and
florida,
and
so
on.
now
they
are
not
saying
at
all
that
we
are
tying
to
tax
income,
derived
from
income
producing
efforts
in
north
carolina
or
south
carolina
or
florida.
they
do
of
course
say
that
we
are
trying
to
tax
income
which
is
derived
in
alabama,
because
that's
where
the
home
office
is,
and
that's
where
these
contracts
are
accepted
and
the
credit
and
so
on,
we
will
get
back
to
that.
in
1950,
our
income
tax
statute
was
amended
to
add
this.
every
such
corporation,
that's
in
with
respect
of
foreign
domestic
corporations,
that's
right
in
behind
that
section,
shall
be
deemed
to
be
doing
business
within
the
state
that
engages
within
that
state
in
any
activities
or
transactions
for
the
purpose
of
financial
profit
or
gain,
whether
or
not,
such
corporation
qualifies
to
do
business
in
this
state,
whether
or
not
it
maintains
an
office
or
place
of
doing
business
within
a
state,
and
whether
or
not
such
activity
or
transaction
is
connected
with
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
now
that
amendment,
part
of
that
amendment,
the
georgia
court
had
held,
that
our
statute
did
not
intend,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
did
not
intend
to
tax
income
derived
from
exclusively
interstate
commerce,
but
from
sources
or
activities
in
georgia.
so
the
purpose
of
this
amendment
is
to
exhaust
the
state's
constitutional
power
to
tax
income
from
georgia
sources,
including
income
from
exclusively
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
which
is
carried
on
within
the
state.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
yes
i
think
it
was,
i'm
not
too
conversant
with
it.
now
then,
let
me
go
back
to
the
facts
in
our
case.
this
was
a
delaware
corporation.
its
main
office
was
in
birmingham.
its
factory,
it's
only
manufacturing
plant
was
in
birmingham.
it
had
an
established
scheme
of
distribution
and
that's
scheme
was
this,
in
four
cities,
other
than
birmingham,
it
had
warehouses
and
another
seven
--
these
of
course
were
strategically
located
all
over
the
united
states,
in
another
seven
cities
strategically
located
over
the
united
states,
they
had
what
are
called
sales,
service
offices.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
offices,
yes
offices.
now
then,
i
want
to
put
this
in,
all
orders
which
were
received
or
accepted
at
the
home
office
in
birmingham,
and
all
shipments
were
remade
fob
warehouse.
now
then,
i
want
to
point
out
the
differences
in
the
northwestern
case,
in
so
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
and
then
i'll
--
because
that's
fresh
in
mind
and
i
--
there
are
three
main
differences
here,
between
our
case,
start
from
the
statute,
on
the
facts
there
are
three
main
differences.
first
is
that
northwestern
had
two
salesmen
and
a
secretary
which
was
operating
out
of
its
minneapolis
--
which
was
operating
in,
i
should
say
and
in
and
out
i
guess
out
of
its
minneapolis
office.
and
there
were
one
to
three
owners
that
were
operating
in
the
state
of
minnesota
but
not
operating
out
of
this
office,
they
were
operating
of
their
home
that's
in
northwestern.
our
case
we
had
--
they
had
only
one
full
time
sales
service
representative
that
was
stationed
so
to
speak
in
this
atlanta
office
and
then
they
had
a
full
time
secretary
there
and
that's
--
a
difference
in
personnel.
they
had
more
personnel
there
than
we
did.
second
is
that
their
--
these
operators,
salesmen
whatever
you
call
them,
were
confined
to
minnesota
whereas
the
sales
service
representative
in
georgia
also
traveled
in
some
in
the
surrounding
states
and
the
record
shows
that
that
in
this
he
spent
about
two-third
of
his
time
traveling
to
these
other
states
and
about
one-third
of
his
time
in
the
atlanta
office.
the
third
difference
is
the
volume
of
business,
the
volume
of
business
which
northwestern
got
out
of
minnesota
went
up
to
48%
of
its
total
sales,
but
in
our
case
it
was
only
1%
to
2%,
but
in
dollar
terms
that
was
a
$150,000
to
$300,000
worth
of
business.
now
then
as
regards
to
due
process,
because
i
have
got
to
show
in
order
to
win
this
case,
i
have
got
to
show
that
these
activities,
i
won't
call
them
local
activities,
these
activities
that
took
place
in
georgia,
even
though
they
were
wholly
pursuant
to
interstate
commerce,
i
have
go
to
show
that
they
were
substantially
enough
to
have
received
some
of
the
opportunities
and
the
benefits
and
the
protections
of
the
state
of
georgia.
now
then
let
me
--
i'll
say
that
that
these
differences
that
i
have
given
you
are
really
not
material
differences,
because
we
think
it
is
the
quality
of
what
stockham
was
doing,
the
quality
of
stockham's
establishment
in
georgia
and
not
the
measurable
aspects
of
it.
i
can
illustrate
that
pretty
simple,
from
the
northwestern's
case
if
you
notice
that
one
year
they
only
have
$10
tax
and
for
the
10
--
this
is
northwestern,
$10
tax
and
for
the
preceding
10
years
that
tax
had
run
up
to
$8000
and
for
five
years
after
that
it
again
went
up
to
$7000
or
$8000.
i
don't
know
why
that
happened,
but
it
could
have
happened
because
they
didn't
have
much
sales,
but
the
record
shows
that
its
establishment
was
the
same
all
during
that
time.
now
you
could
take
another
illustration
as
i
pointed
out,
stockham
we
have
three
years
involved
here.
the
first
year
they
had
about
a
$150,000
of
sales,
the
third
year
they
had
$300,000
which
was
about
double.
if
it's
a
quantitative
thing
at
what
point,
and
we
are
talking
about
jurisdiction
to
tax,
at
what
point
does
jurisdiction
of
tax
if
it's
a
quantitative
thing.
so
i
say
it's
a
qualitative
thing.
now
i
like
to
say
a
bit
about
what
we
are
not
talking
about.
$300,000
of
sales
can
be
gotten
out
of
georgia
on
a
number
of
different
ways.
they
could
have
gotten
$300,000
of
sales
out
of
georgia
by
mail
order
business
and
we
are
not
talking
about
mail
order
business.
they
could
have
had
an
occasional
traveling
salesman,
go
through
there,
and
he
may
have
been
a
good
salesman
and
gotten
$300,000
worth
of
business
and
we
are
not
talking
about
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
may
have
had
a
proof
of
these
traveling
salesmen
operating
out
of
birmingham
and
getting
in
there
fairly
regularly,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
that.
they
may
have
even
had
an
office
in
atlanta,
and
this
crew
of
traveling
salesman
may
have
used
that
office
as
a
sort
of
mail
drop,
but
we
are
not
talking
about
that.
so
the
question
is
what
is
the
quality
of
stockham's
establishment
in
atlanta?
now
when
we
speak
to
this,
i
think
we
are
looking
at
the
nature
of
what
went
on
there.
it's
substance
that
causal
relationship
between
the
activities
that
went
on
there
and
in
these
seven
other
places
and
the
relationship
of
all
of
that
is
total
activities.
and
i
might
say
here
that
we
are
not
talking
about
how
stockham
might
have
acted,
i
mean
how
close
it
might
have
acted.
i
mean,
instead
of
being
expansive,
it
could
have
acted
--
stayed
at
home.
well
we
talk
about
how
they
did
that?
now
it
is
a
fact
in
the
record
the
stockham
had
an
office
in
atlanta
and
this
office
was
publicized
as
the
office,
as
the
atlanta
office
of
stockham.
they
were
listed
in
the
telephone
book.
they
were
listed
in
the
classified
section
under
the
(inaudible)
in
city.
they
were
--
they
sent
out
their
letterheads
and
said
that
they
had
seven
of
these
offices
throughout
the
country
and
atlanta
was
one
of
them
and
it
was
in
all
their
literature.
now
it
was
there
as
a
part
of
a
designed
system
of
distribution,
it
was
there
permanently.
it
was
there
day
to
date.
it
was
there
year
in
year
out
since
1950.
it
was
there,
it
was
not
there
temporarily,
it
was
not
there
transiently.
it
was
there
to
compete
with
its
competitors
as
the
record
says
many
of
whom
had
inventory
stocked
of
these
very
same
goods
in
atlanta.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
i
think
the
sum
total,
the
sum
quality
of
it,
i
wouldn't
say
that
one
factor
--
i
would
say
this,
that
if
they
did
have
inventory
there
then
that
is
an
establishment
of
considerable
quality
because
you
get
over
when
you
peddle
it,
cases
there
almost
--
you
see
you
are
better.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
no
sir.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
but
their
competitors
did.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
not
but
they
had
a
--
they
had
all
the
catalogues,
the
literature.
they
had
a
secretary
there
who
was
in
teletype
communication
with
birmingham.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
but
it's
enlarged,
--
that
concept
of
doing
business
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
think
if
your
trade
it
all
the
way
the
back,
it
always
has
been
in
connection
in
due
process
and
not
in
connection
with
interstate
commerce.
what
i
am
saying
is
that,
it
was
there
to
compete
with
competitors
who
were
on
the
spot
with
their
goods.
it
was
there
purposefully
to
get
business.
it
was
there
with
sufficient
personnel
to
get
the
business
and
they
wanted
to
get
all
the
business
they
could
get
and
they
want
to
get
in
anyway
they
could
get
it.
now
let's
see
it
another
way;
stockham
had
no
hold
on
its
market
through
patterns
on
its
products.
it
had
no
hold
on
its
market
through
national
advertising.
it
had
no
hold
on
these
local
wholesalers
and
jobbers
by
reason
of
exclusive
dealership
arrangement.
its
product
was
a
standard
and
common
design,
manufactured
and
sold
by
a
number
of
competitors.
some
of
them
as
i
said,
had
warehouse
stocked
right
there
in
atlanta.
its
customers
were
independent
wholesalers,
independent
wholesalers
and
jobbers
who
were
free
to
buy
or
not
to
buy,
to
stock
these
goods
or
not
to
stock
them,
to
push
or
not
to
push
them.
they
were
free
to
deal
in
competitive
products
and
the
record
shows
that
their
customers
did
carry
one
or
more
competing
lines
of
the
identical
partners.
the
record
also
shows
that
stockham
did
not
seek
to
compete
by
price
cut.
now
that's
what
i
call
a
competitive
and
fluid,
if
you
get
what
i
mean,
it
was
a
fluid
condition,
a
fluid
market
condition.
they
could
get
what
business
because
they
owned
the
spot
at
the
right
time
to
get
it
or
it
going
somewhere
else,
that's
what
i
mean
by
fluid,
sort
of
quick
(inaudible).
you
couldn't
fetch
a
thing
on
it
unless
you
were
right
there,
at
the
right
time
with
the
right
kind
of
search
because
if
you
weren't,
it
was
going
next
door.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that,
no.
i
am
not
trying
to
draw
in
an
analogy
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
i
said
that
on
the
facts
other
than
those
three
things
and
our
name
they
were
pretty
much
like.
now
then
what
was
stockham's
response
to
this
competitive
condition?
the
stipulation
tells,
it
said
while
not
disregarding
price
as
a
factor
stockham
sought
in
this
competition
to
emphasize
on
the
quality
of
its
goods.
now
this
local
establishment
didn't
have
a
thing
in
the
world
to
do
with
the
quality
of
its
goods,
but
it
did
have
a
function
with
regard
to
emphasizing
first
hand,
face-to-face
to
these
customers
of
theirs
just
what
do
you
mean
by
quality
pipe
fittings.
second,
and
the
stipulation
goes
on,
stockham
saw
in
this
competition
to
emphasize
its
good
service
to
local
wholesalers
and
jobbers.
now
this
good
service
is
spelled
further
on
in
the
stipulation.
these
--
and
in
some
detail,
i
hesitate
to
repeat,
but
it
is
fell
out
in
considerable
detail
what
they
were
there
to
do
with
regard
to
their
customers
and
with
regard
to
prospective
customers.
they
were
not
at
all
instruments
of
emphasizing
their
good
service
and
selling
their
good
service
but
they
were
instruments
of
furnishing
the
service.
they
owned
the
stock.
they
were
in
direct
communication,
teletype
communication
with
birmingham.
they
could
get
those
goods
into
atlanta
overnight
by
teletype
and
as
almost
as
quickly
as
you
could
get
them
delivered
from
the
competitor
down
the
street
with
a
stock
of
goods
in
atlanta,
they
could
get
these
goods
out
of
birmingham
overnight,
promise
to
deliver
in
the
morning,
because
they
had
a
man
on
the
job
right
down
the
spot,
they
would
expedite
this
thing,
get
it
through
and
give
these
customers
that
good
service
that
customers
appreciate
in
tight
place.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
yes
sir
i'm
--
it's
all
interstate
commerce,
it's
all
interstate
commerce,
i
am
trying
to
show
you
that
they
had
a
--
in
quantity
they
had
a
substantial
establishment
there,
quantity
to
note,
but
in
the
production
of
its
income
it
was
all
in
force.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
sir?
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
that's
what
i
am
saying
qualitative.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
that's
right.
now
then
the
stipulation
goes
on.
it
says
stockham
sought
in
this
competition
to
emphasize
a
third
kind,
the
development
of
a
local
demand
for
stockham
products
through
sales
work
among
local
architects,
engineers,
contractors,
and
others
consulted
and
in
a
position
to
advise
concerning
the
specifying
the
use
of
5000
biddings
including
representatives
of
governmental
and
industrial
use.
now
this
business
of
development
a
local
demand,
these
local
representatives
were
the
chief
actors.
they
could
talk
the
technical
language
of
architect
and
engineers
and
this
is
in
the
record
and
they
could
advise
with
them
and
pass
on
technical
ideas.
after
all
it's
the
architect
who
writes
up
the
specification
and
can
specify
stockham
products
and
therefore
can
control
the
products,
which
is
going
in
to
these
businesses.
now
it
was
also
important
that
these
wholesalers
and
jobbers
know
that
this
man
was
doing
this
local
development,
because
every
local
wholesaler
likes
to
know
that
his
manufacturer
is
out
selling
his
goods
for
him
and
preparing
the
market
in
preparing
demand.
so
that
was
the
third
function
which
these
local
representatives
were
doing.
they
were
going
out
there
and
building
up
a
local
demand
than
going
to
the
local
wholesaler
and
say
look
what
we
do
employ,
not
taking
orders
that's
what
was
involved
in
the
northwest
solidly,
they
weren't
taking
any
orders.
if
they
got
any
orders,
they
would
simply
relay
them
into
birmingham.
if
they
got
a
local
architect
who
wanted
the
product,
he
would
reaffirm
to
a
local
wholesaler
or
jobber.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
i
wouldn't
say
that
any
one
of
these
factors
all
by
itself
established
a
quality
--
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
no
sir.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
thank
you.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
in
the
15
minutes
that
i
have
left,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
question
on
the
relationship
between
a
general
net
income
tax
and
exclusively
interstate
commerce.
and
first
i'd
like
to
say
this,
by
way
of
further
description
of
our
georgia
income
tax
and
i
think
it
can
be
best
said
very
succinctly
by
saying
that
it's
an
income
tax
just
like
the
federal
income
tax.
the
second
thing
that
i
think
needs
to
be
said
at
this
point
is
that
with
respect
to
attack
on
interstate
commerce,
that
this
court
has
many
times
said,
that
the
fact
that
an
interstate
operator
has
to
pay
the
tax,
does
not
determine
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax.
our
concern
then
is
to
see
if
somehow
or
another,
a
general
income
tax,
or
general
net
income
tax
like
the
georgia
tax,
is
a
tax
on
interstate
operations
as
distinguished
from
an
interstate
operator.
now
i
suggest
that
there
are
two
propositions
of
law
that
we've
got
to
take
into
consideration.
the
first
is
a
formalistic
judgment
of
this
court
that
a
tax
which
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
is
determined
to
be
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
business
as
a
part
to
the
exclusively
interstate
commerce
is
invalid,
no
matter
how
its
nature.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
no
sir,
i
don't
mean
that.
i
mean
that's
it's
--
i
don't
mean
that.
i
mean
that
we
look
to
see
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
and
if
the
legislature
says
it's
a
privilege
tax
then
this
court
goes
no
further,
when
it's
a
part
to
interstate
--
to
exclusively
interstate
and
commerce,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
fairly
that
tax
is
measured.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
yes
sir,
i
am
--
all
i
want
to
say
is
--
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
no
sir.
i
don't
want
to
use
that
word
nominally,
because
that
to
me
is
emptiness
in
another
direction
if
you
get
what
i
mean.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is,
what
was
held
in
the
spector
case.
now
then,
i
say
that
in
this
case,
we
are
not
concerned
with
such
a
tax
as
that,
because
our
statute
called
it
an
income
tax.
you
can
read
the
provisions
of
it
and
it's
an
income
tax,
just
like
the
federal
income
tax.
our
supreme
court
did
not
say
that
it
was
not
an
income
tax
and
i
don't
really
believe
that
the
respondents
contend
that
it
is
not
an
income
tax.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
i
have
no
objection
to
those
conclusions.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
the
second
proposition
that
i'm
trying
to
bring
in
here
is
this,
to
get
to
the
substance
of
the
matter,
and
this
is
really,
you
are
ahead
of
me,
it
is
that
--
a
tax
upon
business
activity,
when
that
business
activity
is
exclusively
interstate
commerce,
is
a
tax
upon
interstate
commerce
or
activity,
no
matter
what
the
name
of
the
tax
is.
i
said
that
first
proposition
we
are
not
convinced
this
is
the
proposition
that
we
are
concerned
with.
now
the
clearest
manifestation
of
this
proposition
is
found
in
the
tax
on
gross
receipts.
a
tax
own
gross
receipts,
no
matter
what
the
name
of
the
tax
is,
is
a
tax
on
the
business
activity
which
produced
those
gross
receipts,
and
when
that
activity
is
exclusively
interstate
commerce,
it's
a
tax
on
interstate
activity.
why,
because
gross
receipt
is
business
activity
reduced
to
its
money
equivalent.
activity
is
one
side
of
the
coin
and
gross
receipts
is
the
other
side
of
the
corner.
in
other
words
gross
receipt
is
a
direct
reflection
of
activity.
now
the
next
manifestation
of
this
proposition
is
found
in
the
tax
on
gross
income.
the
indiana
gross
income
tax
that
was
involved
in
the
adams
manufacturing
company
case
(inaudible)
and
in
these
cases
the
court
concluded
the
gross
income
was
like
gross
receipts,
and
that
it
was
pretty
much
a
direct
reflection
of
the
activity
which
produced
the
gross
income.
so
the
question
in
the
present
case
it
seems
to
me
is
whether
or
not
the
law
with
respect
to
gross
receipts
taxes
and
gross
income
taxes
is
going
to
develop
and
cover
the
net
income
tax.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
not
on
gross
receipts.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
well
sir
it
depends,
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
net
receipts.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
all
right,
net
income,
yes.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
yes
sir.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
yes
sir.
now
i
would
like
to
answer
this
question
that
i
posed
by
saying
that
all
this
development
need
move
no
further,
the
gross
receipts,
the
gross
income,
that
it
need
not
move
on
to
net
income.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
i
think
that
you
are
getting
me
into
the
due
process
question
again
[attempt
to
laughter]
and
i
conceive
that
there
is
a
place
in
here
where
those
two
things
come
together
and
i'll
try
to
get
to
that
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
work
this
out
a
little
bit
further.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
that
is
my
proposition,
yes.
we
say
--
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
that's
my
business.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
i
do
not
have
to
disagree
with
you
in
order
to
make
out
my
case
i
don't
believe.
now
my
three
reasons
for
my
position,
the
first,
and
i
simply
say
this
to
pass
on,
first
that
we
say
that
there
is
precedent.
we
say
that
this
is
precedent
in
us
glue
company
case,
and
in
the
west
publishing
company
case.
now
of
course
there
is
disagreement
about
that,
but
i
simply
say
that
we
say
that
those
cases
are
precedents.
now
then
i
go
on
to
say
as
my
second
reason
that
this
court
as
a
proposition
of
law
basic
to
both
state
and
federal
income
taxation
as
held
in
other
cases
involving
constitutionally
protected
activities
that
a
tax
on
net
income
is
not
a
tax
on
the
activity
which
is
a
source
of
that
income.
exporting
for
example
with
regard
to
the
federal
tax
is
a
protected
activity.
now
this
court
held
in
peck
&
co.
versus
lowe,
1918,
just
immediately
preceding
us
glue,
that
a
tax
on
the
net
income,
this
was
the
federal
net
income
tax,
that
the
federal
net
income
tax
applied
to
the
income
derived
from
exporting
was
not
a
tax
on
exports,
although,
and
this
is
important,
it
had
previously
held
in
the
case
of
brown
versus
maryland,
that
a
business
activity
tax
or
a
business
privilege
tax
on
the
business
of
exporting
was
a
tax
on
exports.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
that's
correct
sir.
that
is
right
sir.
now
then
my
third
proposition,
and
this
i
think
gets
down
to
what
is
--
is
to
say
this
that
the
decisions
of
these
--
this
court
in
these
cases
is
soundly
based
on
a
judicial
recognition
that
the
incidence
or
the
nature
of
a
net
income
tax
is
something
considerably
removed
from
a
mere
representation
of
the
activity
which
produced
that
income.
now
we
can
examine
this
proposition
in
two
ways.
first,
we
can
examine
it
analytically,
and
second
we
can
examine
it
from
on
a
social
outlook.
analytically
a
net
income
tax
maybe
a
tax
on
residency,
but
when
the
statute
applies
the
tax
to
non-residents,
and
foreign
corporation
as
to
income
earned
within
the
state
or
for
example
when
the
federal
income
tax
taxes
the
income
of
a
non-resident
alien,
which
is
derived
from
the
sources
in
the
united
states,
we
have
to
conclude
that
this
is
at
least
something
more
than
a
tax
on
residents.
analytically
a
net
income
tax,
maybe
a
tax
on
profit,
but
when
the
statute
applies
the
tax
to
business
activity,
it's
obvious
that
it
is
something
more
than
a
tax
on
property.
so
it
comes
to
say
third
analytically
a
net
income
tax
maybe
a
tax
on
business
activity,
and
that
of
course
is
the
respondent's
contention
in
this
case.
so
that
the
–
the
question
becomes
this,
analytically
as
a
general
net
income
tax
like
the
georgia
tax
and
the
federal
tax
for
that
matter,
is
it
a
direct
representation
of
business
activity
and
nothing
more,
the
other
side
of
the
coin
and
if
it
is
the
respondent
is
right,
and
we're
wrong,
but
if
the
nature
of
taxable
income
includes
income
which
does
not
represent
business
activity,
and
if
in
the
various
deductions,
there
are
reducing
factors
which
stand
in
no
relation
whatever
to
economic
activity,
then
obviously
the
tax
is
on
something
other
than
business
activity.
now
i
can't
describe
in
a
word
or
a
paragraph
or
a
label.
pardon
me
please
now.
mr.
ben
f.
johnson
i
can't
describe
it,
in
a
word
or
a
paragraph,
professor
mcgill
wrote
a
whole
book
on
it
and
that
of
course
is
our
difficulty.
we
have
a
growing
concept,
a
developing
concept
here
that
is
we
just
don't
have
the
capacity
to
define
it.
