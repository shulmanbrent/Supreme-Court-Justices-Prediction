justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
go
on
may
i
ask
this,
(inaudible)
you
said
that
section
2
is
invalid
in
its
entirety
and
not
because
of
its
application
to
the
particular
fact
of
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
because
insofar
as
i
understood
you
to
say,
insofar
as
minnesota
has
power
to
levy
a
tax
on
the
doings
of
a
corporation
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
it
would
fall
under
the
--
it
would
be
--
it's
an
incident
imposed
by
section
1,
and
the
circumstances
of
the
section
2
never
can
be
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wanted
to
know
if
is
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
to
levy
the
tax
on
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
troubled
about
this
petition
merely
out
of
respect
for
the
decision
of
supreme
court
of
minnesota.
there
is
no
sanction
behind
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
all
depends
whether
there
was
--
in
iowa
with
respect
to
judgment,
it
ought
to
be
respected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
you
shouldn't.
i
just
want
to
--
the
question
put
my
brother
douglas
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wonder
why
you
get
at
the
commerce
clause
by
the
indirection
of
due
process
clause.
you
said
two
minutes
ago
the
only
thing
that
would
just
effect
is
interstate
commerce
and
you
also
indicated
they
couldn't
pass
on
interstate
commerce,
so
why
isn't
that
the
way
to
get
out
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
minnesota
jurisdiction
because
it
attaches
to
commerce.
it
has
jurisdiction
for
certain
purposes
as
you
agree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
jurisdiction
under
the
international
shoe
case
for
certain
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
does
have
jurisdiction
in
any
sense,
it
could
have
any
meaning
because
it
tackles
up
and
it
doesn't
belong
to
it
i.e.
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
does
this
tax
amount
in
dollars
and
cents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
year,
a
year?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
are
--
are
you
arguing
that
minnesota
can't
pass
a
statute
which
says
the
corporation
that
does
no
local
business
in
minnesota
would
then
(inaudible)
to
get
interstate
sales
shall
pay
each
year
$5000,
could
minnesota
pass
such
a
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
this,
is
this
the
thing,
i
shall
argue
that's
what
they've
done
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
have
to
argue
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
cite
the
cheney
brothers'
case
as
sustaining
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
–
if
you
would
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
facts
in
the
cheney
brothers
case
are
like
the
facts
in
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
understand
the
general
proposition
better.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
they
were
the
same
circumstances.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
local
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
solicited
from
local
buyers
and
turned
the
purchases
or
the
orders
over
to
a
local
wholesaler.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
whom
they
had
served,
no
doubt.
now
what
is
there
analogous
to
that
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
anything
in
this
record
with
which
i
am
not
familiar
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
analogous
to
the
northwestern
case
whereby
in
minnesota
a
retail
customer
was
solicited
for
his
business
and
then
this
corporation,
called
the
northwestern
states
portland
company,
turned
the
order
over
to
a
local
minnesota
resident
wholesaler
to
fill
it,
what
is
there
in
this
record?
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page

justice
felix
frankfurter
336.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
(inaudible)
the
future
by
telling
you
what
that
transcend
says?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
your
answer
to
justice
whittaker
to
be
that
the
qualification
of
section
3
(b
(a)
--
3b,
parenthetically
shall
apply
in
cases
so
on
so
to
any
taxable
year
to
just
exclusively
of
interstate
commerce,
that
that
qualification
consists
of
exclusively
of
interstate
commerce,
does
not
qualify
the
taxability
of
subject
matter
under
b
but
all
you
have
to
look
at
is
under
a,
is
it
net
income.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
taxes
imposed
on
human
beings,
they
are
not
imposed
on
things,
some
individuality
is
tax
that
putting
aside
admiralty
conception.
so
the
section
3
(b)
defined
the
category
of
the
classes
of
taxable
persons,
and
as
i
understand
you
in
reply
to
justice
whittaker
when
he
finds
out
that
the
qualification
under
a
the
others
not
in
country,
not
an
issue
out
of
a
state
trust
and
so
on
that
that
qualification
is
immaterial
so
long
as
you
go
up
and
see
under
a
that
is
net
income.
that's
you
answer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
a
question
of
discrimination.
it's
a
question
of
legislature
having
said
you
can
tax,
having
an
effectible
3
(a)
define
the
scope
of
the
taxing
measure,
you
then
have
a
separate
clause.
i
can
write
it,
the
legislature
of
minnesota
did.
it
has
a
separate
one
fairly
relating
to
people
both
domestic
and
foreign
and
business
within
the
year
et
cetera,
exclusively
intrastate
commerce
and
you
say
that
that
qualification
is
not
a
limitation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
source
is
exclusively
interstate
commerce
then
a
question
arises
that
it's
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
determine,
namely,
whether
they're
levying
upon
the
product
of
interstate
commerce
beyond
the
power
of
state
to
levy
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
correct,
those
railroad
apportionment
cases
are
cases
in
which
the
statute
explicitly
taxed
it,
the
apportioned
value
of
the
corpus
of
the
organic
railroad
within
a
particular
state
for
the
reason
that
is
indicated
that
after
all
that
has
such
a
permanent
situs
within
the
state,
that
it
would
be
unfair
not
to
allow
the
state
to
levy
or
rather
the
other
way
around
it's
not
such
an
intrusion
or
such
an
burden
on
interstate
commerce
as
to
exclude
the
state,
that's
the
theory,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
the
state
supreme
court
may
rewrite
a
tax
statute
to
accomplish
the
result
that
a
good
statute
could
have
accomplished
(inaudible)
business
to
take
the
rewriting
and
not
the
words
of
the
statute,
is
that
what
you
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
talk
as
though
net
income
is
an
abstraction,
net
income
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
be
a
relation
between
the
apportioned
net
income
in
interstate
commerce
and
what
may
fairly
be
localized
as
local
activity
in
relation
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
how
can
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
don't
care
about
either
of
those
labels,
they
mean
nothing
to
me
except
to
confuse
thoughts,
but
when
you
agree
to
justice
whitaker's
remark
and
repeated
it
that
you
agree
this
arises
exclusively
out
of
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
exclusive
then
it
can
have
a
segregateable
local
incidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this,
could
you
--
could
minnesota,
without
any
question
of
construction
of
a
statute,
that's
for
your
cause
and
not
for
us,
could
minnesota
have
taxed,
imposed
a
license
tax
on
these
drummers
soliciting
business
in
minnesota
to
be
filled
by
the
iowa
corporation
from
iowa.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
these
drummers
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
do
the
same
thing
by
calling
the
product
of
their
drumming
local
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what,
in
what
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can
impose,
according
to
our
decisions
it
can
impose
on
the
drummer
who
solicits
this
business
in
minnesota,
a
$10
license
or
a
$50
license,
that
fee
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
it
can
impose
income
tax
on
the
value
of
the
order
which
he
gets,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
with
chief
justice's
permission
be
good
enough
to
put
on
a
piece
of
paper,
or
paint
your
pages
but
not
the
exact
parallel
on
this
record,
or
the
close
enough
parallel,
on
this
record,
of
the
fact
between
this
case
and
northwestern
consolidated
milling
company
case,
because
if
this
is
consolidated
northwestern
milling
company
case,
then
i
for
one
have
those
problems.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general
don't
bother
arguing
it
just
if
you
could,
the
circumstances
--
you
know
what
the
question
justice
black
has
put
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
local
conduct,
so
that's
in
way
the
essence
of
northwestern
milling
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
has
it
received
here
from
minnesota?
the
right
of
its
drummers
to
go
about
and
have
orders
placed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
who,
for
the
drummers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
gather
drummers,
be
likely
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
that
if
the
license
fee
was
enormous,
but
these
are
small
license
fees,
these
aren't
vast
license
fees
and
we
strictly
haven't
done
except
in
the
union
brokerage
case
where
we
worked
hard
to
work
out
some
special
relations
in
the
particular
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
give
me
reference
to
the
record
that's
just
what
i
want.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry
mr.
attorney
general,
what
page
did
you
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
i
read
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon,
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
whatever
one
may
think
about
the
minnesota
case
that
turns
on
the
other
statute
as
different
in
that
section
2
is
just
discussed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
get
to
that
question,
if
i
may,
mr.
attorney
general,
since
the
phrase
is
from
business
done
in
georgia,
what
the
scope
of
that
is
with
due
regard
to
the
commerce
clause
is
a
question
of
each
particular
case,
is
that
right?
in
other
words,
there
is
no
such
trade
exclusivity
in
interstate
commerce
or
so
on
or
domestic.
there
is
a
generalized
trade,
business
done
in
georgia
and
whether
for
taxing
purposes
or
other
georgia
legislative
purposes,
it
is
"business
done
in
georgia",
involved
with
instruction
not
only
of
your
local
law,
but
of
the
limitations
of
your
local
law
through
the
commerce
clause,
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
let's
say
that
your
supreme
court,
(inaudible),
your
supreme
court
had
said
as
the
matter
of
construct,
we
do
not
think
this
is
business
done
in
georgia,
you
couldn't
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
we
by
any
--
if
it
should
turn
out
that
we
sustain
your
court,
on
it's
view
of
the
cons
--
of
the
federal
--
of
the
commerce
clause,
you
could
go
back
to
your
courts
and
then
they
could
say
what
they
say
under
the
local
statute
(inaudible)
less
of
any
limitation
of
the
us
constitution,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
court
–
did
your
court
in
first
instance
make
a
finding
of
facts
that
they
were
exclusive
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
in
your
case,
in
the
trial
court,
was
there
a
trial
court
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
make
a
finding
that
this
(inaudible)
that
the
---
that
the
activities
and
questions
were
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
have
an
inventory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
did
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yeah
did
they
have
a
storeroom
of
samples.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
and
ibm
–
suppose
(inaudible)
ibm
go
around
your
state
or
any
other
state
and
demonstrate
great
value
of
these
new
electrical
typewriters,
make
no
(inaudible)
but
just
create
a
proper
atmosphere
and
(inaudible)
have
that
wonderful
machine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
said
--
you
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
it's
the
totality
of
it.
now
just
i
can
get
one
thing
more
(inaudible),
the
stipulation
goes
on
to
say
this,
that
stockham
relied
on,
that
stockham
relied
on
the
personnel
efforts
of
its
sales
service
representatives
who
were
stationed
in
these
established
sales
--
they
relied
on
them.
now
that
if
your
honor
pleases
is
a
good
summation
of
the
facts
and
i
suppose
that
we
would
conclude
at
4:30
and
i
just
leave
it,
it'd
be
better
than
starting
with
something
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
formalistic,
what
does
that
mean,
that
it
has
no
--
no
rational
justification,
just
that
a
kind
of
an
empty
formula?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
can't
be
fairly,
if
it's
a
tax
which
the
legislature
itself
says
we
want
to
tax
the
right
to
do
business
in
interstate
commerce.
that
isn't
a
formula,
except
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
formula
in
response
to
a
division
of
authority,
between
the
nation
and
the
state.
is
that
right,
would
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
intend
to
suggest
is
formalistic
has
innuendo
of
emptiness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
take
your
time,
but
these
are
very
difficult
questions
for
anywhere.
would
you
agree
that
one
because
it's
denominated,
a
tax
on
interstate
commerce
may
not
be
found
so
necessarily,
as
well
as
the
converse
because
it's
labeled
an
income
tax,
it
may
not
be
offensive
to
the
commerce
law
that's
construed
today.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
be
true
of
mail
order
business,
seers
roebuck
coming
into
georgia,
their
catalogues
and
then
people
sending
back
to
chicago
orders
under
that
catalog?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
define
--
you
are
so
helpful
if
i
may
so
mr.
johnson,
the
temptation
to
ask
you
a
question
is
very
considerable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
that
it
has
--
that
there
is
due
process
is
satisfied
in
the
mcgee
case,
the
purposes
of
saying
there
is
somebody
there,
there
is
such
a
connection,
that
you
can
subpoena
or
file
a
complaint
or
bring
a
suit,
isn't
that
the
same
kind
of
due
process,
does
it
not,
not
to
be
barred
by
the
commerce
clause
for
purposes
of
taxation,
those
are
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
reason
was
the
difference
between
the
two
is
remoteness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
difficulty
is
the
problem
mr.
johnson.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
a
minute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
it's
well
settled
under
your
decision
that
they
would
not
require
this
kind
of
corporation
--
this
corporation
did
not
require
to
get
a
certificate
from
the
commission
to
do
business,
under
what
circumstances
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
that
come
up
in
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
it
come
up
on
a
tax
question
or
--?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
courts
of
that
opinion,
they
just
said
they
don't
have
to
get
a
certificate
to
do
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
has
held
that
they
did
not
require
get
a
certificate
of
permission
to
do
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
no
fraction
if
this
court
were
to
lift
from
your
court,
