mr.
joseph
a.
maun
mr.
chief
justice,
and
members
of
this
court.
this
case
involves
that
the
validity
of
a
portion
of
the
minnesota
state
income
tax
law
under
the
provisions
of
the
commerce
clause
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
by
this
court
on
january
6th
of
this
year.
the
appellant
here
is
a
cement
manufacturer
with
his
plant
and
place
of
business
at
mason
city,
iowa.
it
maintained
one
sales
office
in
the
state
of
minnesota
which
was
occupied
under
a
lease
and
paid
for
out
of
mason
city.
it
owned
no
real
estate
in
the
state
of
minnesota
and
its
only
personal
property
was
such
as
was
necessary
to
run
the
sales
office,
consisting
of
desk,
two
typewriters
and
some
filing
cabinets.
its
salesmen
had
automobiles
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
the
office
consisted
of
two
small
rooms,
some
material,
advertising
material
and
that
is
all.
during
the
years
which
are
involved
in
this
proceeding
the
appellant
had
at
the
most
six
employees
and
i
say
at
the
most
because
it
extends
over
a
period
of
years.
two
of
these
employees
and
the
secretary
worked
out
of
the
minneapolis
office,
the
rest
of
the
salesmen
worked
out
of
their
homes
throughout
the
state
of
minnesota.
all
employees
were
hired
by
supervisory
personnel
in
mason
city,
iowa
and
no
employee
in
the
state
of
minnesota
had
any
authority
to
hire
or
fire
any
other
employee
or
had
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
fixing
of
wages.
the
minnesota
office
was
used
for
the
forwarding
of
orders
that
customers
sent
in
and
a
place
out
of
which
the
two
salesmen
in
minneapolis
could
work.
these
orders
when
they
came
into
the
minneapolis
office
were
transmitted
directly
to
the
mason
city
office
in
iowa.
credit
extensions
and
collections
were
handled
exclusively
by
the
home
office.
no
salesmen
had
any
authority
to
handle
such
matters.
all
claims
for
adjustment
were
handled
directly
by
the
mason
city
office.
no
employee
in
minnesota
had
any
authority
to
do
that.
all
cement
was
invoiced
and
by
shipped
by
rail
from
the
home
office
at
mason
city
directly
to
the
purchasers
who
were
located
in
the
states
of
iowa,
minnesota,
north
and
south
dakota
and
wisconsin.
price
quotations
were
sent
directly
to
the
customers
from
the
home
office
and
all
changes
in
price
were
authorized
only
by
the
mason
city
office.
prices
were
quoted
at
the
mill
site,
fob
mason
city,
although
the
freight
was
added
for
the
convenience
of
a
customer.
now
minnesota
has
taken
a
position
that
part
of
the
income
earned
by
this
taxpayer
is
taxable
by
minnesota.
upon
northwestern's
refusal
to
file
returns,
the
commissioner
of
taxation
for
the
state
of
minnesota
prepared
the
returns
himself.
he
prepared
them
for
the
years
1933
through
1948.
1933
was
a
year
in
which
minnesota
adopted
its
income
tax
law.
when
the
taxpayer
refused
pay
to
these
taxes
disclosed
by
these
returns,
the
state
of
minnesota
in
1953
commenced
this
action
to
collect
these
taxes.
in
preparing
these
returns,
the
commissioner
of
taxation
used
what
is
known
as
a
three
factor
formula
equally
weighted,
that
is
the
ratio
of
the
taxpayer's
shipments
into
minnesota,
to
its
shipment
replace
or
sales,
the
ratio
of
the
taxpayer's
property
in
minnesota
to
its
property
everywhere,
and
the
ratio
of
its
wages
paid
in
minnesota
to
its
wages
everywhere.
now
the
income
taxes,
interest
and
penalties
which
were
demanded
as
a
taxpayer
and
which
the
trial
court
adjudged
were
payable
for
the
years
in
question
amount
to
somewhat
over
$100,000.
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
in
a
five
to
two
divided
opinion
upheld
the
action
of
the
trial
court.
now
the
minnesota
income
tax
is
what
is
sometime
known
as
a
second
structured
tax,
there
is
two
sections
to
it.
the
first
section
provides
that
an
excise
tax
shall
be
laid
up
on
the
privilege
of
the
domestic
corporations
for
the
privilege
of
existing
as
a
corporation
for
any
part
of
a
year
and
upon
look
--
foreign
corporation
doing
a
local
business.
the
second
section
or
structure
and
that's
the
one
we
are
involved
here
provides
that
there
shall
be
an
annual
tax
laid
up
on
foreign
corporations
doing
an
interstate
or
foreign
business
within
the
state
of
minnesota
or
both.
now,
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
commissioner
of
taxation
for
the
state
of
minnesota,
under
this
particular
act,
provides
flatly
that
the
section
requires
the
imposition
of
a
tax
upon
the
net
income
from
interstate
commerce.
there
is
no
pretense
that
there
is
any
local
activity.
had
there
had
been
any
intrastate
activities,
this
levy
would
have
been
made
under
the
first
structure
of
this
tax,
not
the
second.
both
taxes
are
measured
in
exactly
the
same
manner.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
held
that
the
tax
was
not
an
excise
tax,
it
was
not
a
franchise
tax,
it
was
a
not
a
privilege
tax.
it
said
that
it
was
a
general
income
tax.
it
did
not
indirectly
define
what
it
meant
by
a
general
income
tax.
now
i'll
address
myself
first
perhaps
to
the
due
process
aspect
of
this
matter.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
say
that
this
did
not
involve
either
personal
question
at
all.
it's
invalid
in
its
entirety,
as
a
direct
tax
upon
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
don't
see
how
it
can
ever
satisfied.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
no
it
does
not.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
it's
in
six
states,
i
would
say
that
again
you
get
into
your
honor
of
whether
or
not
you
have
the
same
deduction
and
that
sort
of
thing,
based
on
what
the
minnesota
law
is,
it
wouldn't
be
true,
and
now
wisconsin
we
get
into
there
and
they
don't
permit
a
federal
deduction,
so
we
get
into
different
concepts
of
what
constitutes
income,
but
based
on
the
minnesota
formula
iowa
does
not.
now
first
of
all,
as
we
probably
know
that
due
process
may
have
a
threefold
impact
on
taxes
of
this
nature.
first
we
get
into
the
question
of
what
we
might
call
procedural
due
process
of
whether
there
can
be
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
this
taxpayer.
now
--
and
then
we
get
into
the
question
of
legislative
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
of
the
tax
and
thirdly
assuming
those
two
aspects
ever
are
satisfied,
the
question
of
whether
there
is
due
process
in
the
apportionment
factor.
now
we
believe
that
in
this
case
that
minnesota
does
have
jurisdiction
in
personam
over
this
taxpayer
and
that's
not
the
issue
before
this
court,
i
think
based
on
the
international
shoe
company
case
against
washington
where
it
provided
that
they
needed
only
such
notice
as
will
satisfy
the
requirements
of
substantial
justice,
bearing
fair
play
that
there
is
jurisdiction
as
far
as
procedural
jurisdiction
over
this
taxpayer.
we
contend,
however,
if
minnesota
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter,
so
as
to
able
it
to
impose
a
tax
upon
the
income
of
this
company,
it
would
seem
that
if
minnesota
does
have
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter,
then
probably
we
would
never
reach
the
question
of
whether
this
tax
violates
the
commerce
clause.
although
this
court
has
observed
in
some
of
it's
prior
decisions
that
the
conceptions
of
due
process
in
commerce
clause
is
they
related
to
validity
of
tax
statutes,
sometimes
overlap,
they
are
still
not
identical
and
we
should
sharply
distinguish
them.
it
would
certainly
appear
that
minnesota
has
any
jurisdiction
at
all
to
tax
here
then
it
must
be,
because
it
can
subject
interstate
commerce
itself
to
income
tax
because
that
is
the
only
subject
matter
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
here
the
trial
court
itself
followed
that
the
only
activities
of
this
company
carried
on
within
the
state
of
minnesota
were
an
integral
part
of
interstate
commerce
and
all
of
its
revenues
were
produced
from
interstate
commerce.
now
time
and
time
again,
this
court
has
said
that
the
solicitation
of
orders,
together
with
such
acts
as
maybe
in
furtherance
thereof
does
not
provide
the
local
incidence
of
operation,
which
ables
a
state
to
tax
a
foreign
corporation,
but
should
in
all
other
respects
stays
at
home.
the
reason
for
this
of
course
is
that
solicitation,
is
an
essential
ingredient
of
interstate
commerce
itself,
and
this
fundamental
concept
of
course
was
first
pronounced
by
this
court
in
early
case
of
robbins
against
shelby
county
taxing
district.
in
more
recent
cases
this
question
of
due
process
of
a
state
with
relation
to
other
kinds
of
taxes
has
risen
many
times.
in
miller
bros.,
the
court
will
remember
against
the
state
of
maryland,
this
court
stuck
down
the
maryland
excise
tax
on
the
use,
storage
of
consumptions
of
articles
of
commerce
insofar
as
maryland
attempted
to
impose
the
responsibility
of
perfection.
it
was
in
–
and
there
the
solicitation
part
took
(inaudible)
of
radio
and
newspaper
advertising
and
this
court
there
pointed
out
that
although
its
decisions
were
not
always
clear,
and
to
the
reason
for
the
invalidity
of
these
taxes,
the
principle
remained
that
due
process
always
required
some
definite
link,
some
minimum
connection
between
the
state,
the
person,
the
property
and
the
business,
which
it
sought
to
impose
a
tax
upon.
so
we
may
ask
ourselves
here,
what
local
incidents
are
taxable
events
in
minnesota?
this
company
ships
48%
of
its
product
into
minnesota
and
certainly
if
that
fact
is
to
become
a
basis
or
a
subject
matter
of
a
tax,
then
a
totally
new
concept
would
have
been
annunciated.
the
theory
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
was
that
the
volume
of
shipments
was
so
substantial
that
such
commerce
in
fact
became
localized,
and
thus
separated
from
the
free
flow
of
commerce.
no
attempt
was
made
by
that
court
to
define
the
precise
buy-in
necessary
to
affect
this
localization.
in
other
words,
under
the
theory,
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
the
quantity
of
the
shipment
is
critical.
however,
this
court
will
notice
as
a
matter
of
contrast,
that
in
a
case
immediately
to
follow
this
one,
the
georgia
case,
the
state
of
georgia
argues
that
it's
the
quality
of
the
connection
between
the
state
and
the
foreign
corporation
that
is
important.
and
of
course
the
reason
the
state
of
georgia
argues
that
is
because
in
their
case,
less
than
1%
of
that
company's
business
was
shipped
in
the
state
of
georgia.
now
it
would
seem
that
neither
quality
nor
quantity,
nor
regularity,
could
really
turn
interstate
commerce
into
something
that
it
actually
is
not.
now
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
had
this
taxpayer
been
engaged
in
some
intrastate
activity,
then
such
activity
in
and
of
itself
might
have
been
used
as
a
springboard
upon
which
to
base
the
tax.
for
instance,
if
this
taxpayer
had
a
plant
in
minnesota
there
would
be
no
problem
of
jurisdictional
due
process.
that
was
the
situation
in
which
this
court
upheld
levy
in
the
wisconsin
income
tax,
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
glue
company.
there
the
taxpayer
was
a
domiciliary
of
wisconsin
and
it
had
a
manufacturing
plant
there,
and
it
did
a
large
intrastate
business.
the
only
question
there
was
whether
the
statute
violated
the
commerce
clause,
not
the
due
process
clause
because
the
substantive
due
process
was
well
satisfied,
and
that
is
found
in
many
of
the
cases
of
this
court,
such
as
international
harvester
against
evatt,
ford
motor
company
against
beauchamp,
west
publishing
company
against
mccolgan,
and
butler
brothers
against
the
same
commissioner,
but
none
of
those
cases
was
jurisdictional
due
process
involved
were
there
were
local
events.
such
cases
are
no
different.
in
those
situations
where
this
court
has
time
and
time
again
upheld
ad
valorem
property
taxes,
even
though
the
property
was
used
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce.
in
every
such
instance,
however,
intrastate
activities
did
exist.
similar
are
those
cases
where
gross
earnings
taxes
upheld
in
lieu
of
an
ad
valorem
property
tax.
now
in
shaffer
against
carter,
the
right
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
to
tax
the
income
of
a
non-resident
from
business
carried
on
in
oklahoma
was
upheld.
in
doing
so
this
court
reaffirmed
the
doctrine,
first
pronounced
by
justice
brewster
in
the
michigan
central
railroad
company
case,
that
the
only
possible
subjects
of
any
tense,
are
persons,
property
and
business.
in
the
miller
bros.
case
this
court
again
reaffirmed
that
principal
and
necessarily
then
the
power
of
taxation,
from
a
substantive
jurisdictional
standpoint
is
limited
to
those
three
subject
matters,
persons,
property
and
business.
the
oklahoma
tax
upon
a
non-resident
was
upheld
because
the
business
was
in
oklahoma.
under
on
the
same
theory
this
court
has
upheld
tax
levied
on
rental
income
received
from
real
estate
by
a
new
york
resident,
even
though
the
real
estate
was
located
with
--
out
of
the
state
of
new
york.
there
again
the
subject
matter
was
the
privilege
or
domiciled
residents
of
the
person.
it
was
not
upon
the
real
estate
located
outside
of
the
state
of
new
york.
so
too
in
(inaudible)
against
the
state
of
mississippi,
this
court
held,
and
i
think
properly
so,
that
mississippi
could
impose
an
income
tax,
upon
all
of
the
earnings
of
a
resident,
wherever
those
earning
were
earned.
the
reason
for
it
is
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
tax
was
within
the
state
of
mississippi,
and
in
answer
to
chief
justice's
question,
iowa
under
that
case
could
impose
a
tax
because
it's
a
domiciliary
state
upon
100%
of
income
of
this
company.
but
the
tax
in
those
cases
is
not
upon
income
as
the
subject
matter,
it
is
upon
the
subject
matter
and
it
is
measured
by
the
income.
in
all
of
those
instances,
you
will
find
that
the
state
has
put
some
benefits,
it
has
given
some
protection,
it's
afforded
some
privileges,
not
arising
out
of
the
federal
constitution
itself.
now
if
we
try
to
analyze
what
tax
is
we
find
that
it
has
three
matters
--
sorry
three
elements.
first
it
has
a
subject
matter,
secondly
it
has
a
measure
and
third
it
has
a
rate.
now
in
the
shaffer
case
the
subject
matter
was
said
to
persons,
property
and
business.
legislative
requirement
of
jurisdiction
of
due
process
applies
only
to
the
subject
matter
of
a
tax.
once
they
have
satisfied
that,
the
measure
and
the
rate
become
unimportant.
where
the
subject
matter
is
clearly
defined,
we
have
no
--
we
do
not
have
much
trouble
with
the
application
of
due
process
from
a
substantive
point
of
view.
but
we
must
recognize
that
modern
day
taxes
have
become
so
refined
that
it
is
often
difficult
to
differentiate
between
the
subject
matter
of
the
tax
and
measure
which
the
tax
employs.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
say
the
only
possible
instance
could
be
interstate
commerce,
which
is
invalid
incident.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
they
merely
define
it
your
honor
as
being
a
general
income
tax,
and
they
said
the
systematic
and
regularity
of
solicitation
localized
the
business
because
of
the
volume
of
shipments
into
the
state.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
they
are
not
authorized
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
minnesota
supreme
court
specifically
held
that
carrying
on
this
business
within
the
state
was
not
a
condition
precedent
--
i
mean
the
payment
of
the
tax
was
not
a
condition
precedent
to
carrying
on
this
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
they
are
not
in
the
state
in
the
sense
that
they
are
not
part
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
would
doubt
that
they
could.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
there
is
nothing
in
minnesota
that
could
levy
to
tax
upon,
unless
it
be
some
accounts
receivable
and
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
no
sanction
except
under
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
it
could
be
quite
good
in
the
state
of
iowa.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
we
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
yes,
that's
my
preface.
we
think
under
the
international
shoe
company
case
that
minnesota
has
jurisdiction
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
--
in
personam.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
served
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that's
right,
very
different
question.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
no
sanction
except
the
sanction
of
money.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
oh
yes,
that
is
conceded
here.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
in
question,
yes.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
oh,
no
then
we
would
have
satisfied
the
question
of
due
process
and
commerce.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
i
think
when
we
get
to
the
commerce
clause,
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
at
least
that
any
time
you
tax
interstate,
pure
interstate
commerce
that
you
have
subject
it
to
the
possibility
of
multiple
taxation,
undue
burden
on
intrastate
commerce
can
never
possibly
be
subjected
to.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
there
is
always
a
question
of
which
ones
of
these
comes
first.
i
always
--
it
seems
to
me
--
at
least
i
deem
that
if
you
don't
have
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
then
there
is
no
use
discussing
the
next
matter
and
to
my
notion
minnesota
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
in
all
of
these
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
now
as
i
am
pointing
out,
there
are
sometimes
often
--
differentiate
between
these
modern
concepts
of
taxation.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
just
unless
you
--
this
court
desires
to
emphasize
greatly
the
question
of
labels,
the
incident
of
the
tax
and
all
that
is
exactly
the
same
and
the
impact
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
the
connecticut
courts
held
that
incident
of
the
tax
was
the
privilege
of
carrying
on
the
business
in
that
state,
and
there
is
no
question
about
that
and
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
and
this
court
followed
it
explicitly.
what
this
court
would
have
done
is
not
the
spector
had
not
(inaudible)
known?
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
of
course
there
we
had
no
question
of
the,
of
substantive
due
process
or
legislative
jurisdiction
because
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
yeah
they
were
called
by
to
do
business
within
the
state
of
connecticut,
we
are
not.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
i
feel
there
maybe
an
error
that
if
there
is
no
due
process
over
this
company
at
all,
then
clearly
this
thing
has
to
be
sent
back
and
reversed
because
the
question
was
raised
and
of
course
with
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right,
yes.
i
claim
it
violates
both,
question
in
my
mind.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
if
iowa
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
unanimous
decisions
in
the
(inaudible)
case
can
tax
a
100%
income
of
this
company,
and
if
this
court
in
this
series
of
cases
have
laid
down
a
rule
that
minnesota
can
also
tax
and
only
wisconsin
can
tax
and
north
and
south
dakota
can
tax,
there
remains
a
question
that
interstate
commerce
is
going
to
be
subjected
to
moldable
version
that
you
can't
possibly
subject
a
corporation
to
the
state
all
within
the
confines
and
boundaries
of
one
state.
this
can't
be
done
as
a
practical
physical
matter.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
for
the
years
in
question?
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
it's
about
102,000.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
13
years
it
runs
all
the
way
from
a
few
thousand
dollars
to
five,
six,
seven
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
say
they
cannot
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
yes,
indeed.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
i
am
trying
to
aim
in
that
direction
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
the
west
publishing
company
case,
the
elements
in
that
case
are
considerable
different
than
they
were
here,
of
course
there
was
a
per
curiam
affirmance
by
the
court,
and
the
merits
were
not,
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
considered
or
not,
but
at
least
they
was
no
oral
argument.
the
west
publishing
company
case,
you
know,
were
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
in
the
case
the,
in
that
case
they
were
considerable
amount
of
intrastate
activities
that
took
place,
that
did
not
take
place
here.
they
were
collections
by
the
salesmen
and
there
were
adjustments
made
by
their
salesmen,
they
kept
an
inventory
of
books
within
the
state.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
on
a
commerce
point
case
i
think
that
the
west
publishing
company
case
is
only
a
commerce
point
case
and
--
but
it's
distinguishable
or
not
from
this
case,
i
am
not
so
sure,
i
haven't
the
record
yet,
but
i
do
say
that
it
was
not
decided
on
the
due
process
states
--
question.
now
sometimes
when
it
comes
to
analyzing
an
income
tax,
we
will
sometimes
lose
sight
of
the
distinction
between
the
question
of
the
basis
of
the
tax
and
the
measure
of
the
tax.
and
sometimes
some
courts
have
had
the
tendency
to
discuss
what
i
think
is
the
equitable
nature
of
the
tax
and
thus
neglect
the
real
question
which
is
whether
or
not
the
subject
matter
of
the
tax
itself
is
within
the
states'
grasp.
exemplifying
i
think
this
type
of
tax
is
a
comparison
between
the
ad
valorem
real
property
tax
which
is
levied
on
real
estate
as
a
subject,
but
still
measured
by
the
real
estates'
value
and
on
other
hand
a
gross
earnings
tax
on
a
utilities'
gross
earnings
as
a
measure,
but
the
tax
is
actually
on
the
property
we'll
get
within
the
state.
now
what's
seen
in
this
type
of
case
that
it
would
be
impossible
with
regard
to
income
in
and
of
itself
as
a
subject
rather
than
a
measure
of
a
tax?
now
the
reason
for
this
is
that
income
is
merely
an
abstraction
which
is
arrived
at
by
pre-described
mathematical
means.
it
is
an
artificial
norm
which
provides
a
measure,
but
which
by
reason
of
its
abstract
character
cannot
logically
provide
a
foundation
or
the
subject
matter
of
tax
itself.
now
most
state
taxes
are
well
grounded
from
this
stand
point
because
normally
they
are
up
on
the
residences
or
up
on
the
domestic
aided
corporation.
and
the
result
of
that
at
sometimes
have
led
some
courts
to
assume
that
so
long
as
the
income
tax
is
fairly
apportioned,
it
can
be
applied
with
respect
to
any
income
which
the
state
directs
the
tax
at
even
though
there's
not
a
proper
subject
matter
within
the
state
to
ascertain
that
tax.
and
it's
for
this
reason
that
judicial
reference
to
local
activities
or
intrastate
activities
has
reached
a
paramount
significance
of
income
tax
cases.
a
search
for
a
local
activity
represents
a
proper
(inaudible)
such
as
a
search
for
the
primer
essential
to
tax,
namely
a
subject
matter
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
now
a
law,
if
even
--
if
we
could
look
at
this
case
from
a
stand
point
of
an
equitable
basis
and
ignore
for
a
moment
the
tremendous
upsetting
impact,
if
these
taxes
could
be
leveraged
by
every
state
in
the
(inaudible)
we
might
ask
what
benefits
have
been
sort
afforded
this
tax,
they're
equitable
entitled
to
this
tax.
it
argues
of
course
this
has
provided
a
civilized
and
local
community
in
which
the
shipments
can
be
made,
that's
a
right
guaranteed
by
the
federal
constitution,
it
is
argued
that
it
provides
highways.
but
for
that
it
can,
under
decisions
of
this
court,
levy
a
highway
users'
tax.
as
it
says
it
has
given
the
peace
protection
to
its
property
but
if
it
has
it
can
impose
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
upon
that
property.
and
it
is
argued
it
didn't
go
in
minnesota
courts,
well
this
corporation
is
doing
a
local
business
and
it's
not
qualified
within
minnesota
and
minnesota
need
not
let
it
go
into
its
courts.
i
think
this
case,
the
facts
of
this
case
bring
it
squarely
within
the
decision
of
the
alpha
portland
cement
company
case
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
you
read
this
record,
it
will
be
clear
that
northwestern
patterns
it's
business
practices,
so
come
exactly
within
the
alpha
case
and
there
this
court
held
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
a
state
may
not
tax
property
beyond
its
borders
under
the
guise
of
taxing
intrastate
business,
of
activities
carried
on
by
alpha
in
massachusetts
were
greater
than
those
here.
alpha
had
a
bank
account
in
massachusetts,
there
was
none
in
minnesota.
alpha
solicitors
made
collections,
northwestern's
do
not.
alpha
solicitors
ordinarily
took
orders
and
forwarded
them.
northwestern's
normally
do
not,
they
go
around
and
they
are
goodwill
missionaries
and
the
orders
normally
go
directly
into
the
office
of
the
company
at
mason
city
for
acceptance
or
rejection,
the
same
as
one
aspect
or
element
of
the
northern
case
in
illinois.
now
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
that
each
activity
in
interstate
commerce
is
a
taxable
event,
and
taxes
multiply
only
in
the
sense
that
each
state
taxes
that
which
occurs
within
its
own
borders.
the
argument
is
then
advanced
that
a
tax
by
more
than
one
state
is
not
upon
the
same
activity
and
therefore
it's
valid.
if
that
theory
is
to
be
followed,
minnesota
is
free
exact
the
tax
because
of
solicitation,
then
other
states
to
which
any
such
commerce
extends
may
with
people
rightly,
of
any
tax
on
any
activity.
if
solicitation
of
sales
such
as
separate
activity,
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
sending
out
of
agents
to
make
purchases
of
raw
materials
would
be
just
as
much
as
separate
activity
to
many
commercial
concerns
and
then
take
this
purchase
of
raw
materials
is
much
more
important
than
the
sales
of
product.
in
our
own
state
of
minnesota
where
our
rich
beams
of
iron
ore
are
--
host
of
cheap
water
transportation
are
fast
disappearing.
that
raw
material
is
much
more
important
than
the
question
of
finding
a
market
for
it.
certainly
it
must
be
conceded
that
each
activity
in
interstate
commerce
is
a
perquisite
to
the
final
result.
solicitation
is
only
one
of
those.
there
is
no
more
justification
for
singling
out
that
activity
as
a
taxable
event,
than
it
is
for
separating
out
the
natural
gas
that
is
absolutely
necessary
the
fuel
with
which
to
produce
the
tremendous
heat
that
is
necessary
to
make
this
cement.
acquisition
of
that
gas
from
texas
as
well
these
had
to
be
a
separate
activity
of
solicitation.
it
is
more
essential
and
by
far
more
regular
and
more
continuous
for
it
is
used
24
hours
a
day,
seven
day
a
week,
everyday
of
the
year.
now
the
argument
has
been
made
that
the
taxing
of
a
business
twice
is
no
difference
than
doubling
the
tax.
in
other
words,
if
this
company
is
taxed
in
iowa,
and
taxed
in
minnesota,
it
is
no
different
than
if
iowa
doubled
the
rate.
this
does
not
necessarily
follow
for
the
rate
is
doubled
for
intrastate
business
just
as
well.
the
intrastate
merchant
has
other
safeguards.
first
he
is
a
part
of
the
electorate
and
he
can
protect
himself
at
the
ballet
box.
then
too
if
a
state
doubles
its
rate
its
intrastate
business
is
going
be
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
and
therefore
it's
not
going
to
economically
practicable.
so
doubling
the
rate
is
much
different
than
letting
more
than
one
state
tax
or
letting
five
states
tax
and
let
each
member
double
the
rate.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
there
has
been
no
specific
showing
in
this
record
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
well
if
this
court
lays
down
the
rule
that
interstate
commerce
can
be
the
subject
matter
of
a
tax
is
what
will
happen.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
yes
sir.
now
we
all
recognize
of
course
that
in
adopting
the
constitution
these
states
gave
up
certain
aspects
of
their
sovereignty
in
certain
specified
areas
and
that
was
to
regulate
commerce
and
the
power
was
given
to
this
court
(inaudible)
national
legislation
to
see
whether
there
was
a
burden
or
interference
with
interstate
commerce.
and
in
addition
when
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted,
the
states
further
relinquished
another
portion
of
their
sovereignty
by
the
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that
was
the
right
for
them
to
determine
themselves
whether
a
tax
such
as
this
and
in
many
other
fields
overlaps
so
as
to
interfere
with
our
national
welfare
and
harmony.
now
the
proper
limitation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
exercising
of
the
tax
sovereignty
of
the
states
to
subjects
within
their
jurisdiction
is
as
vital
to
the
political
and
economic
harmony
of
this
union,
as
are
the
restrictions
on
state
sovereignty
imposed
by
the
other
sections
of
the
constitution,
including
the
commerce
clause.
well
this
court
will
be
continued
to
be
guided
by
the
principle
that
interstate
commerce
in
and
of
itself
does
not
constitute
a
jurisdictionally
sound
subject
matter
upon
which
to
base
an
income
tax
from
a
due
process
standard
will
not
deprive
the
state
of
their
revenue.
this
court
has
in
prior
decisions
chartered
a
course
under
which
states
can
impose
a
tax
even
upon
corporations
carrying
on
interstate
commerce
activities.
where
there
are
intrastate
activities
itself
they
can
use
that
as
a
springboard.
the
states
should
not
either
through
their
clamor
for
more
revenues
or
any
theory
of
alleged
state
rights
be
permitted
to
destroy
the
area
of
free
trade
that
commerce
clause
sort
to
create.
we
recognize
that
interstate
commerce
must
pay
its
way,
but
it
does
pay
its
way
and
it
has
long
been
a
--
certainly
a
well
established
rule
by
this
court
that
a
state
may
not
impose
a
charge
for
the
enjoyment
of
a
right
granted
by
the
federal
constitution.
this
court
unanimously
held
so
in
murdock
against
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
where
they
refused
to
allow
the
license
tax
for
the
privilege
of
exercise
of
a
religion
on
a
theory
that
was
a
right
granted
by
the
federal
constitution.
now
the
argument
has
been
advanced
that
if
minnesota
is
not
permitted
to
impose
this
tax,
intrastate
commerce
will
act
as
a
disadvantage.
well
that's
not
true,
because
under
the
lawrence
case
iowa
can
tax
100%
of
this
income,
the
same
as
minnesota
can
tax
100%
of
income
of
companies
domiciled
there.
and
this
taxpayer
pays
all
the
local
taxes
to
iowa
that
minnesota
corporations
pay
to
minnesota.
and
under
the
series
of
cases
which
this
court
handed
down
in
the
used
tax
cases
and
the
sales
tax
cases,
minnesota
could
have
imposed
a
used
tax
on
the
sale
of
cement
in
the
state
of
iowa.
and
had
it
done
so
it
would
have
received
over
this
period
of
years
over
half
a
million
dollars
rather
than
the
amount
of
which
it's
seeking
in
this
action.
now
merely
because
minnesota
does
not
want
to
follow
that
constitutional
avenue
of
taxation
there
is
no
reason
why
this
court
should
extend
it
a
helping
hand.
and
minnesota
like
california
in
its
brief
filed
amicus
here
cannot
claim
that
this
is
a
substantial
source
of
its
revenue,
because
it
is
not.
minnesota
would
not
expect
a
decision
either
if
someone
had
you
believe
that
brought
about
the
resistance
to
this
type
of
taxation.
minnesota
has
never
sought
to
enforce
this
tax.
it
was
until
20
years
after
this
law
was
adopted
that
minnesota
commenced
this
proceeding.
it's
obvious
minnesota
has
not
then
relied
upon
this
as
a
source
of
its
revenue.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
administratively
your
honor
i
do
not
know,
i
do
know
that
they
--
after
–
i
think
long
after
spector
decision
they
decided
to
mention
(inaudible).
so
the
states
haven't
been
relying
on
this
and
the
court
will
notice
in
supplemental
record
filed
by
the
stockham
case
today,
the
commissioner
of
the
state
of
california
said
that
this
type
of
income
being
taxed
by
the
state
of
california
would
produce
about
$600,000
a
year
out
of
$210
million
or
one-fourth
or
1%
of
its
total
tax
revenues.
so
it
is
not
the
type
of
tax
these
states
have
relied
upon
for
any
of
the
revenues
whatsoever.
they
haven't
enforced
it,
and
at
this
late
stage
to
enforce
this
type
of
tax
will
create
chaos
among
companies
doing
business
in
interstate
commerce.
and
it's
not
the
type
of
the
company
like
a
general
motors
or
the
ford
motor
company
or
general
electric
that
is
going
to
be
bothered
if
this
court
upholds
this
kind
of
tax.
it's
a
small
company,
doing
business
in
one
or
two
or
three
states.
the
large
companies
already
have
qualified
to
do
business
throughout
the
48
states
of
this
union.
they
are
paying
those
taxes
because
they
can
pay
an
excise
tax
on
the
privilege
to
do
business
within
those
states.
so
this
type
of
tax
will
only
or
mainly
upon
the
small
company,
it's
a
tax
the
states
have
not
relied
upon
for
their
revenue,
it's
a
tax
which
of
course
they
sought
to
enforce
as
an
afterthought.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
justice
black
i
think
it
goes
to
the
question
whether
administratively
they
thought
this
law
was
constitutional
or
not.
i
think
the
administrative
interpretation
of
a
law
is,
it
was
not
unconstitutional
and
perhaps
because
of
a
change
in
administration
in
a
local
level
they
say,
they
try
and
see
what
happens.
it
surely
would
not
have
waited
20
years
from
any
other
theory.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
just
as
an
administrative
matter
which
i
understand
is
not
of
course
binding
upon
this
court.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
had
no
more
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
--
mr.
chief
justice
except
to
comment
on
the
northwestern
consolidated
milling
company
case,
but
if
were
going
to
file
a
memo
on
that,
i
assume
that
will
take
care
of
the
facts
of
the
situation
there.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
the
differences
are
that
northwestern
consolidated
milling
company
case,
the
salesmen
for
the
company
went
into
massachusetts.
they
would
go
from
--
to
be
a
user
of
cement
and
say
why
you
don't
buy
ours
--
not
cement
but
the
milling
and
the
flour,
why
don't
you
buy
our
flour
say
a
grocery
store.
the
groceries
say
all
right,
so
he
had
taken
an
order
from
the
grocery
for
so
many
barrels
or
bags
of
flour
or
whatever
they
were
in
those
days,
and
he
takes
that
order
back
to
a
wholesaler
within
the
state
and
the
wholesaler
would
fill
that
order.
in
this
case
the
solicitors
at
no
time
ever
took
an
order,
every
order
they
ever
took
and
the
trial
court
so
found
was
subject
to
a
rejection
or
acceptance
back
at
the
home
office.
surely
if
they
encouraged
a
dealer
to
try
to
sell
a
contractor
cement
when
a
building
was
going
to
be
built
and
the
dealer
would
ask,
well
what
price
can
i
give
this
contractor
and
so
they
would
send
from
mason
city,
iowa
a
quotation
that
they
could
use
in
billing
them
flour
and
giving
the
content
--
to
give
the
contractor,
so
that
the
contractor
could
bid
on
the
particular
building
job
or
road
job
or
whatever
it
was,
but
at
no
time,
did
they
ever
take
an
order
from
a
dealer
or
from
a
user
of
cement,
from
one
to
the
other
and
give
it
within
the
state
itself,
every
order
went
back
to
mason
city,
quotations
were
for
the
convenience
of
the
customer,
so
that
the
customer
in
turn
could
quote
to
a
user
on
perhaps
a
bid
job,
for
instance
a
state
highway
job,
because
contractors
must
know
the
price
at
which
they
can
purchase
their
raw
materials
before
they
put
in
a
bid
and
those
raw
materials
prices
must
be
firm
until
that
--
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right,
in
every
instance,
without
exception.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
right,
yeah.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
that
is
the
quotation
form,
yes,
and
that
had
to
go
back
to
mason
city,
iowa
for
acceptance
or
rejection,
no
salesmen
were
ever
authorized
to
sign
these
forms.
that
is
there.
mr.
joseph
a.
maun
i
think
it's
the
same
difference
we
find
in
the
mccolgan
cases,
where
the
delivery
took
place,
in
new
york,
here
the
--
order
take
place
in
iowa,
both
under
minnesota
and
iowa
statues.
