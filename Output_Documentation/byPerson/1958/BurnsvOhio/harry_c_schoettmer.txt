mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
may
i
please
the
court.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
counsel
suggested
that
i
knew
this
case
personally
as
of
the
trial
level
and
however
that's
just
not
so,
i
did
not
try
the
case,
it's
an
assistant
tried
it
who
is
long
gone,
however
it
fell
upon
my
shoulders
to
take
it
after
he
left,
i
have
to
bury
his
dead,
even
though
this
man
is
obviously
still
alive.
justice
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
say
that
your
position
here,
that
this
is
a
letter
from
a
clerk
and
not
a
judgment
is
the
correct
position
that
this
man
should
go
back
and
do
something
else
and
get
a
judgment
first
and
when
i
first
came
into
burns'
case
in
this
appeal
i
had
a
very
similar
thought,
however,
i
think
we
have
to
concede
this
fact
that
this
letter
from
the
clerk
is
in
reality
and
in
effect
the
judgment
of
the
court.
in
other
words
it
would
be
impossible
in
ohio
for
a
citizen
to
file
a
mandamus
action
in
the
supreme
court
without
paying
$20.
it
is
also
impossible
and
there
is
a
court
decision
on
this
in
the
wanamaker
case,
wanamaker
versus
miller
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
cited,
that
a
petitioner
or
a
plaintiff
could
not
file
a
mandamus
action
against
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
in
a
court
of
appeals.
even
though
be
could
file
it
in
forma
pauperis
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
would
not
lie
against
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court.
the
wannamaker
case
spells
out
fairly
firmly.
so,
admittedly
this
is
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
your
honor
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
160,
it's
on
page
ten
of
petitioner's
brief
in
the
note,
164
ohio
state
174.
here
is
the
case
in
question,
and
i
think
we
have
to
face
up
to
it.
as
your
honor
pointed
out
this
is
a
unique
case,
we
have
no
record
to
go
back
to,
we
have
no
law
as
such
except
the
griffin,
there
is
no
long
line
of
thought
on
this
issue,
but
i
think
we
can
say
this,
that
in
the
first
instance
we
should
concede
therefore
that
the
letter
of
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
is
in
effect
the
judgment
of
the
ohio
supreme
court,
and
i
say
that
because
in
my
interpretation
of
wannamaker
case,
there
were
certain
--
there
was
this
mandamus
action
brought
against
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
and
the
supreme
court
members
all
stepped
down
and
court
of
appeals
members
stepped
up
and
made
the
decision
in
the
wannamaker
case.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
i
think
in
effect
in
the
law
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
that
that
has
to
be
accepted
your
honor,
even
though
we
would
love
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
well,
it
is
a
unique
position
for
that
reason.
our
second
point
that
i
think
we
should
concede
here
in
this
burns
case
is
it
without
the
payment
of
$20
by
burns
that
no
papers
could
be
filed
in
the
supreme
court
and
therefore
he
could
not
file
under
the
law
his
motion
for
leave
to
appeal.
now
your
honor
you
mentioned
before,
so
how
he
could
possibly
get
into
court?
suppose
the
supreme
court
wanted
to
hear
a
case
that
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
how
could
it
get
to
the
court?
has
there
ever
been
a
circumstance
where
the
supreme
court
has
ordered
a
case
that
had
been
heard
in
the
court
of
appeals
into
its
court?
that
if
ohio
does
have
that
procedure,
the
supreme
court
can
order
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
certified
to
it.
at
this
stage
of
our
history
in
ohio
we
have
not
had
the
position
in
such
a
circumstance
that
the
party
could
not
pay
the
$20.
without
question
in
my
opinion,
if
that
did
happen,
if
that
were
true
in
burns,
without
question
if
the
supreme
court
said
we
want
to
hear
that
case
from
a
first
district
appellate
court
bring
it
up
here,
if
burns
comes
in
and
says
well
your
honor
i
don't
have
$20,
i
am
confident
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
would
say
we'll
waive
the
$20
without
any
question
in
my
mind
that
the
supreme
court
would
not
(inaudible)
its
own
order
because
of
its
rule
of
$20.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
on
that
question,
but
this
just
establishes
our
point
that
much
harder
and
that
is
this.
in
the
light
of
the
concessions
that
we
have
made
here,
these
two
points,
we
feel
that
and
we
request
that
it
be
conceded
that
a
court,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
this
court,
any
court
has
a
right
to
determine
the
conditions
precedent
to
the
procedure
to
be
followed
in
perfecting
an
appeal
to
that
court,
as
long
as
they
are
reasonable.
now
when
they
are
unreasonable,
when
they
are
completely
out
of
hand
without
question,
the
court
maybe
infringing
on
somebody's
rights,
but
as
long
as
these
conditions
precedent
are
reasonable,
we
feel
that
without
question
any
court
can
say
what
a
man
has
to
do
in
order
to
perfect
an
appeal
to
that
court,
why?
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
you
honor
i
don't
know
why
it's
so
necessary
to
say
that
money
is
such
a
separate
and
distinct
type
of
condition
precedent
to
any
other
type
of
condition
that
might
be
put
forth.
any
number
of
things
a
court
can
say
that
it
has
to
be
done
by
the
defendant
or
by
the
appellant
in
order
to
get
in.
now
why
we
should
select
money
as
some
significant
or
extra
important
sensitive
condition
i
just
don't
understand
that.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
that's
one
your
honor,
no
this
is
another.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
counsel
mentioned
notice,
now
let's
assume
that
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
that's
right
and
if
one
does
not,
then
he
doesn't
get
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
well,
i
don't
think
it's
invidious
or
hurtful
and
i
suggest
that
to
your
honor
in
the
light
of
my
discussion
with
the
chief
justice
in
that,
in
the
history
of
ohio
we've
never
had
that
circumstance
develop
in
an
appeal,
up
to
this
time,
up
to
this
man.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
well
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
well,
a
pauper,
what
is
a
pauper
as
such
your
honor,
i
know
you
have
--
this
court
has
declared
to
what
is
it,
but
even
here,
even
in
this
court,
when
you
allowed
a
man
to
file
in
a
pauper
(inaudible),
is
he
a
true
pauper?
a
true
pauper
i
suggest
to
this
court
without
aid
without
assistance
of
some
kind
cannot
get
into
this
court,
because
you
demand
of
course
that
he
file
some
written,
typewritten
pleading.
he
must
have
something
here
must
he
not?
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
no.
but
every
convict
in
ohio,
i
suggest
has
money.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
every
convict
in
ohio
has
money.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
we
do.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
i
would
say
about
three
months.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
he
gets
about
--
a
single
man
in
ohio,
this
is
revised
code
514516,
a
single
person
who
is
a
convict
in
ohio
gets
$0.04
an
hour.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
nine
hour
day.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
automatically,
that's
by
statute.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
no
we
do
not
your
honor,
we
do
not.
but
if
he
has
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
without
question,
the
warden
has
to
account
to
it.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
the
problem
--
all
right
sorry
your
honor,
the
problem
comes
out
is
who
has
to
determine
he
is
a
pauper.
he
signs
an
affidavit,
and
i'm
sure
the
law
is
fairly
general
concerning
men
with
these
criminal
records,
should
we
believe
them
right
off,
should
the
state
go
out
and
examine
what
his
accounts
are
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
that's
right.
now
the
question
is
if
a
man
has
an
honest
appeal,
can
he
somewhere
sometime
in
his
course
of
conduct
after
his
appeal
by
the
appellant
court,
get
$20?
we
maintain
that
this
$20,
if
you
please
as
set
forth
by
the
court,
is
one
of
those
reasons,
one
of
those
manners,
one
of
those
means
that
the
court
uses
to
stop
frivolous
appeals,
to
stop
men
who
were
just
--
fought
the
court
to
come
in
and
talk
to
it.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
you
honor
it
has
not
been,
and
for
this
reason
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
in
effect
on
the
application
for
writ
of
certiorari,
we
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
we
should
have
raised
it
at
that
point
and
i
had
in
a
note
here,
to
have
raised
it
at
that
time
and
it
was
not
raised
when
the
application
for
writ
was
granted
by
the
court.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
i
assume
not
your
honor,
but
i'm
only
trying
to
put
forth
the
type
of
case
as
this,
that
this
is
an
important
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
this
particular
defendant
then.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
this
is
what
we're
interested
in
and
we
think
that
our
decision
by
this
court,
that
would
go
along
the
line
and
extend
the
griffin
case
for
this
defendant
is
unfortunate,
for
this
reason,
already
this
court
has
had
the
merits,
the
factual
matter
of
the
case
before
it,
in
the
form
of
the
codefendant
who
had
paid
his
$20
and
who
did
file
application
of
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
on
the
merits
of
the
case
itself.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
that's
was
the
lotts
case
your
honor.
it
was
--
i
have
a
note
on
it.
lotts
versus
state
of
ohio,
certiorari
denied
december
15,
1958,
supreme
court
report,
115
volume
79
number
5
miscellaneous
docket
482
are
the
numbers
that
i
have.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
yes
your
honor,
all
the
way
they
were
jointly
tired
together.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
it
was
burglary
of
an
inhabitant
dwelling
and
which
carries
of
course
a
life
sentence
when
no
mercy
is
extended
by
the
jury.
second
county
indictment
was
grant
larceny
in
the
matter
of
stealing.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
there
was
your
honor.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
yes.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
well
–
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
whatever
is
reasonable
your
honor
and
each
case
must
stand
on
its
merits
as
to
what
is
the
reasonable.
now
in
this
case
we
have
$20.
we
maintain
that
$20
is
reasonable.
the
$20
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
in
the
year
1959
we
cannot
conceive
of
a
position
where
a
defendant
is
in
such
circumstances
that
if
he
is
--
wants
to
make
a
good
honest
appeal,
it
is
not
privilege,
it
is
not
flaunting
the
court
that
he
somewhere
cannot
pay
his
$20
fee.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
i
suppose
the
truth
your
honor.
i
think
we
have
to
look
as
to
whether
it's
reasonable
or
not
and
justice
frankfurter
made
this
statement
in
the
griffin
case,
he
said
something
to
this
effect.
in
order
for
--
to
avoid
or
immunize
abuse
and
waste
a
state
may
appropriately
hedge,
not
only
gives
leave
for
--
about
the
opportunity
to
prove
a
conviction
wrong.
when
a
state
not
only
gives
leave
for
appellate
correction
of
trial
errors,
but
must
pay
for
the
cost
of
its
exercise
by
the
indigent,
it
may
protect
itself
so
that
frivolous
appeals
are
not
subsidized
and
pubic
money
is
not
needlessly
spent.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
well,
because
it
fellows
like
burns
your
honor,
remember
this
is
a
deputy
sheriff.
i
know
it's
not
the
record,
but
we
are
talking
about
burns
and
who
he
is
and
what
he
has
done
since
he
has
been
in
the
penitentiary.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
we
are.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
your
honor
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
undoubtedly
would
not
be
a
burden
upon
the
state
of
ohio
to
waive
this
$20
filing
fee.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
well,
only
because
we
feel
that
first
of
all
this
man
has
had
his
appeal,
that
the
griffin
rule
should
not
be
extended,
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
should
have
the
right
to
say
what
are
the
reasonable
necessary
procedures
and
we
feel
that
it
is
the
prerogative
of
that
court
to
determine
its
procedural
development
and
we're
confident
that
this
court
would
say
that
any
reasonable
procedure
that
supreme
court
says
it
must
have
is
perfectly
all
right.
we're
trying
to
suggest
this
court
--
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
well,
of
course
we
have
to
take
a
position
that
there
--
as
to
the
$20
filing
fee
and
honest
appellants,
ones
who
want
to
be
heard,
because
they
have
an
honest
conviction
in
their
rights
and
in
the
errors
that
were
committed
against
them,
we
feel
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
indigent
with
less
than
$20.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
that
has
to
be
our
position.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
i
don't
know
that
your
honor.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
i
think
the
court
said
–
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
yes
and
then
the
supreme
court
stepped
aside
and
reversed
it,
i
believe
that
was
right,
isn't
that
right
judge?
as
i
recall
the
case.
mr.
harry
c.
schoettmer
yes
he
did,
i
believe
he
denied
it
your
honor.
the
only
point
in
that
case,
that
i
said
what
i
did
was
this,
that
i
believe
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
the
clerk
must
do
whatever
the
supreme
court
says
it
must
do
as
a
robot,
as
an
(inaudible).
if
he
accepts
the
paper
incorrectly
against
the
orders
of
the
court
then
he
should
--
the
court
will
fire
him.
if
he
refuses
to
accept
papers,
and
the
court
will
have
to
handle
him
in
its
own
course
as
it
sees
fit
because
it
is
--
he
is
its
robot.
now
because
the
clerk
turns
down
the
applicant,
therefore
it
is
apparently
the
order
of
the
court
that
he
do
so.
that's
what
i
meant
your
honor.
