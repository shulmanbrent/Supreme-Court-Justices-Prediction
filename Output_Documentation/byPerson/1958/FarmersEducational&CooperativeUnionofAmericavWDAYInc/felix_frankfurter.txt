justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
break
in
before
you
go
on,
what
was
the
upside
of
'48
enquiry?
was
there
a
report
by
the
house
committee?
did
they
with
this
submitting
their
report
and
what
did
they
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
started
to
read,
i
haven't
hope
to
read
all
of
his
testimony,
it's
fairly
long,
mr.
coy,
but
he
was
very
emphatic
and
unqualified
in
his
then
view
that
reasons,
the
proper
construction
of
315
involved
or
led
to
imply
immunity
and
a
displacement
of
all
state
law,
even
though
unequivocally
in
his
testimony,
at
least
as
far
as
i've
read.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
are
you
saying
that
he
then
assured
congress,
that
although
that
--
his
view
of
the
law,
is
he
going
to
obey
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
investigate
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
about
it,
if
i
don't
qualify.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
say
then
that
--
did
he
give
assurances
as
chairman
of
the
commission
that
he
wouldn't
carry
out
what
he
conceived
to
be
the
clear
demand
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
usual
kind
of
medium
outlet
to
answer
the
questions
of
congressional
hearings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
understand
the
words
but
i
don't
get
the
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
an
assurance
it
is
when
he
says
first
the
law
is
clear
and
commands
us
to
do
this,
secondly
we
are
troubled
by
it,
the
committee's
question
(inaudible),
we
are
all
troubled
and
they
disagreed
with
him,
then
you
say
he
gave
assurance
and
said
we
moved
to
anything
that's
capricious.
well
nobody
says
its
going
to
do
anything
that's
capricious,
of
course
we
all
do
reasonable
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
of
my
question
is
to
elicit
if
i
can
what
can
fairly
be
called
or
rather
what
can
fairly
be
drawn
as
commanding
legislative
history
from
this
mass
of
contradictory
stuff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
the
fact
the
senate
did
have
that
immunizing
provision
to
which
you've
just
referred.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
also
in
48
paper
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
bill
comes
out
of
the
senate
to
the
house
having
an
explicitness
of
immunity
for
immunity.
these
investigators
particularly
congressmen
bow
is
shocked
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
coy
says
i
am
--
this
is
my
view,
then
he
says
--
then
you
say,
and
the
record
shows,
he
gives
assurances.
what
i
just
want
to
know
is
what
does
that
all
--
what
it
all
adds
up
to
when
you
get
through
reading
those
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
reference
to
that
report?
that's
what
i
want
to
know,
what
do
they
report?
i'm
still
old
fashioned
enough
to
look
for
authority
to
legislative
history
from
reports
and
not
from
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
legislation
would
recommend
it,
they
rejected
what
the
senate
proposed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
--
am
i
wrong
in
feeling
that
there
is
a
--
before
you
decide,
before
one
determines
whether
there
is
or
isn't
immunity
from
responsibility
setting
out
to
the
word
libel,
you
must
first
decide
whether
it
has
any
power
of
choice
about
it.
certainly
as
a
human,
as
a
human
proposition,
it
makes
a
lot
of
effort
if
i
have
no
choice
to
disseminate
something
and
then
sued
for
it
than
if
i
do
have
choice
and
exercise
the
choice
so
as
to
be
the
instrument
of
defamation.
so
don't
you
have
to
argue
first
whether
a
station
is
compelled
to
emit
whatever
any
candidate
is
asking
to
emit?
isn't
that
a
preliminary
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
depends,
that
depends
on
the
construction
of
the
no
censorship
clause
or
sections
rather
in
the
context
of
section
315
and
in
the
context
of
315
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
intended.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
there's
that
censorship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
got
to
do
--
you
got
to
face
that
censorship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
will
be
giving
content
and
meaning,
now
what
does
it
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
are
not
suggesting
that
i
can
get
the
answer
to
this
problem
by
going
to
the
oxford
dictionary,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
finding
out
in
the
roman
institution,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
is
being
urged
before
us
is
that
they
couldn't
even
censor
anything
obscene,
subversive,
whatever
that
may
mean
or
anything
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what's
that,
which
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
station,
and
the
station
--
it
is
your
view,
i
am
trying
to
elicit
what
your
views
are,
it
is
your
view
that
a
station
can
say
the
script
that
you
have
given
us
(inaudible)
mean
that
if
the
president
doesn't
sign
or
veto
bill,
damage
will
come,
do
you
think
you
can
interpret,
you
can
say
to
all
these
voir
dires
that's
what
this
means.
it
will
mean
to
the
ears
of
our
listeners
and
therefore
you
cut
off
that
paragraph,
do
you
think
you
can
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
suggesting
that
we
have
a
brief
submitted
in
which
it
is
denied
that
that
can
be
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
am
trying
to
find
out
the
materials
on
which
a
judgment
must
be
made
in
this
case
for
which
the
dictionary
meaning
of
the
word
‘censor'
is
not
the
last
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
they
say
you
can't
say
anything
blasphemous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
held
that
blasphemy
is
so
vague
a
term
that
a
statute
containing
it
is
unconstitutional
for
indefinite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bangert
may
i
ask
you
this
that
your
station
wday
and
other
stations
as
i
understand
require
that
the
candidate
who
want
to
send
their
messages
over
these
stations
submit
the
script
before
his
play
or
introduced,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
understand
if
the
censorship
is
absolute,
on
what,
by
what
right
can
they
exact
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
commercial
copy
doesn't
have
a
provision
about
north
west
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
understand
either
the
reason
or
the
defense
or
the
justification
for
making
me
submit
my
manuscript
if
you
can't
touch
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
this,
the
opinion
of
this
court
have
shown
there
are
certainly
not,
there
are
certainly
(inaudible)
excuse
as
to
what
does
or
does
not
constitute
obscenity
at
least
as
much
as
to
what
constitutes
libelous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
least
as
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
starting
with
the
assumption
that
you
must
let
every
candidate,
every
fellow
who
has
a
right
to
equal
time,
to
say
what
he
wants
to
say
no
matter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
starting
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
stop
with
that
assumption?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
does
it
make
clear
sense
as
to
what
--
not
clear
sense
as
to
obscenity
but
clear
sense
as
to
libelous,
i
don't
understand
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
have
no
trouble
about
the
consequences
of
displacement
of
state
law
(inaudible)
way
of
holding
one's
view
about
that
kind
of
thing,
i
have
no
trouble
at
all
that
congress
in
regulating
the
radio
industry
the
way
it
has
can
displace
the
consequences
of
a
reasonable
regulation,
what
ordinarily
would
be
controlling
state
law.
but
before
i
come
to
that,
i
want
to
know
such
displacement
is
required
by
the
system
of
regulation
.particularly
bearing
in
mind
in
addition
to
all
that
you
said,
differentiating
your
industry
from
newspapers
that
congress
explicitly
refused
to
make
radio
stations
a
common
carrier.
it
faced
that
question
and
it
refused
to
do
so,
as
you
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
--
when
it
starts
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
one
starts
there.
suppose
one
doesn't
start
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
would
(inaudible)
first
amendment
is
inapplicable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that
one
may
agree
with
you,
and
no
one
agrees
with
you
more
than
i
do
as
to
the
facts
far
reaching
importance
of
keeping
the
channels
(inaudible)
and
free,
but
for
one
who
doesn't
take
the
first
amendment
as
a
doctrine
absolute,
it
doesn't
answer
the
problem,
it
doesn't
conclude
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bangert,
would
you
forgive
me
if
i
press
you
a
little
more
on
this
obscenity
because
for
me
these
are
very
far
reaching
questions,
and
one
to
whom
the
first
amendment
is
not
an
absolute,
you
have
extra
difficulty.
you
say
and
apparently
all
the
briefs,
except
that
of
liberties
union,
(inaudible)
obscenity
and
so
on.
why
because
obscenity
is
criminal,
there
is
a
provision
in
the
penal
code
of
the
united
states
against
obscenity.
well
take
the
radio
stations
in
washington
dc.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
penal
code
of
washington
against
criminal
libel.
i
do
not
know
how
i
can
assess
criminal
prohibition
against
obscenity
as
of
a
more
superseding
potency
than
the
provision
of
the
criminal
code
against
criminal
libel.
now
in
the
district
with
its
stations
here,
well
we
can't
publish
this
because
this
constitutes
a
crime
in
the
penal
code
of
the
district,
in
an
act
passed
by
congress,
that's
not
your
client,
i
understand
that.(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
there
you
can
argue
that
the
federal
act
displaced
the
state
law,
but
in
the
district
you
can't
have
any
displacement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
is
obscenity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
really
am
mindful
of
the
difficulty
you
present
but
it's
equally
true
about
obscenity
and
it
is
equally
true
about
threatening
the
life
of
the
president
particularly
in
the
district,
we
have
actually
had
cases
of
threatening.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
don't
--
what
troubles
me,
will
you
forgive
me
for
saying
don't
give
me
much
comfort
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
differentiating
the
right
of
radio
station
to
if
you
let
me
say
so
censor,
obscenity
and
threat
to
a
person's
well
being
and
yet
not
libel,
i
don't
get
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
i
said
that's
not
the
wisest
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
you
think,
why
you
--
what
do
you
think
the
committee
headed
by
mr.
johannes
in
its
first
interim
report
that
was
out
of
that
investigation
meant
when
it
said
that
it
received
mr.
coy's
insurance
with
great
satisfaction,
what
kind
of
satisfaction.
what
satisfaction
did
he
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
i
get
from
reading
their
report
as
a
result
of
our
examination
that
the
court
–
you
were
on
decision,
your
committee
has
received
assurances
from
the
commission
that
and
i
quote,
(inaudible)
mr.
coy
who
incidentally
i
respect,
an
old
friend
(inaudible)
for
the
time
being
at
least
until
the
matter
is
settled,
the
honest
and
conscientious
broadcaster
who
uses
ordinary
common
sense
in
trying
to
prevent
obscene
and
slander
statements
from
going
out
over
the
air.
that's
the
assurance
he
gave
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
to
me
it
is
kind
of
a
-
if
were
asked
by
a
–
if
i
were
asked
to
make
a
broadcast
and
had
unqualified
power
to
say
what
i
wanted
to
say,
i
don't
want
the
station
to
argue
with
me
that
i
should
leave
out
something.
that's
also
form
of
a
censorship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
stations
are
also
powerful
and
they
might
persuade
me
because
i
consider
my
self
interest
not
to
offend
the
station.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
a
fact
that
the
21
years
they
made
no
ruling,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
it
so
for
21
years
we
had
no
administrative
ruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
since
‘48
they
did
the
best
they
could,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
there
has
been
a
continuous
uninterrupted
unquestioned
administrative
ruling
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
that
is
as
the
renewals
and
the
commission
itself
that
they
may
take
into
account
whether
a
station
permitted
libelous
stuff,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
understand
how
if
--
for
the
station
has
absolute
right
not
to
–
a
duty
not
to
censor
they
can
take
into
account,
that
it
has
censored
and
yet
grant
a
renewal
as
they
have,
haven't
they
in
stations
that
have
offended
that
rule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
well
know
this
court
has
in
many
cases,
not
of
this
sort,
found
significance
in
the
fact
that
one
house
had
a
provision
in
the
law
which
the
other
house
struck,
this
court
in
many
instances
has
found
significance
in
that
kind
of
a
legislative
unfolding,
that's
true
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
this
case
we've
had
on
several
instances
provisions
expressly
(inaudible)
knocked
out
by
the
other
house,
has
that
any
significance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
say
that
you
cancel
each
other
that's
my
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
the
starting
point,
but
there
must
let
anybody
say
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
newspaper
doesn't
have
to
put
in
any
ad
that
i
offer
it,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
never
described
what
the
scope
of
(inaudible)
we've
never
decided
the
scope
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
case
could
have
gone
off
on
state
grant
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
have
gone
off
on
a
state
ground
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
local
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
north
dakota
court,
that
we
are
going
to
make
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
decide
federal
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
an
accommodating
court.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting,
i
suppose
you
are
--
that
if
newspapers
are
regulated,
you
might
get
more
competition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
had
mark
antony's
speeches
in
actual
political
life
and
not
merely
in
shakespeare's
plays.
justice
felix
frankfurter
people
can
be
very
skillful
in
dealing
with
other
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
speak
very
confident
and
i
am
not
surprised
you
do,
in
construing
that
statute
as
disallowing,
it
leaving
a
station
free
to
accept
no
candidate,
but
as
i
understand
that
that
is
within
the
operating
etiquette
of
the
commission.
they
have
refused
renewals
where
a
station
has
exercised
that
right
on
the
ground
that
it's
against
public
policy
for
them
to
exercise
that
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
want
to
be
–
you
defending
them
i
guess
–[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
to
say
--
to
use
the
word
you
used
nobody
else
has
referred
it
up
to
now
that
seem
to
be
very
important,
it's
bearing
on
the
kind
of
obligation
that
rests
on
station.
if
my
reading
of
english
would
not
obscure
by
the
interpretation
that
the
commission
has
placed
upon
it,
i
should
think
the
sentence
is
pretty
clear
that
they
can
keep
hands
off
and
not
accept
any
political
fraudulence.
so
i
think
that's
--
not
only
as
a
commission
--
you
call
it
vacuolating
--
vacuolating
as
it
is
--
not
only
has
