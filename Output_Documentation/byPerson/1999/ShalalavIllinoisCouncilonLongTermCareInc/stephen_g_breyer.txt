justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
suppose
in
that
respect
that
you
have...
let's
not
take
this
case,
where
i
think
probably
the
issues
are
not
ripe,
but
let's
imagine
one
that
would
be
plainly
ripe.
suppose
the
secretary
has
a
completely
unreasonably
regulation.
every
nursing
home
has
to
build
its
entire
home
on
10-inch
thick
steel
girders,
and
then
it
says,
and
any
nursing
home
who
doesn't
comply
with
this
is
deprived
of
their
eligibility
forever.
all
right,
completely
unreasonable
rule,
and
moreover
they're
put
to
the
choice
of
either
complying
or
not.
at
enormous
expense
they
comply,
or
they
run
the
risk.
now,
that's
a
ripe,
preenforcement
review
issue.
in
your
opinion,
how
would...
if
that
were
the
reg,
how
would
they
get
review?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
but
i'm
simply
trying
to
get
an
example
of
a
rule
that's
ripe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
wouldn't
the
following
be
a
fairer
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
wouldn't
it
be
fairer
and
consistent
with
all
the
statutes
simply
to
say,
you've
just
mixed
up
ripeness
and
exhaustion?
their
claim
is
ripe.
405(g)
is
an
exhaustion
statute.
they
don't
have
to
violate
the
reg
to
exhaust.
they're...
if
it's
ripe,
it's
preenforcement
and
ripe.
exhaustion
means,
you
give
the
secretary
a
chance
to
pass
on
it,
so
you
write
the
secretary
a
letter
and
say,
dear
secretary,
i
think
your
reg
is
out
to
lunch,
but
you
have
a
chance
to
pass
on
it
first,
so
pass
on
it.
and
then,
having
done
that,
they
bring
the
results
to
court,
without
having
to
violate
the
statute.
there,
we
have
both
ripeness
and
exhaustion.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
but
they...
you're
saying
that
they
have
to
violate.
that's
what
they
don't
want
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
they
could
go
and
present
without
violating
by
writing
the
secretary
a
letter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
is
that
ripe,
though?
that's
why
i'm
putting
this
to
you.
are
you
saying
that's
what
they
should
do?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
you've
made...
you've
turned
it
into
a
ripeness
statute,
whereas
ringer
and
salfi
and
bowen
and
everyone
else
have
considered
it
an
exhaustion
statute,
and
easterbrook
and
everybody
say,
we're
not
discussing
ripeness,
and
so
what
i'm
thinking
is,
suppose
it
really
is
ripe,
it's
really
ripe.
what
you
happen
to
have
are
cases
where
maybe
it
isn't
ripe,
but
suppose
it
really
were?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
salfi
didn't
involve
this
issue.
salfi...
the
person
whom
they
permitted
to
proceed
in
salfi
was
a
person
who
had
exhausted.
the
person
whom
they
did
not
permit
to
proceed
were
the
group
of
class
action
plaintiffs
who
hadn't
exhausted.
so
there's
no
problem
with
salfi,
and
bowen
is
an
effort
to
get
the
people
who
don't
have
any
other
route
an
appeal,
a
way
of
proceeding,
and
consistent
with
both
of
those
two
would
be
to
say,
if
you're
ripe,
you
exhaust...
you
know.
i
don't
want
to
repeat
myself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
it
doesn't,
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia
for
one
second,
i
don't
see
any
problem
with
sending
them
through
405(g)
and
(h).
fine,
do
it.
but
i
don't
see
any
language
in
405(g)
and
(h)
that
says
you
can
go
that
route
only
if
you
first
refuse
to
comply
with
the
reg.
i
mean,
we
could
send
him
through
405(g)-(h)
reinforcement.
we
could
do
that.
you
would
have
complied
with
the
language.
most
of
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--cc(h).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
have
it
in
front
of
me.
i
have
it
in
front
of
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
didn't
say...
they
said
may,
which
is
what
is
bothering
me
about
this.
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
you
have
a
ripe
claim,
and
so
if
you
don't
have
a
ripe
claim
there's
just
no
problem.
you'd
simply
go
through
the
regular
process.
don't
we
have
to
decide
that
first?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
are
we
supposed
to
do,
assume
that
you
have
a
ripe
claim
and
then
decide
hypothetically?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
you
assume
it's
a
ripe
claim,
and
you
do
have
the
language
you
just
quoted
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument,
that
language
seems
to
say,
well,
we're
sorry,
this
is
an
antipreenforcement
review
statute.
that's
what
the
language
does.
so
even
if
it's
ripe,
you've
got
to
go
suffer
this
penalty
because
that's
what
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
response
to
that
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
say
bowen...
bowen
was
interpreting
not...
it
didn't
interpret
(h).
they
said
it
interprets
1395ii.
what
the
court
there
said
is,
mutatis
mutandis,
and
so
we
don't
have
to
reach,
it
says,
the
interpretation
of
(g)
or
(h).
we
have
to
interpret
what
the
words
mutatis
mutandis
meant,
i.e.,
the
equivalent
language
in
ii,
and
so
that's
what
they
were
interpreting
there.
we're
not
talking
about
ii,
we're
talking
about
cc.
we're
talking
about
something
else,
or
(g)
or
(h).
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
there's
no
doubt
the
government
was
talking
about
that
in
bowen,
but
the...
in
bowen,
michigan
academy,
but
what
the
court
said
was,
we
don't
have
to
reach
an
interpretation
of
(g)
or
(h),
because
we
can
deal
with
this
by
interpreting
the
equivalent
of
mutatis
mutandis
language
in
ii,
and
that
made
it
applicable
to
the
instance
where,
in
the
absence
of
the
court's
interpretation
of
ii,
there
would
be
no
review
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
different,
says
the
government,
because
you
get
review
eventually.
you
just
get
it
under
a
certain
hardship.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any
client--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--don't
you
have
any...
what
i
don't
understand
as
a
practical
matter
is,
there
must
be
somebody,
in
all
the
clients
that
you
have,
that
could
violate
some
minor
provision
of
this
thing
and
incur
a
fine
of
2.50
dollars
and
make
all
the
claims
that
you
want
to
make
in
the
context
of
litigating
the
legality
of
that
fine.
why
can't
you
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i...
i
thought
it
was
1395x.
is
there
some
provision...
i
mean,
it
has
three
things,
you
know,
which
you
can't
tell
what
they
are,
on
the
opposite
page,
on
page
14a,
and
in
looking
at
those
things
it
looked
as
if
some
of
them
might
be
sort
of
minor
things
you
could
violate,
incur
a
fine,
and
get
all
this
raised.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any...
i
can
understand
you're
upset
about
the
concern
that
you
have
to
be
terminated
from
the
program
before
you
can
test
its
legality.
is
there
any
other
concern?
is
there...
i
mean,
what
i
mean
by
that
is,
you...
suppose
that
you
could
have
preenforcement
review,
but
you
had
to
exhaust
procedure
before
the
secretary
before
you
got
it.
that
is,
you
had
to
write
to
the
secretary,
or
ask
the
secretary
for
a
hearing,
or
ask
the
secretary
to
consider
changing
the
regs,
or
present
your
objections,
get
a
decision
from
the
secretary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
any
objection
to
those
normal
kind
of
exhaustion
requirements?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
i
get
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
happens
under
a...
you
happen...
in
criminal
cases
even,
you
do
this
all
the
time.
you
say,
secretary,
i
don't
want
to
comply
with
a,
b,
c,
and
d.
the
secretary
says,
you
have
to.
you
say,
okay,
we'll
make
a
stipulation
here.
we'll
do
it
under
protest.
you
may
refuse
to
enter
into
the
agreement,
you
see,
because
we're
not
complying
with
a,
b,
c,
d.--
now,
we'll
agree...
we'll
appeal
all
that,
whether
you're
right,
you
have
to
do
it
or
not,
and
in
the
meantime,
we'll
go
ahead.
all
right,
you
see...
in
other
words,
you
do
it
the
same
way
like
a
suppression
of
evidence
case
or
something.
they
say,
we're
going
to
convict
you,
but
we
get
to
appeal
the
suppression
of
evidence.
isn't
there
a
way
of
doing
that,
making
an
agreement?
the
answer
is,
you
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
special
statutory
provisions
in
the
law
that
in
effect
say
that
no
action
to
recover
on
any
claim
arising
under
either
the
medicare
or
the
social
security
acts
can
be
brought
in
a
federal
court,
unless
the
claimant
has
first
presented
his
claim
to
the
agency.
now,
this
court
has
previously
held
that
those
provisions
govern
efforts
not
just
to
get
money,
but
also
an
effort
legally
to
attack
the
validity
of
an
agency
rule
or
regulation
in
general
attack
as
well
as
specific
claim.
by
insisting
that
all
such
claims
first
be
presented
to
the
agency,
the
statutory
provisions
go
beyond
the
ordinary
administrative
law
principles
of
rightness
or
exhaustion
of
remedies
which
do
require
an
initial
agency
presentation
often
but
not
always.
but
this
court’s
cases
seemed
to
say
that
a
more
absolute
rule
is
needed,
because
of
the
special
importance
of
giving
agencies
that
administer
such
massive
and
highly
complex
programs
as
medicare
or
social
security,
an
opportunity
to
consider
even
the
most
purely
legal
challenge
to
a
regulation
first,
before
court
becomes
involved.
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
is
an
association
of
nursing
homes.
it
challenged
the
lawfulness
of
certain
medicare
rules
and
regulations
without
first
going
to
the
agency.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
suit
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
a
more
recent
supreme
court
case
called
bowen
versus
michigan
academy
of
family
physicians
has
changed
the
law,
as
i
just
described
it,
and
instead
read
the
relevant
statutes
as
permitting
an
initial
challenge
to
the
lawfulness
of
a
medicare
regulation
in
federal
court.
after
reviewing
the
matter
this
court
by
a
five
to
four
majority
concludes
that
michigan
academy
did
not
change
preexisting
law,
where
that
question
is
simply
want
to
channeling
a
case
to
the
agency
first
rather
michigan
academy
applies
to
permit
an
initial
proceeding
in
a
district
court
only
where,
unlike
this
case,
the
alternative
would
be
no
review
at
all.
we
explained
all
this
at
some
detail
in
our
opinion.
our
conclusion
is
that
the
nursing
home
must
present
its
case
to
the
age
homes,
they
have
to
present
their
case
to
the
agency
first
before
they
can
go
to
court,
and
we
reversed
the
seventh
circuit’s
determination
to
the
contrary.
