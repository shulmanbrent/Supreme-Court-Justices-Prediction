justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
were
the
grounds
of
his
60(b)
motion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
he
was
saying
through
rule
60(b)
i
should
not
have
been
added
as
a
party
to
the
judgment
when
i
was
never
entered
as
a
party
to
the
lawsuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
wrong
on
your
first
argument,
if
adams
remains
the
prevailing
party
in
the
lawsuit,
then
do
you
agree
that
on
the
further
arguments
that
you
make,
you
can
win
here,
but
there
must
be
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court?
in
other
words,
this
could
go
back,
and
the...
adams
can
say,
now
we
want
to
do
it
right,
your
honor,
so
we're
going
to
serve
a
pleading
on
nelson,
which
hasn't
been
up
to
now
done.
you
were
talking
about
service
of
process,
but
there
hasn't
even
been
a
complaint
drawn.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
wanted
to
clarify
that.
so
you
recognize
if
you
lose
on
the
prevailing
party
thing,
then
it
does
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
he
can
fight
it
out
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
special
appearance
means
that
you
are
there
only
for
that
limited
purpose,
and
you're
not...
so
i
think
you
agree
with
what
justice
kennedy
just
said.
a
special
appearance
is
a
limited
appearance
simply
for
the
purpose
of
making
that
application,
and
not
subjecting
yourself
generally
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he's
doing
something.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
he'd
like
to
litigate
if
he
had
a
chance
to,
but
he...
well,
what
do
you
make
of
rule
21,
which
says
that
parties
may
be
added
by
order
of
the
court
on
motion
of
any
party
at
any
stage
of
the
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that
any
stage
of
the
action
doesn't
mean
after
judgment
is
rendered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
ms.
dixon,
you
told
me
they
wouldn't
have
to
bring
a
new
lawsuit,
that
assuming
you
lose
on
your
prevailing
party
interpretation,
that
mr.
nelson
stands
ready
in
this
very
case.
the
judgment
is
reopened.
the
question
is
whether
he
should
be
added
as
a
party
to
it.
he
could
stay
in
the
district
court.
he
doesn't
have
to
bring...
adams
doesn't
have
to
bring
another
action,
and
just
air
the
question,
is
he
responsible
for
attorney's
fees,
with
no
new
litigation,
or
are
you
changing
your
mind
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
would
adams
ever
want
to
start
a
brand
new
lawsuit
when
they
already
are
in
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
didn't
even
start
it.
i
mean,
mr.
nelson
started
the
lawsuit.
adams
didn't
start
the
lawsuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
dixon,
i
keep
wondering
why
you're
emphasizing
service
of
process.
no
complaint
was
ever
filed
in
the
district
court
naming
nelson.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
isn't
the
filing
of
a
complaint
a
little
more
basic
than
the
service
of
process
after
you
file
the
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
rule
15
relates
to
what
parties
must
do.
his
position,
i
take
it,
is,
he
never
comes
within
rule
15
because
he's
never
even
been...
no
complaint
has
ever
been
filed
against
him,
no
less
served
on
him,
so
rule
15
is
assuming
you
are
already
a
party,
and
then
states
your
obligations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
waive
a
question
when
you
are
not
in
the
litigation
at
all.
rule
15
is
framed
in
terms
of
somebody
who's
already
there...
can
you
have
an
amendment
that
relates
back
+/?
but
it
speaks
in
terms
of
parties,
people
who
have
party
status.
the
underlying...
the
root
problem
here
is,
it
sounds
a
little
bit
like
the
red
queen
who
says,
judgment
first,
and
then
you
could
state
your
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
it
say...
i
never
heard
of
a...
you
can
file
a
motion
for
leave
to
file
an
amended
complaint,
but
then
you
have
to
file
the
amended
complaint.
i
never
heard
of
a
motion
being
a
substitute
for
a
complaint
before.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
you
join
him
initially?
you're
arguing
issue
preclusion.
you're
saying
he
was
really
there
even
though
we
didn't
join
him.
that's
the
mystery.
why
didn't
you
join
him
in
his
individual
capacity?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
don't...
i'm
sure
it
isn't
your
practice
ordinarily
to
join
people
after
final
judgment
has
been
rendered.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
know,
you
have
only
one
case
that's
somewhat
in
point,
and
that's
the
fromson
case.
but
that's
when
the
corporation
represented
to
the
court
that
it
was
going
to
be
good
for
the
judgment,
that
it
would
have
the
wherewithal
to
pay,
so
you
didn't
have
to
join
the
principal,
and
then
it
turned
out
the
corporation
had
nothing.
here,
there
was
nothing
of
that
nature.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
the
court
in
fromson
itself
made
it
clear
that
what
drove
that
result
was
a
misrepresentation
that
had
made
to
the...
made
to
the
court,
with
the
principal's
knowledge,
that
the
corporation
would
be
good
for
the
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
brandeis
didn't
say
that
you
wouldn't
have
the
opportunity
then
to
be
heard.
he
said
you
could
be
heard
after
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
didn't
have
this
multiple
waiver
that
you're
arguing,
and
also
wasn't
it
true
in
that
case
that
at
least
the
plaintiff
was
arguing
the
surety
company
covered
two
defendants?
it
consented
to
be
there.
it
consented
to
being
a
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
i
never
understood
brandeis
to
be
saying
in
that
case
that
you
get
no
chance
to
put
on
your
defense
on
the
merits.
he
said,
you
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
what
ms.
dixon
says
that
she
wants,
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
let
her
make
her
defenses.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
all
i'm
saying
is,
you
cannot
use
american
surety
for
the
proposition
that
not
only
can
you
join
someone
after
the
judgment,
but
then
you
can
say,
and
we're
not
going
to
let
you
put
on
your
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
said,
i'm
not
here.
i'm
not
properly
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
not
arguing
the
merits,
because
the
basis
on
which
you
won
on
the
merits
don't
matter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
basis
on
which
you
won,
that
he
waived
his
right
to
defend
on
the
merits,
so
what
285
means
or
doesn't
mean
is
the
question
that
he
would
like
to
argue,
but
you
said...
so
the
point
that
you're
making
would
be
academic
if
you're
right
that
he's
waived
everything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
this
other
proceeding
that's
now
pending
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--has
it
been
stayed
pending
our
decision
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
other
feature
of
this
that
i'm
curious
about,
in
addition...
i
wondered
why
you
didn't
join
him
in
the
first
place,
then
at
the
end
i
take
it
your
concern
is
that
the
corporation
does
not
have
the
wherewithal
to
pay
this
judgment.
if
he
were
sole
shareholder,
and
the
assets
of
the
corporation
were
distributed
to
him,
you
could
go
after
those
assets
in
his
hands,
couldn't
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
understanding
was
that
in
a
bankruptcy
situation,
where
you
have
a
one
person
corporation,
that
that
shareholder,
you
can
go
after
the
shareholder
to
the
extent
that
he
got
a
distribution
from
the
corporation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
trial
court
he
wasn't
there,
and
the
problem
that
this
case
presents
is,
the
corporate
form
means
something,
and
your
argument
seems
to
suggest
that
any
time
you
have
a
judgment
against
a
one
person
corporation,
that
after
you
get
that
judgment,
you
can
join
the
sole
shareholder
if
you're
shaky
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
being
enough
in
the
corporate
till.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
may
well
be
right
ultimately,
but
as
i
understand
mr.
nelson's
position,
he
is
challenging
that
he
was
solely
in
control
of
the
litigation,
of
what
went
on,
that
he
is
raising
a
number
of
factual
questions
that
haven't
been
aired
before
any
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't.
the
corporation
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
he
was
not
a
party
to
that,
and
he
is
at
least
contesting
the
extent
to
which
he
had
control
over
the
litigation
because
the
corporation
changed
hands
in
between,
and
that
you
say
he
was
in
control.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
read
his
position
incorrectly
to
challenge
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
he
said,
here
i
am
not
because
i'm
not
a
party.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
case
presents
the
question
of
the
process
due
to
a
person
against
to
whom
a
claim
is
asserted
after
judgment
in
the
action
has
issued.
the
question
stems
from
patent
litigtion
between
two
corporations;
respondent
adams
usa
and
the
company
called
ocp.
adams
prevailed
and
the
court
ordered
ocp
to
pay
adams
attorney
fee.
adams
suspected
for
good
reason
that
ocp
might
not
have
the
money
in
its
corporate
till
to
pay
the
fee
award,
that
that
was
sought
payment
from
the
private
purse
of
the
president
and
sole
shareholder
of
ocp,
petitioner
nelson.
to
that
end,
adams
moved
to
amend
its
pleading
to
add
nelson
as
a
party.
adams
also
moved
to
alter
the
judgment
to
subject
nelson
to
personal
liability
for
the
fee
award.
the
istrict
court
granted
both
requests
simultaneously
thus
making
nelson
a
party
and
subjecting
him
to
judgment
at
a
single
stroke.
a
divided
panel
of
the
federal
circuit
correctly
noted
that
it
was
uncommon
to
add
a
party
after
the
entry
of
judgment
and
then
subject
that
party
to
immediate
liability.
but
the
panel
nontheless
affirmed
saying
that
nelson
was
not
prejudiced
by
the
unusual
time
and
manner
in
which
he
was
named
the
party.
in
the
federal
circuit’s
view
nothing
different
would
have
been
done
to
stay
off
the
fee
award,
had
nelson
been
named
as
a
party
in
his
personal
capacity
earlier
in
the
proceedings.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
we
reverse.
due
process
of
law
and
the
requirements
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
specially
rule
15
governing
pleading
amendments,
chart
our
course.
they
demand
that
a
party
joined
in
litigation
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
air
its
side
of
the
story
after
it
is
made
a
party
and
before
judgment
is
entered
against
it.
a
court’s
forecast
that
a
party
would
be
unsuccessful
in
a
voting
liability
that
any
defense
he
raises
would
fail
does
not
warrant
denial
of
an
actual
opportunity
to
defend.
we
express
no
view
on
the
likelihood
that
nelson
will
ultimately
be
liable
for
the
award
of
attorney
fees;
we
hold
only
that
the
district
court
acted
out
of
bounds
when
it
subjected
nelson
to
judgment
at
the
very
instant
it
added
him
as
the
party
to
the
proceeding.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
