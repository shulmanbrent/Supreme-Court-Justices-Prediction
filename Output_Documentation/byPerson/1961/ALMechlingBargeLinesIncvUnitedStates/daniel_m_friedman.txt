mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
just
to
summarize
very
briefly
what
the
government's
position
is
in
this
case
so
that
the
court
will
have
no
question
as
to
what
our
position
is.
we
think
first
that
the
district
court
correctly
dismissed
this
case
as
moot.
if
however
the
court
should
disagree
with
us
and
reach
the
merits
of
this
case,
we
didn't
concede
that
this
particular
order
cannot
stand
because
no
findings
were
made
in
issuing.
we
do
not
concede
that
before
the
commission
issues
temporary
fourth
section
orders
it
must
hold
a
hearing
as
the
appellants
alleged.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice
and
i
would
like
to
explain
now
the
procedure
which
the
commission
follows
in
entering
these
temporary
orders
because
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
both,
your
--
both
mr.
justice
black.
i'm
appearing
here
on
behalf
of
the
commission
and
the
united
states
both
of
whom
are
the
statutory
defendant
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
commission
recognizes
that
in
the
case
can
contest
at
least
--
in
contested
cases
it
must
make
findings
to
show
that
the
statutory
criteria
have
been
satisfied
before
it
issues
so-called
temporary
fourth
section
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
when
we
speak
of
the
pleadings,
this
is
what
i'd
like
to
come
to.
these
--
if
i
may
explain
a
little
as
to
how
the
commission
processes
these
cases
because
i
think
that
fact
will
indicate
the
basis
on
which
the
commission
can
make
this
kind
of
finding
in
this
type
of
case
without
holding
any
evidentiary
hearing.
the
statute
--
i'd
like
to
refer
just
briefly
at
the
outset
which
is
set
forth
at
the
pages
2
to
3
of
our
brief
initially
makes
it
unlawful
for
a
common
carrier
by
rail
or
by
water
to
receive
greater
transportation
for
a
shorter
haul
than
for
a
longer
haul.
but
it
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
commission
may
after
investigation
in
special
cases
authorize
a
lesser
charge
for
the
longer
distance
and
for
the
shorter
distance
providing
certain
circumstances
are
met.
now
under
the
commission's
regulations
a
carrier
which
is
seeking
relief
from
the
fourth
section
is
required
to
file
a
detailed
and
comprehensive
application
setting
forth
a
great
deal
of
data
relating
to
these
particular
criteria
specifically
whether
the
proposed
shorter
long-haul
rate
is
reasonably
compensatory,
the
reasons
why
they
are
seeking
this
relief,
and
showing
if
it
is
made
to
mean
water
competition
that
it
is
not
just
potential
water
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
advised
that
it
is
required
to
be
verified.
the
fourth
section
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i'm
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i'm
coming
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
the
notice
of
the
filing
of
one
of
these
applications
is
given
in
the
–
published
in
federal
registry
and
the
parties
have
15
days
within
which
to
file
a
protest.
now,
if
protests
are
filed,
they
are
frequently
very
lengthy
documents
themselves
and
then
the
railroads
are
given
generally
a
10-day
period
within
which
to
respond
to
these
protests.
now,
i
have
to
distinguish
two
situations.
if
there
is
no
protest
filed
and
--
let
me
come
back
a
minute.
the
commission
has
an
administrative
group
called
the
fourth
section
board
which
is
a
group
of
free
rates
specialist
within
the
commission
and
when
an
application
is
initially
filed,
it
is
referred
to
this
fourth
section
board
for
preliminary
evaluation.
if
no
protest
is
filed
to
the
application
of
the
expiration
of
the
15-day
period,
the
fourth
section
board
either
itself
acts
on
the
application
or
may
refer
it
to
the
commission
for
action,
if
there
is
no
protest
filed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice,
division
2.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
division
2.
now,
even
in
cases
where
no
protest
has
been
filed
the
commission
may
if
it
feels
in
cases
one
which
is
appropriate
for
a
hearing
set
the
matter
for
hearing.
this
is
not
the
usual
situations
admittedly.
most
of
these
fourth
section
applications
are
non-contested.
they're
pretty
routine
things.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
volume
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
say
probably
no
more
than
5%.
we
don't
have
the
figures
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
the
total
number
filed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
the
total.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
total
over
a
five
year
period
from
1956
to
1960
was
5755
applications.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
5%
mr.
justice,
5%,
about
200,
roughly
250
to
300.
the
number
varies
very
greatly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
approximately
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
roughly,
maybe
a
little
more
than
that.
we
don't
have
figures
on
that
basis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
ones
which
are
protested
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they're
very
difficult
cases
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
like
to
say
one
other
thing
that
the
commission
follows
a
practice
that
whenever
a
hearing
is
requested,
whenever
there
is
a
request
for
a
hearing
it
grants
a
hearing.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
every
protestant
does
not
request
a
hearing.
sometimes
they
are
satisfied
to
submit
their
protest
on
the
papers
filed
with
the
commission
and
do
not
request
a
hearing
and
that's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
we
deny
that
a
hearing
is
required.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
hearing
has
been
held
mr.
chief
justice.
hearings
were
held
on
the
application
for
permanent
relief
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
but
the
commission
does
not
follow
the
practice
of
holding
hearings
before
granting
the
application
for
temporary
authority.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
its
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
afraid
its
--
i
haven't
made
it
clear.
the
applicants
do
not
request
temporary
relief.
they
ask
for
relief
from
the
fourth
section.
they
don't
speak
in
terms
of
temporary
relief
and
the
commission's
practice
is
in
cases
where
they
set
the
matter
for
hearing,
where
they
feel
that
a
hearing
is
necessary,
they
may
or
may
not
grant
temporary
relief
pending
the
hearing
on
the
applications.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sua
sponte.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
they're
asking
for
relief
as
soon
as
possible.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that
--
that
means
permanent
relief
and
pending
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
this
is
--
this
is
implicit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
implicit
in
the
practice
that
has
grown
up
over
the
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
no
mr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
do
not
explicitly
ask
for
temporary
relief.
but
--
and
this
i
think
is
the
important
thing,
the
commission
in
deciding
whether
to
grant
temporary
relief
has
before
it
all
the
applications
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
yes
mr.
justice
and
in
this
context
that
the
commission
has
a
statute
which
provides
that
if
certain
conditions
are
met,
it
may
grant
relief
from
the
fourth
section.
and
it
has
frankly
from
the
very
beginnings
since
1887
recognized
that
there
may
be
situations
in
which
on
the
basis
of
the
filings
they
are
able
to
make
a
determination
that
the
statutory
standards
have
been
met.
and
however,
although
they
make
this
determination,
they
feel
they
want
to
have
the
opportunity
for
further
inquiry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
into
--
no,
they
did
not
in
terms.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
by
implication
they
have
in
view
of
the
settled,
established
practice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
rule
is
that
the
commission
grants
the
temporary
relief
until
such
time
as
the
final
order
is
entered
in
--
after
hearing
and
the
proceeding
for
permanent
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
may.
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
there
is
a
--
again
there
is
a
full
--
there
is
an
informal
full
investigation
by
the
commission
on
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
without
a
hearing.
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
one
thing
mr.
justice
black.
this
is
not
a
matter
that
takes
place
just
as
a
routine
thing.
the
commission
does
not
always
grant
temporary
relief
when
it
sets
a
matter
for
hearing.
there
are
many
instances
in
which
an
application
is
filed
for
relief.
there
is
a
protest
filed
even
by
--
on
many
occasions,
by
the
water
carriers
and
the
commission
does
not
grant
temporary
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that's
a
very
apt
analogy
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
(inaudible)
--
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
once
the
court
has
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
once
the
court
has
affirmed
the
case
is
over,
whereas
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
this
situation,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
the
case
is
not
over.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
since
the
outset,
since
1887.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
74
years.
the
first
annual
report
of
the
commission,
first
annual
report
specifically
refers
to
the
granting
of
temporary
relief
in
one
of
the
early
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
course.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
basis
on
which
the
commission
will
rest
its
findings
for
the
temporary
order
is
the
application,
the
lengthy
application
that
has
been
filed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
application
is
verified
and
i
think
it
does
mr.
justice
because
what
you
have
in
this
commission
procedure
is
a
lengthy
application,
lengthy
protest,
lengthy
response
and
then
on
the
basis
of
these
pleadings
the
commission
decides,
whether
it
will
or
will
not
grant
the
temporary
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
surely,
surely.
if
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
because
if
they
were
raised
any
substantial
issue
in
the
commission's
view
as
to
whether
the
statutory
criteria
was
satisfied,
it
would
not
grant
the
temporary
relief
as.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
mr.
justice
that
without
any
evidentiary
hearing,
the
commission
is
justified
in
granting
this
temporary
relief
if
it
is
able
to
make
the
findings
of
the
statutory
criteria
have
been
met.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
findings
upon
the
basis
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
what?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
supported
on
the
basis
of
the
papers
that
have
been
filed
with
the
commission.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
notice
for
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
didn't
--
they
--
the
protest
--
the
application
alleged
that
these
rights
were
designed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
order
was
in
effect
14
months.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
not
sure
of
that
mr.
justice
where
they
offered
any
affidavits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
could
have
filed
anything
they
wanted
in
their
protest.
they
could
have
filed
anything
they
wanted
in
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
justice,
again
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
again
i
have
tried
--
i
want
to
make
this
clear.
it
is
not
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
that's
not
focused
on
temporary
versus
permanent.
the
application
is
for
a
permanent
--
for
permanent
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
the
pre
--
on
a
--
everything
that
was
filed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
have
we
got
that
here?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
unfortunately
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
not
part
of
the
record
before
either
the
district
court
or
this
court
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
be
based
on
the
same
evidence
on
which
the
commission
in
the
past
has
determined
whether
to
grant
or
not
to
grant
temporary
relief.
that
is
whether
on
the
basis
of
all
the
material
file,
the
protests,
the
initial
application,
the
responses,
the
commission
is
able
to
conclude
that
the
statutory
criteria
has
been
satisfied,
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
mixed
these
questions
blow
in
fact,
there's
the
question
raised
whether
the
rights
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
reasonably
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
yes.
this
is
certainly
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
the
papers
but
if
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
the
papers
concludes
that
they
cannot
find
the
statutory
criteria
satisfied,
it
will
not
grant
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
there
were
issues
as
to
whether
the
right
was
reasonably
compensatory
as
to
what
in
(voice

--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pro
and
con.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
voluminous
material,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we
would
be
happy,
if
the
court
wishes
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
file
it,
but
let
me
explain
why
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
may
i
explain
why
they're
not
part
of
the
record.
the
reason
they're
not
part
of
the
record
is
the
appellants
filed
their
complaint
in
the
district
court.
and
after
they
had
filed
this
complaint
as
i'd
like
to
come
to
in
a
minute,
developments
occurred
which
in
our
view
rendered
the
case
moot
and
we
move
to
dismiss
and
the
district
court
granted
that
motion
so
that
there
was
never
any
reaching
below
of
the
merits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they're
not,
i'm
afraid.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
of
course.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
argued
that
the
case
–-
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
can't
answer
you
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
specifically.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i'm
trying
to
address
myself
to
the
temporary
order.
their
contention
was
that
the
case
was
not
moot
because
the
commission
had
a
continuing
practice
of
issuing
orders
without
findings
and
without
a
hearing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
was
not
so
limited.
it
was
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
against
--
of
course,
these
are
just
some
of
the
water
carriers?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
the
issue
they
raised,
and
the
district
court
and
we
think
properly
rejected
this
issue
because
--
i
would
like
to
explain
just
what
the
effect
of
this
water
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice
because
the
mere
allegation
that
even
though
the
particular
controversy
is
to
the
particular
orders
granted
moot,
that
the
agency
is
following
a
general
practice
in
other
cases
of
doing
the
same
thing
is
not
enough
to
create
a
justiciable
controversy.
this
is
what
we
think
this
court
has
repeatedly
held.
the
--
i
think
it's
very
important
to
emphasize
there
is
no
contention
by
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
did
--
they
did
not
but
once
--
once
the
railroads
--
i
--
something
that
i
think
has
to
be
made
clear
that
what
happened
in
this
case
after
the
railroads
had
received
the
temporary
authority
while
the
case
was
pending
in
court
and
i
want
to
emphasize
the
10
months
elapsed
between
the
time
that
the
commission
granted
this
temporary
authority
and
the
railroad
and
the
barge
lines
went
into
court.
after
they've
gone
into
court,
the
railroads
published
new
tariffs
which
reduced
the
short-haul
rates.
they
reduced
the
short-haul
rates
to
the
level
of
the
long-haul
rates
and
this
meant
that
the
differential
which
section
4
of
the
act
prohibits,
had
been
eliminated.
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
the
fourth
section
relief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely.
i'd
like
to
point
out
as
far
as
the
contention
has
been
made
that
there's
no
way
these
people
can
ever
get
a
judicial
determination
of
this
case.
there
have
been
cases
in
which
the
application
or
the
complaint
was
filed
in
the
district
court
the
day
on
which
the
order
became
effective,
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
sought,
and
the
effective
period,
effective
operation
of
the
commission's
orders
has
been
completely
stayed.
he
didn't
wait
to
do
that.
he
waited
10
months
before
coming
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
course.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
oh,
the
traders
has
recognized
this,
professor
sharpman
(ph)
work
points
out
that
this
practice
has
been
going
on
for
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice
their
own
affidavit
states,
they
all
--
their
own
affidavit
which
they
filed
in
the
district
court
states
that
there
were
nine
cases
that
they
referred
to
in
which
the
water
carriers
protested
grants
for
applications
for
fourth
section
relief
and
the
commission
granted
temporary
relief.
this
is
nothing
novel.
this
has
been
going
on
for
many
years
and
it
is
not
only
limited
to
protest
by
water
carriers
against
the
action
of
rail
carriers.
the
same
thing
can
happen
with
one
rail
carrier
against
another
rail
carrier.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
but
i
would
like
--
mr.
justice,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
in
this
context
of
section
4,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
protecting
the
water
carriers
against
the
rail
carriers
and
of
course
that
is
one
of
the
purposes
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
the
transportation
act
of
1940.
but
this
statute
is
not
so
limited.
this
statute
also
recognizes
that
the
commission
may
grant
relief
from
section
4
where
the
statutory
criteria
are
met.
if
i
may
put
it
a
little
differently,
the
barge
lines
have
an
inherent
advantage,
they
are
cheaper
and
the
rate
structure
must
recognize
that
inherent
advantage.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
after
the
protest,
after
the
application
has
been
filed,
the
protest
has
been
filed
and
the
response
has
been
filed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
the
--
that
is
not
my
interpretation
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
the
commission's
subtle
interpretation
for
70
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
have
to
say
mr.
chief
justice
they
do
not
attempt
to
decide
contested
facts
except
in
a
situation
where
on
the
basis
of
the
papers
before
them,
they
can
feel
they
can
do
that,
and
that
of
course
is
judicial
and
reviewable.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
where
that
--
they
never
do
it
unless
in
the
--
at
the
present
time
they
make
findings
which
show
that
the
statutory
standards
have
been
met.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
contested
factual
issues
if
i
may.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
have
to
--
i
would
have
to
qualify
to
this
extent
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
mr.
chief
justice,
they
feel
the
commission
concludes,
that
enough
had
been
shown
to
warrant
permitting
the
railroads,
to
put
these
rates
into
effect
for
that
because
of
what
is
in
the
application,
a
further
exploration
of
the
issue
is
necessary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
chief
justice
first
of
all,
let
me
say
they
could've
immediately
challenged
this
order
which
they
didn't
do
and
secondly,
that
the
statute
again,
i
come
back
that
the
statute
does
permit
the
commission,
does
permit
the
commission
to
grant
fourth
section
relief
if
it
concludes
that
the
rates
are
reasonably
compensatory
and
if
it
concludes
that
the
special
case
has
been
made
out.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
there
are
numerous
cases
in
which
the
commission
denies
temporary
relief
on
the
basis
either
--
there
have
been
cases
in
which
relief
is
denied
just
because
the
applicant
hasn't
made
out
a
sufficient
showing.
there
are
other
cases
in
which
on
the
basis
of
a
protest,
the
commission
denies
relief
because
there
are
issues
that
it
feels
it
cannot
properly
resolve
on
the
pleading.
i'd
like
just
to
--
my
time
is
coming
to
an
end
and
i
have
to
divide
my
time
with
counsel
for
the
railroad
appellees
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will
attempt
to
get
that
information.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know
either,
but
we
will
attempt
to
get
at
that
point,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will
attempt
to.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
will
attempt
to
get
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
get
--
i
will
attempt
to
get
this
information.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
frankly
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
a
matter
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction,
you
mean?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
primary
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
mr.
justice,
the
theory
of
the
damage
suit
as
i
understand
would
be
that
since
the
fourth
section
board
are
allegedly
--
it
would
be
invalid
be
--
for
the
lack
of
findings
that
in
that
situation
the
railroads
would
be
collecting
rates
illegally.
and
that
would
be
the
theory
of
the
damage
suit.
now
let
me
just
say
this
on
the
damage
suit,
a
point
has
been
raised
but
the
question
as
to
the
effect
of
the
commission's
order
on
any
claim
for
damages
is
an
issue
that
we
think
can
be
fully
litigated
in
the
damage
suit.
and
i
might
mentioned
that
the
issue
of
the
damage
suit
goes
to
the
question
of
mootness.
now,
this
court
has
frequently
held
that
you
cannot
collaterally
attack
an
order
of
the
commission
in
a
private
suit.
and
the
theory
of
those
cases
is
that
under
the
statute,
the
only
way
you
can
seek
such
review
is
by
a
proceeding
broad
and
a
three-judge
district
court
against
the
united
states.
now,
we
think
that
an
exception
that
perhaps
properly
be
made
in
the
narrow
case
where
a
proceeding
is
brought
to
get
such
relief
but
the
case
becomes
moot
before
there
is
any
decision,
because
in
that
situation
if
you
say
that
the
order
cannot
be
collaterally
attacked
in
the
damage
suit,
there
is
no
way
to
challenge
it.
but
we
think
that
in
a
sense
of
the
question
of
whether
the
chicken
or
the
egg
came
first,
you
might
say
the
case
is
not
moot
because
you
have
to
determine
that
alternately,
you
could
say,
it
can
be
determined
in
a
private
suit
because
the
case
is
moot.
and
we
think
the
latter
is
the
preferable
practice
because
the
possibility
of
this
damage
suit,
what
the
issues
are,
the
theory
of
it
are
all
wholly
conjectural
and
we
think
that
to
allow
life
to
be
breathed
in
to
a
controversy
otherwise
dead
because
of
the
possible
--
possibility
that
the
issue
may
be
raised
in
a
damage
suit
is
not
enough
to
cause
a
deviation
from
the
traditional
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
southern
pacific?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
southern
pacific
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
my
answer
mr.
justice
is
--
i'll
try
to
explain
it.
the
commission
following
the
mechling
case
in
330
when
there
was
a
readjustment
on
the
rates,
there
had
been
a
number
of
applications
filed
by
the
railroads
in
this
area.
in
some
instances,
the
commission
has
granted
temporary
fourth
section
relief
in
these
circumstances
are
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
contested
applications,
there
are
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
have
been
a
few
of
them,
one
or
two
of
have
been
taken
to
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
one
of
the
cases
it
was
and
one
of
the
cases
it
wasn't,
but
i
may
have
to
say
taken
to
court,
these
problems
do
not
arise
solely
in
the
chicago
grain
rate.
i
mean
they
may
come
up
throughout
the
country.
there
have
been
cases
in
the
chicago
area
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there's
one
case
involving
this
particular
traffic
which
was
taken
to
court
immediately
and
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
and
this
the
case
mr.
hayes
referred
throughout
in
the
seventh
circuit.
it
was
subsequently
dismissed
on
the
government's
motion.
there
have
been
other
cases
and
i
want
to
emphasize
as
far
as
this
practice
is
concerned,
there
had
been
other
cases
in
which
a
protest
has
been
filed
by
a
water
carrier
to
a
proposed
fourth
section
application
by
the
railroads
in
which
the
commission
has
denied
temporary
relief.
this
is
not
a
uniform
practice
that
every
time
the
railroads
seek
an
application
for
fourth
section
relief
and
as
a
protest
by
the
water
carriers,
and
automatically
the
commission
denies
it.
and
i
wanted
again
to
emphasize
that
if
the
commission
grants
this
temporary
relief
in
another
case
involving
different
rates
and
if
the
appellant
barge
lines
feel
they
are
injured
by
that
they
can
go
right
into
court
immediately.
they
can
go
right
in
and
seek
judicial
review,
but
of
course
these
rates,
this
differential
which
is
the
sole
subject
of
this
suit
cannot
be
automatically
reinstituted.
the
railroads
have
increased
--
i'm
sorry,
reduced
the
short-haul
rates
to
the
level
of
the
long
haul-rates.
now,
if
the
railroads
wanted
to
reinstitute
this
differential
again,
they
would
have
to
file
a
whole
new
application,
new
protest,
different
facts,
the
commission
might
or
might
not
grant
the
temporary
relief
and
the
statute
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
refer
to
this,
i
just
want
to
say
it
brief
and
the
statute
says
after
investigation
the
commission
may
grant
relief.
and
section
2
of
the
statute
specifically
says
after
hearing
that
the
commission
may
grant
the
temporary
relief
after
investigation,
but
if
the
rate
has
been
reduced,
if
the
long
haul-rate
has
been
reduced
to
meet
water
competition,
and
later
on
the
railroad
wants
to
increase
it
again,
then
the
commission
may
only
permit
that
if
after
hearing,
not
after
investigation,
after
hearing,
the
commission
finds
that
the
increase
has
not
been
the
result
of
the
elimination
of
water
competition.
this
is
a
very
significant
thing
and
its
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
certainly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
1946
to
1947.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
are.
there's
no
--
i
don't
think
there's
a
practice
in
the
sense
of
the
southern
pacific
situation.
let
me
just
briefly
mention
that.
that
was
the
commission
order
directed
to
a
specific
discrimination
in
one
instance,
to
a
specific
series
of
rates
that
were
unreasonable.
and
the
commission
ordered
us
--
the
statute
then
existed
was
limited
in
durations
for
two
years,
and
by
the
time
the
case
has
got
to
this
court,
the
two
years
have
expired.
and
the
court
said
those
cases
were
not
moot.
those
cases
were
not
moot
because
the
practice
was
capable
of
repetition.
but
the
practice
wasn't
the
practice
of
the
commission
of
generally
issuing
orders,
prohibiting
discrimination
with
the
precise
thing
involved
in
that
case.
that
is
that
the
same
type
of
discrimination
at
the
expiration
of
the
two
years
could
be
resolved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely.
whereas
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
the
complaint
against
the
repetition
of
the
practices
is
only
not
that
--
in
this
particular
rate
situation
there's
going
to
be
some
injury,
but
that
at
some
other
time
and
some
other
case,
the
commission
may
do
the
same
thing
and
these
people
maybe
injured,
and
we
don't
think
that
is
enough
to
breathe
life
into
this
controversy
over
this
particular
order.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
no
mr.
justice,
this
is
not
going
to
affect
the
old
rates.
this
--
what
this
did
--
what
this
adjustment
was,
you
had
a
series
of
rates
prior
to
1950
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
reduced
the
short-haul
rate
to
the
level
of
the
long-haul
rate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
have
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
just
want
to
explain
why
it
didn't
because
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
those
dates
are
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
some,
mr.
justice,
that
i'm
--
perhaps
if
given
the
false
impression,
i
would
say
that
the
action
of
the
railroads
in
eliminating
the
differential
did
give
the
appellants
the
relief
they
were
asking
for
because
the
only
relief
they
could
seek
was
a
relief
against
an
order
which
permitted
a
violation
of
the
fourth
section.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
against
--
no
i'm
going
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
just
don't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
the
new
order
mr.
justice
eliminated
any
violation.
once
the
new
rates
were
in
effect,
there
was
nothing
the
appellants
could
complain
about
except
they
could
protest
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'd
have
to
say
they
would
not
be
returned
to
this
original
level
to
be
--
the
original
relationship.
they
would've
both
been
reduced.
they
would
have
both
been
reduced.
do
you
see
they
originally
reduced
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
they
have
been
before
then.
mr.
daniel
m.

no,
it's
the
relationship.
it's
the

mr.

because
mr.

mr.

yes.
mr.

the

sir,
if
i
may
draw
the
analogy
of
the
rates
that
previously
has
been
at
this
level.
let's
assume
this
is
the
long
rate
and
this
is
the
short
rate
and
then
the
long
rate
was
pushed
down
below
the
level
of
the
short
rate.
now,
the
effect
of
the
adjustment
made
by
the
railroads
in
1960
was
to
push
the
short-haul
down
again,
so
you
have
the
same
relationship
at
a
different
amount,
at
different
dollar
and
cent
amount.

there
have
been
cases
which
have
done
it.
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.

thank
you.
