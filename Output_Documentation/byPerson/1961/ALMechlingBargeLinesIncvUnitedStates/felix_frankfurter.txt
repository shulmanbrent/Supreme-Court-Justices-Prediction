justice
felix
frankfurter
apart
from
what
you
said
generally
about
recurring,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
or
in
the
history
of
this
litigation
that
would
indicate
that
this
long-short
haul
deferential
will
be
restored?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
what
you're
complaining
of
would
again
be
indulged
to
you
by
the
railroad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
take
your
time,
mr.
hayes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
patience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hayes,
does
the
commission
automatically
give
temporary
relief
under
section
4?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
the
temporary
relief
to
which
you
refer
was
on
the
basis
of
a
prima
facie
showing
that
relief
was
at
least
called
for,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
what
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
made
it
quite
clear,
but
i
repeat
my
question.
temporary
relief
under
section
4,
which
constitutes
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
all
aspects
of
the
commission's
functions
and
duties,
are
not
granted
--
did
not
grant
it
automatically
but
is
granted
on
the
showing
made
by
the
railroads
for
relief.
now,
there's
capacity
or
opportunity
for
protest
even
as
a
temporary
relief,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
asking
is
could
there
be
protest
against
granting
temporary
relief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
protest
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
so
that
the
issue
is
before
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
temporary
relief
which
you
say
is
temporary
relief
which
change
the
situation
which
you
say
adversely
mean
properly
if
you
were
going
to
show
under
permanent
--
on
the
nearest
permanent
disposition
of
application
under
section
4
was
based
on
an
exercise
of
the
commission's
duty
and
function,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
i'm
not
saying
it
was
rightful
or
wrongful.
i'm
saying
it
was
their
duty
to
act
on
it
and
they
didn't
do
it
automatically
but
they
acted
on
what
was
before
them,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
i
don't
understand
it.
i
thought
you
agree
that
the
commission
has
power
to
grant
temporary
relief
under
section
4.
does
it
or
doesn't
it
have
that
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
may
be
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether,
as
a
matter
of
legal
power
--
even
--
you
know,
even
courts
are
sometimes
wrong.
so
the
commission
may
be
wrong
in
its
understanding
of
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
the
commission
does
have
power
under
application
for
relief
under
section
4.
i
repeat,
among
the
most
teasing
of
all
questions
that
come
before
the
commission
to
grant
temporary
relief
on
the
showing
made
before
you
which
you
and
i,
if
we
were
on
the
commission,
might
not
do.
but,
they
weren't
traveling
outside
their
authority,
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
if
--
did
you
--
why
didn't
you
move
in
and
enjoin
them
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
means
that
at
all
events
for
that
purpose,
the
commission
was
acting
with
a
non
--
with
non
--
an
unreviewable
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
regard
an
unreviewable
exercise
of
authority
necessarily
an
illegal
exercise
of
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
tried
to
come
up
here?
did
you
try
to
get
that
--
what
you
regard
erroneous
decision
of
the
three
judges
to
get
--
to
be
reviewed
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
recurring
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
recurring
means
how
often
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
carrier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
carrier
withdrawing
them.
the
carrier
withdrawing
them
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
don't
think
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
due
process
requires
hearing
in
all
proceedings
before
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
oh,
you
don't
think
it
requires
it
as
a
matter
of
due
process
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
why
do
you
say
that
--
the
history
of
the
commission,
the
history
of
this
court
with
reference
to
commission
action,
is
full
of
determination,
that
the
most
abrupt,
the
most
limited,
the
most
empty
hearing
will
suffice
on
it
at
all.
no
one
has
more
often
mr.
hayes
expressed
this
satisfaction
with
the
kind
of
findings
the
commission
made,
but
no
one
than
i
have,
but
no
one
is
more
aware
than
i
am,
what
a
tickly
subject
that
is
and
how
disputatious
the
subject
matter
is,
and
how
often
this
court
has
divided
with
the
findings
of
adequate
or
inadequate,
and
you
blow
this
up
into
a
great
constitutional
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
water
carriers
don't
come
to
these
problems
like
in
essence
though
they
have
never
heard
of
the
issues
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
they're
doing
--
you've
been
concerned
with
these,
i
don't
know
for
how
many
years.
when
was
the
case
which
you
stated
here,
1947?
1946?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
all
i'm
--
that
wasn't
--
that
remark
was
in
the
record
as
it
suggested,
that
the
poor
innocent
people
barge
the
water
carriers
--
didn't
know
anything
about
it,
and
they
only
had
15
days
within
which
to
acquaint
themselves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
innocence
on
either
side?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
aren't
new
issues
either
for
you
or
the
railroads,
or
the
icc.
i'd
like
to
repeat,
nobody,
nobody,
i
believe
is
more
exactly
a
finding
and
easily
ascertainable
and
readable
findings
of
the
commission
than
i
did
for
nearly
40
years.
but
that's
not
–
that
doesn't
determine
my
view
in
regard
to
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
been
instructed
by
this
court
that
we
need
not
take
concession
regarding
questions
of
law
by
any
agency
of
this
government
not
even
the
solicitor
general.
i
have
been
so
instructed
by
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
its
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
it's
due
process,
mr.
hayes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
ask
you
only
one
more
question,
mr.
hayes.
am
i
to
infer
from
what
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
they
failed
to
make
findings
only
in
section
4
cases
that
affect
water
carriers?
that
they
treat
water
carrier
--
section
4
applications
differently
from
the
conventional
section
4
applications
as
we
see
in
railroads
and
on
shippers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
trouble
me
greatly,
if
that
was
the
contention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
wanted
--
numerically,
how
many
section
4
applications
have
there
been
in
the
course
of
the
year
on
the
average,
have
you
any
figures
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
water
carriers
versus
rail
carriers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
section
4
applications.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
with
section
4
is
a
national
policy
isn't
some
--
isn't
just
some
agreement
between
parties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
particular
division
of
the
commission
which
concerns
itself
with
fourth
section
application?
justice
felix
frankfurter
2?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
volume
of
protested
application?
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
for
some
normally
--
i
don't
mean
normal,
overall
period
of
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
5%
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
total?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
total?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
2500
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
complicated
cases,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
protested
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
now
the
position
of
the
commission
that
even
in
those
cases
a
hearing
is
required?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
hearing
was
requested
and
the
matter
was
set
for
hearing.
the
matter
was
set
for
hearing
on
the
application
for
permanent
relief
and
now
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
--
no,
mr.
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sua
sponte.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
when
an
application
is
made
for
relief
on
what
--
in
many
instances,
it's
a
stringent
--
well,
i
know
it's
properly
stringent,
restriction
that
in
order
to
give
the
commission
that
on
the
face
of
things,
the
commission
suspects
or
believe
or
prophesize
that
there
will
be
relief.
but
it
does
--
it
wants
to
have
ample
of
time
in
which
to
confirm
or
to
verify
or
to
validate
its
impression,
and
yet
it
is
sufficiently
made
out
on
the
surface
that
they
give
temporary
relief
so
that
they
have
ample
time
to
determine
whether
relief
should
be
withdrawn
or
made
permanent,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
is
the
tenor
of
my
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
all
i
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
the
procedure
which
you
outlined
which
negated
the
notion
that
the
commission
goes
on
a
joy
ride
and
the
commission
never
since
its
existence
have
had
its
imminent
minutes
ever
set
on
this
court,
how
long
has
this
procedure
been
in
existence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
we've
got
--
we're
sitting
here
in
judgment
on
a
procedure
which
has
had
nearly
hundred
years
--
nearly,
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
far
as
i
know,
wasn't
until
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
any
limitation
was
put
on
the
length
of
time
on
an
injunction
of
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
it
--
is
it
in
the
clerk's
--
in
this
clerk's
office?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
it
--
where
we
--
is
it
part
of
the
record,
so
that
we
can
look
at
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
of
these
materials
--
these
materials
are
not
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
have
been
great
details
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
make
(inaudible),
a
judgment
of
that
sort.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
haven't
got
it.
we
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
--
maybe
we
can
but
as
i
remember
the
decision
of
this
court
that
what
is
in
the
private
--
in
the
files
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
not
put
in
record,
they
have
to
take
in
judicial
notice
of.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
whether
i
can
look
at
them,
much
as
i'd
like
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
your
motion
for
a
dismissal
on
the
score
of
mootness
contest
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
i
don't
see
why
then
they
couldn't
have
been,
as
part
of
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
part
of
that
issue
of
moot
ness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
why
they
couldn't
have
been
solicited
however
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they're
not
here,
that's
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
hope
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
you
that
--
for
clarification
and
not
interruption.
do
i
understand
you
that
what
mr.
hayes
now
claims
to
have
been
unconstitutionally
issued
temporary
relief
from
section
4
was
in
operation
against
his
clients
for
10
months
before
he
moved
to
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
potentiality
--
the
potentiality
of
a
temporary
relief
from
an
application
on
file
before
the
commission
to
which
response
made
--
was
made,
the
potentiality
that
a
temporary
relief
maybe
granted
is
a
well-known
fact
to
all
counsel
who
deal
in
these
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
we
can
as
that
--
we
can,
depend
on
what's
the
conviction
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
friedman,
before
you
move
on
to
this
crucial
point.
i'll
say
to
you
what
i
said
to
mr.
hayes
that
the
charge
that
the
commission
either
discriminatory,
in
these
short
hauling
cases
against
the
barge
lines,
the
water
carriers
generally
and
thereby
implied
these
--
favors
railroads,
that's
what
concerned
me
greatly.
what
i'd
like
to
know
is
whether
it's
an
impossible
task
or
too
burdensome
a
demand
to
ask
from
the
commission
the
figures
of
short
hauling
cases
between
railroads
which
are
most
of
the
cases
--
if
my
memory
doesn't
(inaudible),
but
it
sometimes
does,
do
often
does,
that
to
come
here
and
in
lower
court,
most
of
them
are
not
water
carrier
cases,
but
in
the
railroad
controversy.
i'd
like
to
know
the
figures
of
railroad
short
hauling
controversies
as
against
railroad
versus
water
carrier
controversies
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
an
--
in
a
reasonable
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
if
that
isn't
--
whether
those
figures
are
available.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
internal
railroad
controversies
are
usual
--
are
contested,
are
they
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that's
what
the
railroad
is
about.
that
is
the
origin
of
this
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down
mr.
friedman,
i
think
it's
very
important
in
view
of
what
mr.
hayes
is
contending
that
this
is
what
he
calls
a
pattern,
bearing
on
what,
after
all,
is
the
question
before
us,
whether
this
case
is
moot,
that's
the
real
issue
in
this
case.
now,
its
bearing
on
that,
if
there
is
a
pattern
by
which
i
understand,
is
it
like
the
–
what
is
it
--
the
case
in
219,
a
recurring
--
that
while
it
said
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
southern
pacific
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
this
is
recurring
thing
while
the
slate
is
clean
today,
it
was
rubbed
off.
it's
been
scribbled
on
again
and
again
and
it
will
be
scribbled
on
tomorrow.
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
history
has
been
since
the
case
in
330
in
this
very
--
regarding
this
very
water
carrier,
what
the
--
because
that
to
me
seems
to
have
bearing
on
whether
this
is
just
a
cat
and
mouse
business,
and
what
in
effect
mr.
hayes
is
saying
here
more
politely
that
this
is
a
way
by
which
the
commission
really
sought
to
get
out
of
the
courts.
and
next
week
we'll
do
the
same
hanky-panky.
and
therefore
the
case
isn't
moot.
i
put
this
in
very
crude
language
in
order
to
get
an
elegant
relevant
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
contested,
contested
applications?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
the
grants
taken
to
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
the
commission
--
the
commission's
order
found
wanting
in
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
reference
to
this
particular
--
this
grain
effect,
the
generic
term,
these
grain
commodities
affecting
this
carriage,
the
claim
is
that
there
was
a
recurring
phenomenon
sufficient
to
make
out
a
pattern
or
has
been
suggested
from
debenture
system,
so
that
equity
properly
doesn't
close
it's
eyes
and
says
we're
going
to
guard
against
this
bifurcating
it
in
the
future.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
rate
conditions
change,
commodity
conditions
change
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
traffic
conditions
change,
these
are
really
essentially
--
certainly
when
there's
a
--
this
largest
span
of
time
as
--
when
was
it,
350
--
1946
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
these
are
ad
hoc
situations,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
like
our
labor
cases
where
an
unfair
labor
practice
is
safeguarded
against
future
repetition
by
letting
injunction,
the
restraint
in
the
commission
--
the
court
order
stand
although
the
particular
thing
has
been
collected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i
want
to
ask
you
this
question,
if
a
person
goes
in
to
the
united
states
district
court,
claiming
that
in
order
of
the
or
relief
under
section
4
to
be
very
specific,
was
either
invalid
statutorily
or
offensive
as
a
due
process
of
law,
and
seeks
to
enjoin
that
order,
may
a
district
court
give
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
the
enforcement
of
that
order
until
the
litigation
in
the
district
court
on
the
claim
of
invalidity,
etcetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
doubts
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
customary
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
hold
a
situation,
the
relief
isn't
--
the
fruit
of
the
relief
isn't
garnered
until
after
the
litigation
enjoining
a
contested
illegal
order
is
disposed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
10
months
here
--
mr.
hayes
will
have
a
say
on
that.
i'll
take
it,
for
10
months
no
such
relief
in
the
courts
against
the
allegedly
unconstitutional
relief
that
was
given
was
taken
or
sought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
correct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
repeating
--
just
the
repeat
those
very
words
again
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
hayes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
always
--
in
this
--
you're
here
now
proving
that
if
you
don't
get
relief
in
the
lower
court,
you
can
come
to
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
don't
get
relief
in
this
court
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they're
the
counsel
and
they're
not
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
don't
read
the
sentence
before
the
one
you
read
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
finish
the
sentence
if
you
like
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
formal
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
you
didn't
read
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
alright,
then
i
didn't
hear
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
despite
(inaudible)
the
statute
as
the
solicitor
general
considered?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
order
then,
it
is
focused,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
--
i
don't
mean
that
the
order
has
illegally
put
the
slit
--
i
mean
by
the
change
in
rate
condition
of
the
order
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
--
you
tell
us
for
the
future
but
not
for
the
past.
you
are
arguing
that
even
if
it's
settled
it
for
the
future,
it
doesn't
settle
it
for
this
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
order
--
if
the
case
is
moot,
then
i
should
think
according
to
our
usual
practice,
the
underlying
legal
document
ought
to
be
vacated
to
which
the
order,
i
think
that
follows
as
a
consequence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
follows
the
consequence
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
at
the
moment,
i
see
no
difference
in
saying
a
proceeding
which
seeks
to
challenge
an
existing
order
of
administrative
agency
reviewable
in
court
and
the
court
finds
a
review
of
that
order
not
within
its
jurisdiction,
loosely
speaking
because
it's
moot.
i
should
think
the
same
line
of
reasoning
which
vacate
that
which
is
now
not
subject
to
review
because
of
change
in
circumstances.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
hope
you'll
agree
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
you
might
embrace
that
suggestion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
handsome
present
there
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
thought
was
not
a
present.
thoughts
are
not
present.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
have
they
been
enforced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
the
old
rates,
not
the
--
what's
the
original
date
of
the
old
rates,
the
citing
date
of
the
old
rate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
are
now
enforced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
they
restored?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
lowered
short-haul
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
hayes,
speaking
for
one
member
of
the
court,
that
this
--
the
solicitor
general
does
not
concede
that
a
hearing
is
required,
he
protests
that
claim
and
so
far
as
i'm
advised,
he
rightly
protests
that
claim.
