justice
potter
stewart
this
--
on
this
point
that
you
find
yourself
an
issue
with
your
adversary
don't
you,
that
even
in
this
case,
there's
a
claim
that
this
objection
is
--
has
a
religious
basis,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
constitutional
scope
to
be
given
at
least
to
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
no
please,
you
may
resume.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
court
should
try
to
formulate
an
answer
to
the
questions
you're
now
asking,
wouldn't
we
be
thinking
a
bit
with
the
first
amendment
ourselves?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
right
at
the
early
part
of
the
argument
in
this
case,
you
quoted
a
phrase
or
two
from
that
what
you
said,
you
thought
expressed
continuously
the
essence
of
mr.
peter's
case.
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
tell
what
page
--
where
is
that
to
be
found?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
did
he
indicate
he
had
faith
in,
his
fellow
human
being?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
see
that
he
as
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
the
solicitor
general
the
word
--
the
word
religious
it
says
that
we
have
to
deal
with
these
cases
but
--
but
what
do
you
mean
by
the
fact
that
his
conscientious
objector
was
based
on
his
religious
training
and
belief.
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
something
extra
human?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
asking
about
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
just
talking
to
this
man,
what
his
conscientious
objector
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
about
that
but
how
about
this
man?
but
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
conscientious
objection
based
on?
justice
potter
stewart
based
on
his
--
based
on
his
love
of
his
fellow
man?
justice
potter
stewart
on
what?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that's
--
recommendation
of
this
case,
that's
the
reason
i'm
asking
the
question.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
the
foundation
of
your
difference
in
this
area
between
you
and
the
solicitor
general.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
that
can
help.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
he
say
or
suggest
that
he
was
skeptical
about
the
existence
of
any
--
any
divinity.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
so
it
--
that
really
doesn't
help.
i'm
just
asking
you,
what
this
man's
conscientious
objection
was
based
upon.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
he
--
didn't
--
he
didn't
claim
any
belief
in
divinity,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
one
or
many,
he
did
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
to
say
one
single
supreme
being.
justice
potter
stewart
a
and
maybe
many
others
--
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
someday
you'd
believe
in
all
the
greek
gods
would
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
you're
suggesting
that
the
duty
of
congress
if
it
exempts
anybody
at
all
on
the
basis
of
conscientious
objection
to
--
to
exempt
the
whole
spec
--
spectrum
of
first
amendment
beliefs?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suggest
that
if
you're
right,
then
congress
can't
draft
anybody
if
they
exempt
anybody
because
i
can
say
it's
my
religion
that
i
don't
believe
in
war
and
it's
also
part
of
my
religion
that
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
why.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
just
don't
believe
in
war
and
i
don't
want
to
be
drafted
and
that's
my
religion.
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
guess
that
99
out
of
100
people
would
sincerely
want
--
not
want
to
be
drafted.
justice
potter
stewart
well
again,
i
know
we're
both
talking
about
something
that's
very
difficult
to
define.
as
i
gather,
you
--
your
definition
of
religion
doesn't
necessarily
--
you
have
a
definition
of
religion
which
does
not
require
any
belief
in
divinity
of
any
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
or
how
about
any
divinity,
any
kind
of
divinity?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
a
devoted,
dedicated,
sincere,
all
out
belief
in
one
of
the
--
in
one
of
the
classical
philosophies
such
as
stoicism
or
epicureanism?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
any
religious
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
let
me
--
i'm
drafted
and
i'm
--
i'd
say
in
the
--
in
my
hypothesis
i'm
very
sincere
and
i've
dedicated
and
devoted
my
life
to
being
an
epicurean.
and
i'd
say
i
don't
want
to
be
drafted
because
the
mattresses
aren't
soft
and
the
food
isn't
good
and
there's
not
good
music,
and
things
like
that
in
the
army.
and
because
of
my
epicureanism,
i'm
conscientiously
opposed
in
the
military
service
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
but
how
about
hypothesis,
i
am
sincere.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i'm
an
epicurean
by
definition.
now,
is
that
religious?
justice
potter
stewart
no
but
i
--
i'm
giving
a
hypothetical
line.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
perfectly
systematic,
classical
in
philosophy.
justice
potter
stewart
the
difference
is
your
man,
mr.
seeger
has
affirmatively
said
that
he
is
very
skeptical
about
the
existence
of
any
divinity
of
any
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
skeptical.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
believe
in
that.
i
don't
believe
in
any
divinity.
justice
potter
stewart
well
say
then
you
don't
believe
in
divinity
if
you
don't
know
and
you
don't
in
one.
justice
potter
stewart
a
nonbeliever.
i
don't
think
he's
different
from
a
disbeliever.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know
you
don't
believe
in
the
divinity,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
skeptical
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
didn't
based
on
his
conscientious
objection
upon
any
belief
in
any
kind
of
a
divinity,
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
call
it
that,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
quite
a
way
your
conscience
comes
from.
justice
potter
stewart
what
(inaudible)
do
you
think
if
any
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
in
the
free
speech
area
of
the
first
amendment,
where
we
have
recognized
the
congress
made
accommodations
in
terms
of
the
national
security
and
the
right
to
remain
silent
which
should
be
given
by
the
first
amendment
written
literally
in
appeal
to
communist
investigation.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
think
they
--
i
like
to
put
your
answer
in
this
way.
i
don't
think
there
can
be
an
accommodation
between
one
type
of
religion
and
another
type
of
religion.
that
line,
i
don't
think
can
be
drawn.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
becomes
the
fifth
amendment
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
which
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
--
now,
is
it
your
claim
basically
that
if
congress
exempts
anybody
at
all
from
military
service,
then
they
have
to
go
to
the
--
on
the
basis
of
their
beliefs.
then
they
have
to
go
the
entire
scope
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
the
whole
spectrum
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
either
political
or
moral
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought
the
first
amendment
protects
all
those
things.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
wouldn't
that
be
an
invidious
discrimination
to
exempt
people
only
for
the
reason
of
religious
beliefs
and
not
because
of
their
political
or
any
religious
beliefs.
justice
potter
stewart
first
amendment
protects
all
of
those
beliefs
and
disbeliefs.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i'm
asking
what
your
argument
is.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
it
was
under
the
establishment.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
that's
not
a
free
exercise,
that's
a
due
process
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
other
words,
if
you're
right
on
the
free
exercise
argument
then
the
government
has
an
obligation,
absolute
constitutional
obligation
to
exempt
everybody
from
military
service
whose
religious
convictions
or
whatever
nature
make
them
oppose
they
military
service.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
correct?
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
a
free
exercise
claim.
that's
a
due
process
claim,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
you're
right,
is
this
--
it
appears
with
this
person's,
mr.
seeger's
free
exercise
in
religion,
then
it
would
follow
i
should
think
that
the
government
--
the
congress
has
an
absolute
constitutional
obligation
to
exempt
everybody
from
military
service
who
is
religiously
opposed
the
military
service.
otherwise,
it
would
impair
that
person's
free
exercise,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
a
denial
of
equal
protection,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
are
you
reading
from?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
somebody
who
believed
in
a
goddess
or
in
many
goddesses
and
gods
would
be
literally
within
the
terms
of
the
statute
that
congress
pass,
wouldn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
many
other
supreme
being.
it
doesn't
say
a
single
exclusive
one
supreme
being.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
matter
of
the
literal
reading
of
the
language
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
one
supreme
being
or
a
single
supreme
being
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
thought
there
was
a
peak
order
in
the
gods
of
the
greek
mythology,
wasn't
there?
there
was
one.
there
was
one
supreme
and
the
others
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
--
that's
it
--
and
yet
that's
a
--
kind
of
any
religion
of
three
supremacies.
justice
potter
stewart
consider
divinity
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
there's
whole
three
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
and
i
just
have
it
before
me
here,
what
they
know
was
that
that
the
record
could
support
a
substantial
foundation
for
the
conclusion
that
the
--
mr.
peter's
conscientious
objection
being
drafted
to
military
service
is
based
upon
a
merely
personal,
moral
code.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
i
suppose
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
say
that
that
was
the
--
that
that
was
a
merely
a
personal
moral
code.
that
is
not
involved
the
dictation
by
your
obligation
to
a
divinity,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
--
as
you
say
i
think
the
government
agrees
with
you
–-
justice
potter
stewart
insofar
as
your
argument
does
but
i
don't
think
it
argues
with
you
as
insofar
as
what
the
ninth
circuit
understood
with
that.
justice
potter
stewart
anthropomorphic
means
that
a
man
is
a
god
in
the
form
of
man
or
man
which
is
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
an
identity
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
being
questioned
around
rather
consulting
the
dictionary.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
the
record
does
support
a
conclusion
that
he
believed
in
a
higher
power,
extra
human.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
turn
now
to
the
material
appearing
on
page
73
and
83
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
it
was
–
where
does
the
statement
appear
to
which
you
just
have
referred?
justice
potter
stewart
127,
thank
you.
