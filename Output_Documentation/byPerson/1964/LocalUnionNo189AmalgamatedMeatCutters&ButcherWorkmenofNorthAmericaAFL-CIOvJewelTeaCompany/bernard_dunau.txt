mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
chicago
area,
the
employment
terms
of
butchers
and
meat
departments,
all
governed
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
entered
into
between
meat
cutters
locals
and
the
food
store
operators.
central
to
the
question
in
this
case
is
a
provision
in
those
agreements
which
read
like
this.
market
operating
hours
shall
be
9
a.m.
to
6
p.m.
monday
through
saturday
inclusive.
no
customer
shall
be
served
who
comes
into
the
market
before
or
after
the
hours
set
forth
above.
it
is
said
that
this
agreement
is
a
contract
in
restraint
of
trade
and
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
on
the
merits
of
this
claim,
there
are
two
ways
into
this
problem,
one,
through
the
national
labor
relations
act.
in
our
view,
based
upon
the
findings
and
the
record,
the
limitation
upon
marketing
operating
hours
is
with
respect
to
wages,
hours,
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
it
is
a
mandatory
bargaining
subject.
and
it
is
our
position
that
an
agreement
upon
a
mandatory
bargaining
subject
is
not
within
the
coverage
of
the
sherman
act.
an
agreement
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
is
not
an
agreement
in
restraint
of
trade.
if
we
first
establish
and
we
have
to
establish
by
a
record
showing
what
this
agreement
is
about,
if
we
first
establish
that
it
is
mandatory
bargaining
subject,
then
it
is
our
position
that
under
no
circumstances
does
it
come
within
the
sherman
act.
when
one
says
it's
being
used
as
a
façade,
i
think
you
will
go
to
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
mandatory
bargaining
subject.
i
think
that
might
be
relevant
to
the
ascertainment
whether
the
agreement
is
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
or
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
or
is
in
restraint
of
trade.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
once
you
establish
that
it
is
upon
a
mandatory
bargaining
subject,
then
nothing
else
is
relevant.
in
our
case
here
in
jewel,
it
happens
that
the
same
evidence
which
establishes
that
it's
a
mandatory
bargaining
subject
also
establishes
that
it
is
within
the
labor
exemption
if
you
look
at
this
case
via
the
norris-la
guardia
act
and
clayton
act
exemptions
in
the
sherman
act.
mr.
bernard
dunau
then
on
those
facts
it
would
be
--
he
would
not
be
negotiating
a
matter
with
respect
to
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions.
he
would
be
negotiating
a
provision
designed
to
regulate
trading
hours
as
such
as
to
that
kind
of
a
provision
whether
it's
within
a
--
prohibited
or
not
by
the
sherman
act
seems
to
us
to
be
governed
by
the
rule
of
reason
like
any
other
agreement
between
businessmen
in
the
heart--
in
the
instance
that
your
honor
has
posed,
it
seems
to
us
we
are
concerned
with
whether
this
business
agent
is
in
fact
acting
as
an
entrepreneur.
if
he
is,
then
there
is
no
sherman
--
labor
exemption
at
issue
at
all.
if
he
is
acting
as
an
entrepreneur
or
if
a
union
is
acting
as
an
entrepreneur
in
that
capacity
it
does
not
come
with
any
sherman
act
immunity.
it's
like
any
other
businessman.
it
seems
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
their
agreement
is
about
wages,
let
me
take
the
illustration
they
--
or
about
hours.
they
don't
want
to
work
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
don't
want
to
work
their
men
longer
than
six
hours,
that
is
hours
of
employment.
employers
are
allowed
to
combine
with
respect
to
that
subject.
it
is
not
an
agreement
with
respect,
in
restraint
of
trade.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
difference
between
a
hypothetical
that
your
honor
suggests
and
the
one
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
suggests
is
precisely
the
difference
between
the
subjects
of
the
agreement.
the
subjects
in
your
honors
hypothetical,
as
i
understand
it
pertained
to
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions
and
employers
can
combine
on
those
subjects.
mr.
bernard
dunau
then,
on
those
bare
facts,
you
wouldn't
know
what
they
were
doing.
you
have
to
have
further
facts
in
order
to
understand
whether
you
are
dealing
with
a
wage
hour
and
working
condition
question
or
whether
you
are
dealing
with
a
restraint
of
trade
question.
you
simply
could
not
answer
it
on
those
bare
facts.
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
then
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
then
we
get
into
the
labor
exemption,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
second
way
into
the
case
is
via
the
labor
exemption.
we
can
assume
in
this
case
that
the
market
operating
hours
provision
is
a
restraint
of
trade.
it's
an
undue
restriction
on
commercial
competition.
you
still
cannot
reach
it
if
as
this
finding
shows
it
was
entered
in
by
the
union
in
itself
interest
free
of
abetment
of
a
businessman's
conspiracy.
on
those
facts,
it
would
make
no
difference
whether
you
were
dealing
with
a
restraint
of
trade
or
whether
you're
dealing
with
the
wage
hour
and
working
condition.
and
that
is
why
on
our
view
of
our
case,
we
have
two
strings
to
our
bow;
one,
we
are
dealing
with
wages,
hours,
and
working
conditions
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
therefore
we
are
out
of
the
sherman
act
all
together.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
was
a
great
dispute
in
the
district
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
as
you
read
the
briefs,
your
honor,
but
so
long
as
the
district
court
found
the
facts
as
they
found
them
and
those
findings
were
undisturbed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
jewel
can
argue
all
at
once
that
the
facts
should
be
read
differently.
they
come
here
armored
not
only
by
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
they
come
armored
by
the
two
court
rule.
if
jewel
wants
to
argue
in
this
court
that
the
fact
should
have
been
found
differently
by
the
district
court,
it
is
welcome
to
that
burden.
we
take
the
findings
as
the
district
court
made
them
undisturbed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
i
before
--
i
will
come
to
that
in
just
one
moment
but
this
does
raise
the
third
question
in
this
case.
we
say
it's
wages
hours,
and
working
conditions.
jewel
says
it's
a
restraint
of
trade.
we
think
that
means
that
this
question
should
have
first
been
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
as
the
body
which
the
congress
has
set
off
to
decide
whether
a
subject
is
or
is
not
a
mandatory
bargaining
subject.
we
think,
therefore,
that
this
complaint
had
no
business
in
the
district
court
without
prior
recourse
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
but
now
as
to
the
finding
of
fact,
i
want
to
read
to
the
court
the
ultimate
finding
of
fact
of
the
district
court.
that
this
appears
on
page
672
just
above
the
--
probably
on
number
198.
we
have
in
this
case
two
volumes
of
record
and
we're
talking
about
volume
i
pertaining
to
the
testimony
and
the
exhibits.
the
union's
insistence
on
the
retention
of
the
marketing
hour
restriction
was
based
upon
its
desire
to
protect
its
right
not
to
work
at
night
and
to
protect
its
work
from
being
taken
by
others.
those
facts
and
circumstances
are
inimical
to
plaintiff's
theory
that
the
unions
insisted
on
the
restriction
as
the
tool
of
the
employer
group
and
at
their
behest.
on
the
contrary,
the
evidence
establish
that
the
restriction
was
imposed
after
arms
length
bargaining
including
an
overwhelming
strike
vote
against
night
work,
and
was
fashioned
exclusively
by
the
unions
to
serve
their
own
interests,
how
long
and
what
hours
members
shall
work,
what
work
they
shall
do,
and
what
pay
they
shall
receive.
these
are
not
objects
which
the
antitrust
laws
prescribed.
they
are
conditions
of
employment
and
as
such
are
clearly
within
the
labor
exemption
of
the
sherman
act.
this
is
the
ultimate
finding
effect
in
our
view.
this
finding
having
been
undisturbed
is
dispositive
of
the
claim
that
the
unions
on
any
theory
have
violated
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
what
went
into
this
finding
of
fact?
mr.
bernard
dunau
(voice
overlap)
men.
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
the
finding
and
the
suppositious
case
are
simply
irreconcilable.
when
the
district
court
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
issue
was
hardly
--
hard
--
litigated
hard
in
the
district
court
because
jewel
says
it's
a
fact
that
you
can
operate
a
self
service
meat
department
without
employees
and
we
say
nonsense
you
cannot
operate
a
meat
department
service
or
self
service
without
employees.
and
the
finding
of
the
district
court
on
that
issue
was
in
our
favor.
on
page
672
of
the
record,
talking
about
the
same
page,
talking
about
the
ostensible
possibility
of
operating
a
self
service
meat
department
without
employees.
it
meant
this
proposal
that
their
work
would
be
done
with
others
unskilled
in
the
trade
since
the
evidence
showed
that
in
stores
where
meat
is
sold
at
night,
it
is
impractical
to
operate
without
either
butchers
or
other
employees.
someone
must
arrange,
replenish,
and
clean
the
counters
and
supply
customer
services.
and
then
the
district
court
repeated
that
finding
on
page
675.
even
in
self
service
markets,
meat
--
oh
that
is
--
night
meat
sales
even
in
self
service
markets
require
as
a
matter
of
practical
operation,
the
services
of
either
butchers
or
other
employees.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
and
that
got
back
to
the
fundamental
position
of
the
district
court
and
our
fundamental
position.
our
object
is
twofold.
one,
not
to
work
at
night
and
two,
not
to
have
our
work
be
performed
by
anybody
else,
and
that
the
marketing
hour
restriction
was
necessary
to
be
sure
that
both
were
accomplished.
it
was
no
good
not
to
work
at
night
but
to
find
that
the
retail
clerks
or
the
supervisors
were
doing
our
work.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
is
butcher's
work.
there
is
a
finding
specifically
on
that
subject.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it's
covered
in
terms
by
the
agreement
and
we
covered
it
by
testimony
undisputed.
and
there
is
a
finding
of
facts
specifically
that
cleaning
the
counters,
rearranging
the
stock,
replenishing
the
stock
is
butcher's
work.
so
when
we
are
talking
about
loss
of
work
to
others,
we
are
talking
about
that
work
which
under
the
agreement
is
done
by
the
employees
we
represent.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
they
would
be.
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
we
would
not
have
a
perfectly
good
remedy
against
them
your
honor
because
we
know
that
you
cannot
police
these
things.
we
know
from
the
exception
that
is
contained
to
the
limitation
of
market
operating
hours,
it
pertains
to
fresh
meat.
other
meat
department
products
may
be
sold
after
6
p.m.
and
the
agreement
is
that
these
other
products
will
be
stocked
in
the
cases
before
6
p.m.
and
will
not
be
handled
by
any
employees
after
6
p.m.
we
know
and
the
finding
is
that
in
fact
invariably
after
6
p.m.
that
meat
is
being
restocked
and
those
counters
are
being
cleaned
either
by
the
manager,
the
assistant
manager,
or
the
grocery
clerks.
we
had
an
instance
of
cheating
in
the
very
course
of
trial
which
we
brought,
induce
evidence
on
and
there
are
findings
here
that
the
--
one
of
the
reasons
the
union
fears
self
service
operation
extensively
without
employees
that
in
fact
employers
cheat
on
the
promise
that
they
will
not
have
--
that
no
one
will
do
this
work
but
butchers.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
--
the
evidence
in
indiana
is
the
evidence
of
cheating
we
uncovered
here.
on
either
tuesday
or
wednesday
night,
when
they
were
supposed
to
be
operating
this
meat
department
without
employees,
one
of
our
people
went
into
that
store.
there
were
two
grocery
clerks
in
the
cooling
room
of
the
meat
department.
our
witness
asked
for
a
runt
roast
and
the
grocery
clerks
brought
out
two
to
ask
him
to
make
a
selection.
this
is
cheating.
this
is
what
happens
in
indiana
where
supposedly
you
operate
a
meat
department
at
night
without
employees.
but
furthermore,
taking
indiana
on
jewels'
own
representation,
the
record
shows
as
clearly
as
anything
can
be
shown
that
even
in
little
hammond,
gary
area
in
indiana
which
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
you
always
have
a
meat
cutter
on
duty
at
least
thursday
and
friday.
you
may
have
a
meat
cutter
on
duty
other
nights
of
the
week
depending
on
the
volume
of
business.
and
the
only
time
you
do
not
have
a
meat
cutter
on
duty
is
when
business
is
light.
so
when
business
is
brisk
and
the
only
time
therefore
that
night
operation
makes
any
difference,
you
always
have
a
meat
cutter.
now,
this
is
what
jewel's
chief
negotiator
said
in
his
deposition
which
he
did
not
disclaim
at
the
trial
about
the
so-called
operation
in
indiana.
he
said
in
lake
county,
indiana,
we
are
required
to
have
a
meat
cutter
on
duty
only
on
thursdays
and
fridays.
we
are
usually
open
five
nights
a
week.
we
usually
have
a
meat
cutter
on
duty
mondays
and
tuesdays
in
addition
to
thursdays
and
fridays.
wednesday
is
a
pretty
light
night
and
some
of
our
markets
will
not
have
a
meat
cutter
on
duty
on
those
nights.
this
was
the
information
known
to
jewels'
chief
negotiator.
this
was
obviously
the
information
on
which
he
was
acting
when
he
was
negotiating
with
the
unions.
and
it
is
simply
fictitious
to
assume
that
either
jewel's
negotiators
or
anybody
else
were
negotiating
the
subject
of
market
operating
hours
on
the
artificial
assumption
that
you
could
in
truth
operate
a
self
service
meat
department
without
employees.
in
fact,
that
proposal
and
the
only
proposal
that
was
ever
made
to
that
effect
were
made
by
jewel
in
1961
in
the
last
minute
of
contract
negotiations
when
the
negotiations
were
breaking
up.
a
serious
proposal
is
not
made
in
the
last
moment
when
negotiations
were
breaking
up.
no
other
proposal
of
that
kind
was
made
in
1957,
1959
or
1961.
what
we
have
here,
therefore,
is
a
question
as
to
whether
the
man
must
work
at
night
and
whether
their
work
will
be
taken
over
by
others.
now,
this
goes
back
a
long
time.
this
goes
back
to
november
1919
more
than
45
years
ago.
in
1919,
the
meat
departments
in
chicago
were
operated
81
hours
a
week,
seven
days
a
week.
the
meat
departments
were
operated
from
seven
in
the
morning
to
seven
at
night,
monday
through
friday.
they
were
operated
from
seven
in
the
morning
to
10
at
night
on
saturday
but
they
were
operated
from
seven
in
the
morning
to
one
in
the
afternoon
on
sunday.
in
november
1919,
the
union
called
a
strike
that
was
local
546
which
is
now
the
biggest
local
and
was
then,
i
believe,
the
only
local.
they
called
a
strike
and
the
object
of
the
strike
was
expressed
in
four
words;
more
money,
less
hours.
and
what
they
wanted
on
less
hours
was
one
hour
off
in
the
morning,
one
hour
off
at
night,
and
no
sunday
hours.
that
strike
lasted
for
eight
days.
they
want
it.
at
the
end
of
the
strike,
marketing
and
working
hours
were
in
chicago
placed
at
8
a.m.
to
7
p.m.
monday
through
saturday
--
oh
that
is
8
a.m.
to
7
p.m.
monday
through
friday,
8
a.m.
to
9
p.m.
on
saturday
and
no
sunday
hours.
year
1920
was
the
year
at
least
so
far
as
we
were
able
to
uncover
files.
this
far
back
was
the
first
written
contract
we
could
find.
what
was
written
in
1920
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
pertaining
to
meat
cutters
in
the
chicago
area
remains
the
kind
of
agreement
we
have
now
with
the
only
difference
being
the
hours
which
are
presently
limited.
in
1920,
this
was
the
agreement,
nine
hours
shall
constitute
the
basic
working
day.
hours
shall
be
8
a.m.
to
6
p.m.
except
in
saturdays
and
days
preceding
holidays
beginning
at
8
a.m.
and
quitting
at
9
p.m.
it
is
expressly
understood
that
no
customers
will
be
served
to
come
into
the
market
after
6
p.m.
and
9
p.m.
on
saturdays
and
on
days
preceding
the
holiday.
the
first
written
agreement
combine
marketing
hours
and
working
hours
that
combination
exists
in
every
agreement
in
the
chicago
area
through
the
one
that
exists
today.
in
1937,
the
hours
on
saturday
were
reduced
from
9
p.m.
to
7
p.m.
in
1941,
the
hours
on
saturday
were
reduced
to
6
p.m.
in
1945,
they
were
reduced
on
saturday
to
3
p.m.
in
1946,
to
1
p.m.
in
1947,
the
short
day
on
saturday
was
discontinued.
it
went
back
to
6
o'clock.
it's
been
that
way
ever
since.
the
agreements
are
explicit
marketing
hours
and
working
hours
stops
at
6
o'clock.
and
the
reason
they
stop
at
6
o'clock,
and
the
reason
they
were
regulated
in
1919
as
a
result
of
the
strike
is
because
the
men
do
not
want
to
work
at
night.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
and
this
was
in
the
agreement
in
1920.
in
the
agreement
in
1920,
it
said
this,
overtime
to
be
limited
to
one
hour
everyday
and
shall
be
performed
behind
locked
doors
at
the
rate
of
$1.50
per
hour.
behind
locked
doors,
meaning
the
market
shall
be
closed
was
one
of
the
safeguards
which
was
in
this
agreement
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
we
read
the
findings,
this
is
on
18a
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
19a.
mr.
bernard
dunau
this
19a,
your
honor,
is
the
first
opinion
on
the
interlocutory
appeal
prior
to
the
trial.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
did
say
something
upon
which
the
jewel
relies
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
swept
aside
all
the
findings.
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
this
is
at
page
692
of
the
record,
692
to
693.
that
is
the
--
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
on
page
5a
of
the
petition
for
the
writ.
it
says,
“the
evidence
admitted
by
the
district
court
on
remand
is
in
the
record
now
before
us.
it
sustains
the
material
allegations
of
the
complaint.
there
are
no
factual
disputes
revealed
by
the
evidence,
no
question
as
to
the
credibility
of
any
witness
on
any
issue
which
we
consider
has
been
raised
--
which
we
consider
relevant
has
been
raised.
it's
the
single
line
which
jewel
picks
out
to
show
that
all
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
evidence
have
been
swept
aside.
we
say
that
the
key
to
that
sentence
is
the
word
material
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
disturb
a
single
finding.
it
rendered
them
irrelevant
by
its
view
of
the
law.”
mr.
bernard
dunau
which
part
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
effectuated
on
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
that
goes
to
another
subject,
your
honor.
that
goes
to
a
question
upon
which
the
writ
was
denied.
the
question
which
we
present
on
which
the
writ
was
denied
namely
whether
assuming
these
were
an
agreement
exclusively
between
businessmen,
it
would
be
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
that
does
not
go
to
the
findings
with
which
we
are
concerned.
and
in
our
view,
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
undercut
the
findings
by
its
view
of
the
law
not
to
disturb
what
the
findings
were.
they
did
two
things.
one,
they
said,
it
doesn't
matter
that
you
are
interested
in
not
working
at
night.
the
time
that
a
store
shall
be
opened
is
to
be
determined
by
the
merchant.
you
will
work
those
hours
so
long
as
those
are
the
hours
that
the
merchant
wants
to
keep
the
store
open.
that
was
the
way
it
got
rid
of
all
the
labor
attributes
of
the
limitation.
and
that
got
rid
of
the
finding
that
there
was
no
conspiracy
by
saying
it
doesn't
matter
that
there's
no
conspiracy.
it's
enough
that
there
is
an
agreement
which
was
entered
into
as
a
result
of
joint
negotiations.
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
i
said
yesterday
that
extension
of
market
operating
hours
means
extension
of
working
hours
and
that
when
you
negotiate
the
one,
you
negotiate
the
other
and
i
want
to
continue
and
say
a
few
words
about
that.
except
for
a
single
proposal
at
the
break
up
of
negotiations
in
1961,
every
proposal
that
was
ever
made
for
self-service
operation
was
a
proposal
to
have
men
at
work
at
night.
this
was
explicit
in
the
proposals
made
either
by
jewel
tea
or
by
the
other
employers.
the
negotiations
went
to
trying
to
persuade
the
union
to
have
the
men
work
at
night
and
there
were
two
parts,
two
essential
elements
of
that
negotiation.
one,
a
flexible
workday,
that
meant
if
you
were
going
to
have
men
working
after
6
o'clock,
how
do
you
schedule
them
in
for
work.
do
you
schedule
them
in
at
nine
to
work
through
nine?
do
you
schedule
them
in
at
noon
to
work
through
nine?
do
you
schedule
them
in
at
ten
to
work
through
eight?
the
flexible
workday
was
one
of
the
major
issues
discussed
between
the
parties
and
that
issue
went
to
whether
--
not
to
whether
the
men
worked,
to
when
the
men
would
be
scheduled
into
work
after
6
o'clock.
the
employer's
object
was
to
get
as
they
called
it
a
completely
flexible
workday
so
that
for
the
men
who
would
work
after
6
o'clock,
you
would
schedule
them
in
for
work
at
noon,
they
would
work
there
eight
straight
time
hour
shifts
through
nine
and
you
would
have
no
premium
paid
unless
for
the
work
after
six,
unless
you
negotiate
a
premium
pay
as
such.
and
so
the
second
element
of
the
negotiation
of
the
extension
of
marketing
hours
was
how
much
if
anything
you
would
pay
for
the
work
after
6
o'clock
and
the
proposals
by
the
employers
range
from
straight
time
which
meant
no
premium
for
work
after
six
to
$0.25
an
hour
which
meant
$0.75
premium
for
working
three
hours
after
6
o'clock
to
a
halftime
premium.
these
people
therefore
when
they
were
negotiating
with
each
other,
were
talking
about
men
at
work,
how
much
you
would
pay
for
having
the
men
at
work
and
how
you
would
schedule
them
in
for
work
and
the
district
court's
ultimate
finding
with
respect
to
the
import
of
the
negotiations
was
this,
at
page
672.
“lifting
the
restriction
on
marketing
hours
would
mean
a
return
to
longer
hours
and
night
work.
this
is
evident
from
the
face
of
the
employer
proposals
which
included
the
flexible
day,
night
hours
and
wage
premiums
to
sell
night
work
and
from
the
practices
of
the
trade,
particularly
in
plaintiff
stores
where
night
sales
of
fresh
meat
were
authorized.”
the
district
judge
was
referring
to
the
fact
that
outside
the
chicago
area
with
virtually
no
exceptions
when
a
meat
department
operated
after
6
pm,
men
were
at
work.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
blink
the
fact
that
extension
of
marketing
hours
meant
extension
of
working
hours.
they
met
that
problem
in
this
way.
they
said
the
self-protective
interest
of
the
unions
was
limited
to
the
number
of
hours
a
day
a
man
could
be
required
to
work.
could
you
have
them
work
more
than
eight
hours,
nine
hours,
ten
hours,
but
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
unions
have
no
self-protective
interest
in
what
hours
of
the
day
or
what
days
of
the
week
they
would
work.
you
could
work
them
after
6
o'clock
so
long
as
you
work
them
only
eight
hours.
so
if
you
started
them
at
noon
and
work
through
nine,
that
was
eight
hours,
you
weren't
being
required
to
work
more
than
eight,
that
was
the
end
of
your
interest.
you
could
work
them
on
sundays
because
the
objection
there
would
go
to
what
day
of
the
week
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
the
employer's
business.
in
short,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was,
because
the
hours
of
the
day
and
the
days
of
the
week
that
men
would
work,
also
controlled
the
hours
that
the
business
can
be
open,
what
hours
the
business
shall
be
open,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
is
the
merchant's
exclusive
managerial
prerogative,
he
determines
that
and
when
he
determines
it,
he
also
determines
when
the
men
shall
come
in
to
work.
the
practical
import
is
very
clear.
we
know
what
happens
outside
the
chicago
area
where
there
is
no
limitation
on
market
operating
hours.
jewel
operates
33
stores
outside
the
chicago
area.
in
all
but
one,
the
market
is
open
after
6
pm.
in
two
stores,
the
market
is
open
to
11
o'clock
at
night.
in
eight
stores,
the
market
is
open
six
nights
in
a
week,
including
saturday
night
until
9
o'clock.
in
seven
stores,
the
markets
are
open
on
sunday
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
telling
us
is
that
we
have
no
self-protective
interest
in
bargaining
about
not
working
until
11
o'clock
at
night
and
not
working
on
saturdays
until
9
o'clock
and
not
working
on
sundays.
on
the
fourth
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
believe
there
is
a
premium
paid
for
the
work
after
6
o'clock.
i
don't
recall
now
and
i'm
not
sure
the
record
shows
the
basis
of
it
but
i
believe
there
is
a
premium
paid.
mr.
bernard
dunau
only
if
one
agrees
that
the
men
want
to
work
after
night.
if
the
men
don't
want
to
work
after
night,
there
is
no
benefit
to
working
after
night.
the
choice
that
the
men
have
made
is
whether
they're
going
to
work
after
6
o'clock
and
the
choice
they
have
made
is
that
they
don't
want
to
work
after
6
o'clock.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
i
may,
i
will
come
to
that
in
just
one
moment
because
this
is
jewel's
argument.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
just
want
to
finish
on
this
point
first.
mr.
bernard
dunau
now
i
think
your
honor
will
find
though
when
your
wife
goes
shopping,
she
is
not
just
picking
up
that
meat
at
the
counter.
she
is
ringing
a
little
bell
when
she
doesn't
find
what
she
wants
and
there's
a
butcher
poking
his
head
through
a
little
cubby
hole
saying
what
can
i
do
for
you
ma'am
and
she
says,
i
want
some
kind
of
a
rump
roast
that's
not
here
and
she
gets
it
that
way.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
so-called
self-service
meat
operation
without
employees.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i'll
come
to
that
your
honor.
in
our
view,
the
court
of
appeals
faced
this
squarely
and
said
the
men
had
to
work
at
night
because
the
merchant
wanted
to
stay
open
at
night.
unfortunately
for
that
position,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
unions
have
an
explicit
right
to
bargain
about
hours
of
employment.
their
position
on
hours
of
employment
can
very
well
conflict
with
the
merchant's
position
as
to
when
he
wants
the
store
open.
when
the
merchant's
choice
is
to
when
he
wants
to
stay
open
conflicts
with
the
man's
choice
as
to
whether
you
want
to
work
and
you
settle
it
at
the
bargaining
table
and
if
you
don't
settle
it
there,
to
put
it
bluntly,
you
settle
it
on
the
picket
line
but
you
don't
settle
it
in
a
courtroom
as
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now
it's
quite
clear,
jewel
does
not
want
to
face
to
defend
its
judgment
that
it
got
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
that
the
men
have
to
work
after
6
o'clock
just
because
the
merchant
wants
to
stay
open
after
six
and
so
jewel
says
this.
“we
are
perfectly
willing
to
operate
a
self-service
meat
department
without
anybody
on
duty
after
6
o'clock.
that
satisfies
our
wish
to
be
open
for
business
and
your
wish
not
to
work.”
i
said
yesterday
that
the
big
problem
they
have
with
that
contention
is
that
the
finding
of
fact
is
just
the
other
way
that
you
cannot
operate
a
self-service
meat
department
after
6
pm
without
employees
on
duty.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
does
not.
ultimately
your
honor,
this
certainly
the
record
shows
that
our
position
is
taken
reasonably
and
in
good
faith
and
we
can
bargain
on
the
basis
of
our
view
that
you
cannot
operate
a
self-service
meat
department
after
6
pm,
and
when
we
bargain
in
good
faith
reasonably
on
that
basis,
we
are
not
violating
any
antitrust
laws
just
because
somebody
else
says,
you
can
do
it
differently
than
we
think
it
can
be
said.
so
ultimately,
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference
but
we
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
even
though
they
maybe
right,
but
in
this
case,
we
don't
even
have
that
hurdle
because
based
on
the
findings
in
this
record,
they
are
not
right.
first,
we
have
been
in
this
meat
business
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
the
decision
as
to
whether
the
employer
is
right
or
we
are
right,
is
not
a
decision
which
has
to
be
made
in
a
courtroom
by
a
judge.
that's
a
decision
which
the
laws
have
committed
to
the
merchant
and
the
union
at
a
bargaining
table.
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
we
can
without
violating
the
antitrust
laws,
take
the
position
that
he
is
wrong
and
i
suppose
perhaps,
one
of
the
fundamental
questions
in
this
case
is
when
with
respect
to
a
matter
which
touches
on
working
conditions
depending
on
which
way
the
fact
is,
i
suppose
one
of
the
fundamental
questions
is,
can
you
go
to
a
district
court
to
have
a
district
judge
tell
you
whether
one
or
the
other
side
is
right
or
is
this
question
as
to
whether
a
particular
matter
does
or
does
not
affect
working
conditions,
something
which
is
confined
to
the
bargaining
table
and
left
to
the
autonomy
of
the
party.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
didn't
say
we
could
make
any
old
silly
claim.
i
said
this
record
shows
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
all
the
judge
can
say
is
that
we
are
taking
a
position
that
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
and
when
we
take
a
position
that
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese,
nobody
in
his
right
mind
has
to
say
we
are
talking
about
wages
when
we're
talking
about
price
control.
mr.
bernard
dunau
a
good
faith
claim
that
what
the
union
is
bargaining
for
is
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions,
puts
it
on
the
bargaining
table
and
outside
the
courtroom,
yes
sir.
mr.

dunau
it
does
not
--
court
inquiry.
it
does
not
insulate
it
from
the
inquiry
by
the
labor
board
as
to
whether
in
fact
it
is
a
mandatory
bargaining
subject.
before
the
labor
board,
we
would
have
to
demonstrate
not
simply
our
good
faith,
but
what
in
fact
is
the
effect
of
what
we
claim
on
the
actual
condition
of
work.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
so
far
as
the
antitrust
laws
are
concerned,
if
the
union
is
making
a
good
faith
claim
that
is
the
end
of
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
bernard
dunau
jewel
can
get
us
before
the
labor
board
on
any
contract
negotiation.
we
will
insist
anytime
they
propose
night
operations,
we
will
insist
you
are
not
going
to
get
it
if
it's
a
non-mandatory
bargaining
subject,
they've
got
a
classic
refusal
to
bargain.
mr.
bernard
dunau
market
operating
hours
as
such,
not
that
i
know
of
your
honor,
no
sir.
they
have
of
course
through
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
express
their
opinion
that
it
is
a
mandatory
bargaining
subject,
but
i
don't
believe
they've
had
it
in
their
litigated
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
your
honor
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
whole
business,
i'm
sorry,
by
the
whole
business,
do
you
mean
the
retail,
the
grocery
department?
we
have
no
concern
about
the
grocery
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
that
is
the
reach
of
it.
i
mean
the
reach
of
it
is,
that
if
our
men,
we'll
take
the
absurd
case,
don't
want
to
work
more
than
from
9
o'clock
until
noon,
it's
not
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
it
maybe
the
craziest
thing
under
the
sun
and
i
can't
imagine
it
happening
but
it's
not
remediable
under
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
bernard
dunau
work
schedule
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
work
scheduling
is
an
everyday
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
the
only
thing
unique,
if
it's
unique
in
this
case
is
that
we
call
it
market
operating
hours.
we
shut
the
market
down
because
you
can
--
only
by
shutting
the
market
down,
can
you
be
sure
of
two
things,
one
that
you
will
not
work
after
nine
--
after
six
and
two
that
your
work
will
not
be
done
by
anybody
else.
mr.
bernard
dunau
just
the
meat
department
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
we
have
been
bargaining
over
the
years
with
these
employers.
in
55
or
56,
they
made
a
proposition
and
they
said
look,
you
are
not
allowing
us
to
sell
frozen
fresh
poultry
from
our
self-service
cases
after
6
o'clock.
the
customer
can
get
it
at
papa
and
mama
stores
in
which
you
have
nobody.
they
can
get
it
in
delicate
stores,
what
sense
does
it
make
to
cut
our
throats
by
having
us
lose
this
business
and
the
union
said,
okay,
you've
made
a
good
case
on
it,
we'll
accept
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
sir,
i
cannot
say
that
human
beings
negotiating
with
each
other
are
going
to
have
things
come
out,
controlled
by
a
beautiful
syllogism
and
everything
will
line
up
to
one
perfect
solution.
if
the
objection
to
market
operating
hours
is
that
we
allow
the
sale
of
poultry
after
6
pm,
we
can
remedy
that.
we'll
eliminate
the
sale
of
poultry
after
6
pm,
that's
not
what
these
people
want.
they
want
the
market
open
for
the
sale
of
fresh
meat,
but
if
the
objection
is
the
sale
of
poultry,
we'll
get
rid
of
that.
mr.
bernard
dunau
what
happens
when
you
do
it
on
chickens
your
honor?
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
cheat.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
know.
i
said
it's
not
possible
to
do
it
without
the
employees
and
i
insist
it's
not
possible
to
do
it
without
employees.
they
are
using
grocery
clerks
and
managers
and
assistant
managers
to
do
the
work.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
in
fact,
i
don't
have
to
have
the
record
on
this,
i've
got
findings.
at
page
667,
even
--
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
even
in
self
service
departments
are
extensively
operated
without
employees
on
duty
after
6
pm,
there
was
evidence
that
requisite
customer
services
in
connection
with
meat
sales
were
performed
by
grocery
clerks.
in
the
same
vein,
defendants
had
used
evidence
that
in
the
sale
of
delicate
pleasant
items
which
could
be
made
after
6
pm
from
self-service
cases
under
the
contract,
practically
always
during
the
time
that
the
market
was
open,
the
manager
or
other
employees
would
be
rearranging
and
restocking
the
cases,
that
was
the
evidence
on
what
happens
after
6
pm
supposedly
without
employees
on
duty.
my
time
is
up.
i
want
to
only
point
out
one
additional
thing.
jewel
says
here,
it
can
operate
a
self-service
meat
department
without
6
pm.
this
is
its
policy
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
self-service
meat
departments.
its
policy
is,
i
read
from
page
52
of
our
brief.
it
states
as
a
must
that
there
be
a
man
on
the
counter
at
all
times,
jewel
requires
a
butcher
at
the
counter
to
create
a
friendly
and
courteous
atmosphere
between
the
meat
cutters
and
the
customer,
to
keep
the
counter
straight,
perform
any
services
which
the
customer
might
request
and
fill
special
requests
that
the
customer
might
want
which
you
can't
find
in
the
counter.
lastly,
this
is
what
we
say
since
we
are
biased,
we
have
an
interest,
we
had
two
experts
testify
both
operated
self-service
meat
departments
one
operated
12
meat
departments,
one
operated
11
in
chicago
in
1957,
both
wanted
self-service
meat
operation
after
6
o'clock.
both
testified
you
could
not
satisfactorily
operate
a
meat
department
service
or
self-service
after
6
o'clock
without
employees
on
duty.
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
i
have
a
few
moments
your
honor?
there
was
one
aspect
of
this
case
which
i
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
talk
about
in
my
opening
argument
and
i
think
we
ought
to
put
all
this
out
on
the
table
where
everybody
can
see
it.
on
the
assumption
contrary,
to
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
thank
you
very
much
sir.
on
the
assumption
that
you
can
in
truth
operate
a
self-service
meat
department
after
6
o'clock
without
employees
on
duty,
we
still
have
two
labor
objections
to
doing
it,
one
is
workload.
we
don't
want
that
store
operating
after
6
pm.
even
without
employees
on
duty
for
two
reasons.
we
have
to
increase
our
workload
before
6
pm
in
order
to
have
the
meats
to
sell
and
when
the
shambles
are
through
after
these
three
hours
of
unattended
operations,
we
have
to
clean
up
that
mess
the
next
morning,
that's
workload.
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
we
can
take
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
we
can
take
the
position
too
and
it
is
the
position
we
do
take,
we
can
negotiate
it,
but
there's
a
long
difference
between
having
the
power
to
negotiate
and
succeeding
in
your
negotiation,
we
think
we
might
fail
and
that
what
i'll
wind
up
with
is
an
increase
in
workload
by
the
same
complement
of
people
and
we
do
not
wish
to
risk
that,
that's
one.
two
and
this
is
very
important,
we
talk
as
if
the
only
type
of
market
that
the
union
has
to
be
concerned
with
is
a
self-service
meat
department
operation.
there
are
two
types
of
markets
in
the
chicago
area.
they
are
self-service
markets
and
service
markets
and
everybody
agrees
you
cannot
operate
a
service
market
without
employees.
this
is
not
a
conflict
between
independence
and
chains
because
chains
operate
service
markets
and
independents
operates
self-service
markets.
but
it
puts
us
in
this
hopeless
dilemma,
either
if
you
operate
self-service
markets
after
6
pm,
you
either
also
operate
service
markets
after
6
pm,
which
means
the
men
must
work
or
you
keep
your
service
market
closed
after
6
pm,
which
means
that
the
service
market
loses
trade
to
the
self-service
market
and
with
the
loss
of
trade
comes
the
loss
of
employment
and
work.
we
do
not
think
the
antitrust
laws
impale
us
on
the
horns
of
the
dilemma
that
we
must
either
give
up
our
right
not
to
work
at
night,
or
give
up
all
the
butchers
who
work
in
the
service
departments,
the
work
and
the
jobs
they
get
if
the
market
stays
closed.
this
turns
right
into
mr.
justice
goldberg's
hypothetical.
suppose
we
insisted
because
we
didn't
want
to
work
at
night
that
the
service
market
stayed
closed,
aren't
we
then
confronted
with
the
identical
antitrust
action
but
on
the
other
foot,
now
their
complaint
is
we
are
suppressing
competition
between
service
and
self-service
markets
by
not
providing
the
men
to
work
after
6
pm.
so
whichever
way
we
turn
on
this
hypothesis,
we
are
in
trouble.
mr.
bernard
dunau
there's
nothing
inconsistent
between
the
two
frames
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
horns
of
the
dilemma
are
this,
in
terms
of
a
practical
bargaining
situation
on
what
you
do
at
the
bargaining
table,
you
are
faced
with
two
alternatives.
if
you
say
you
can
operate
your
self-service
departments
without
employees,
the
service
departments
then
say,
“how
do
we
operate
after
6
pm?”
you
say,
“well
you
can
operate.”
that's
one
solution.
if
you
operate,
the
men
work
at
night
and
that's
the
end
of
the
labor
objective
of
no
night
work
or,
you
can
say,
“sorry,
you
can't
operate
without
butchers.
so
you
stay
closed.”
that
means
we
lose
work
of
service
butchers
whose
work
and
jobs
to
the
self-service
markets.
those
are
the
horns
of
the
dilemma
that
we
do
not
think
where
the
antitrust
laws
require
us
to
be
impaled
on.
lastly,
what
this
is
all
about,
i
think
can
be
summarized
in
one
sentence
out
of
the
minutes
of
the
contract
negotiating
meeting
in
1961.
these
minutes
are
in
the
record
as
an
offer
of
proof.
we
offer
them
in
the
record
as
one
part
of
our
showing
that
all
we
have
here
is
conventional
trade
activity.
it
was
excluded
from
the
record
as
a
self-serving
statement,
but
there
is
no
question
as
to
authenticity.
jewel
wanted
us
to
put
to
the
men
the
proposition
of
working
self-service
meat
departments
without
any
employees
on
duty.
we
put
it
to
the
men,
but
with
a
recommendation
that
they
turn
it
down
and
this
is
what
the
union's
chief
negotiator
told
the
men
before
the
vote.
secretary
kelly
explained
to
the
membership
that
in
jewel
number
one
proposal,
they
would
add
to
your
workload,
it
would
permit
a
seven-day
operation
around
the
clock,
you
would
have
to
work
ahead
to
stock
the
cases
so
you
could
sell
out
--
so
they
could
sell
their
products
after
6
pm.
you
would
receive
no
extra
pay
of
any
kind
for
the
extra
work
you
have
done
and
it
would
result
in
clerks
doing
your
work.
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
