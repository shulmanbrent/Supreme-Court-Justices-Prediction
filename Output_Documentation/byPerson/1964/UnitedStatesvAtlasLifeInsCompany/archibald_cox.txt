mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
tax
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit
which
has
very
great,
indeed
enormous
financial
implications
for
both
the
government
and
the
life
insurance
industry.
now,
the
potential
claims
for
refund
according
to
our
estimates
run
to
$400,000,000
and
the
annual
revenue
that
they
have
to
pay
and
we
would
receive
we
estimate
as
about
$77,000,000.
one
can
get
at
the
issues
in
the
case
best
i
think
by
beginning
a
little
way
of
talk.
under
state
law,
life
insurance
companies
are
required
to
maintain
a
reserve
for
policyholders.
the
amount
of
the
reserve
is
required
to
be
that
sum
which
with
annual
additions
at
an
assumed
rate
of
interest,
the
same
rate
used
in
calculating
premiums
plus
future
accruing
premiums
will
be
sufficient
to
pay
the
policyholders'
claims
as
they
mature
according
to
actuarial
competitions.
this
means
that
in
each
year,
the
company
must
add
to
its
reserve
an
addition
a
sum
made
up
by
applying
the
accrued
--
the
assumed
rate
of
interest
to
its
--
to
the
reserve.
we've
shown
this
in
an
example
that
i
shall
refer
to
very
frequently
on
a
chart
in
the
very
back
of
our
brief.
you
will
note
there
that
we
have
assumed
a
company
with
a
total
investment
yield
of
a
million
dollars
and
it
is
required
to
set
aside
out
of
that
million
dollars
a
total
of
$800,000
as
the
annual
addition
to
the
policyholders'
reserve.
that
is
--
no,
the
first
element
of
this
problem
is
that
congress
has
since
1921
taken
the
view
that
the
addition
to
the
policyholders
reserve
should
be
allowed
as
a
deduction
in
computing
a
company's
net
income
tax.
and
that's
the
first
element
in
the
problem,
the
annual
addition
to
the
policyholders'
reserve.
the
second
element
in
the
problem
is
the
interest
received
by
a
life
insurance
company
from
state,
county
or
municipal
bonds,
i
shall
call
them
all-state
bonds
for
convenience.
in
our
example,
we
assume
that
the
10%
of
the
total
investment
yield
or
$100,000
which
is
shown
on
the
left
of
our
chart
as
the
cross
attached
area.
i
--
as
a
matter
of
legislative
policy
backed
perhaps
by
constitutional
necessity,
congress
does
not
tax
the
income
from
state
bonds.
now
the
problem
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
very
back
of
our
brief.
it's
a
(inaudilbe).
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
the
very
back.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
shall
refer
to
it
to
take
simplified
figures
quite
frequently.
now
the
problem
revolves
around
at
least
two
factors.
the
annual
addition
of
the
policyholders'
reserve
and
the
income
from
state
bonds
and
what
it
is,
is
simply
this.
in
computing
a
net
income
tax,
what
relationship
--
what
should
be
the
proper
relationship
between
the
dollars
that
the
company
receives
in
state
bond
interest,
$100,000
in
our
example
and
the
dollars
that
flow
into
the
annual
addition
for
the
policyholders'
reserve,
the
gray
area
or
$800,000
in
our
example,
should
it
be
assumed
that
all
the
state
bond
interest,
the
whole
$100,000
went
to
make
up
part
of
the
annual
addition
to
the
policyholders'
reserve?
should
it
be
assumed
that
none
of
the
state
bond
interest
went
to
make
up
the
annual
addition
to
the
policyholders'
reserve,
or
should
the
answer
be
in
between
that
part
of
the
tax-exempt
dollars
went
to
make
up
to
the
policyholders'
reserve
and
part
of
the
tax-exempt
dollars
were
left
to
the
company
or
to
the
shareholders
as
their
profit.
in
the
revenue
act
of
1921,
congress
took
what
was
in
effect
the
first
view.
it
allowed
a
deduction
for
the
addition
to
the
policyholders'
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
would
have
to
--
surely
you
have
to
do
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
and
that
could
not
be
taxed.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
would
be
no
tax
at
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
$4
from
the
general
motors'
interest
and
$4
from
the
municipal
bond
reduction.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
the
tax
would
be
on
$1
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
because
the
company
has
$1
that's
left.
now,
you'll
note
that
i
may
say
that
in
your
example,
mr.
darrell's
position
would
be
that
there's
no
tax
at
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
our
position
would
be
that
the
way
you
stated
it
first
where
the
statute
requires
all
the
bond
interest
to
be
used
up
first
for
the
policyholders'
reserve
as
in
the
1921
act.
but
we
agree
that
that
is
a
tax
on
straight
bond
interest
under
the
national
life
inc.
but
we
say
in
effect,
to
come
back
if
i
may
to
my
example,
because
it's
--
it
will
never
happen
i
think
that
the
municipal
bond
interest
is
greater
than
the
amount
left
with
the
company.
you
will
all
--
nearly
always
have
although
it
isn't
necessarily
so,
a
smaller
percentage
of
your
assets
in
municipal
bond.
but
then
you
are
required
to
set
aside
for
the
partial
interest.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
in
our
example,
it
comes
to
the
same
thing.
the
1921
statute
said
that
the
company
--
that
the
companies
could
deduct
the
$800,000
or
$8
for
the
annual
addition
to
the
policyholders'
reserve
but
only
less
the
full
amount
of
the
state
bond
interest.
and
that
meant
that
no
matter
how
much
money
you
put
in
the
municipal
bond,
how
much
of
your
income
you
derive
from
it,
you
still
got
only
the
same
deductions
that
was
allowed
to
a
company
which
had
no
money
in
municipal
bond
and
that's
what
the
national
life
case
was.
now,
then
in
1942,
the
congress
took
what
we
regard
as
the
proper
method
of
allocation.
instead
of
saying
that
all
the
money,
all
the
addition
to
the
reserve
must
be
treated
as
coming
from
taxable
income
or
instead
of
saying
that
all
of
this
must
be
treated
as
coming
from
state
bond
interest
to
the
full
amount
of
the
state
bond
interest,
in
1942,
congress
said
we
will
assume
that
the
dollars
flow
ratably.
that
to
use
my
example,
80%
of
the
state
bond
interest
flowed
into
the
reserve
--
the
annual
addition
to
the
policyholders'
reserve
and
that
80%
of
the
taxable
income
flowed
into
the
policyholders'
reserve.
it
did
this
not
on
a
company
by
company
basis
but
on
an
industry
wide
basis
but
it
nevertheless
followed
that
intermediate
or
third
method.
then
in
1959,
congress
revised
the
act
--
taxing
life
insurance
companies
so
as
again
to
follow
the
intermediate
method
making
a
ratable
apportionment
but
doing
it
this
time
on
a
company
by
company
basis.
that
was
done
with
the
support
of
70%
of
the
life
insurance
companies
measured
by
the
value
of
their
assets
and
they
agreed
that
that
did
not
impose
a
tax
on
state
bond
interest.
now,
let
me
if
i
may
turn
to
the
actual
provisions
of
the
statute
and
show
how
this
works
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
--
for
all
purposes,
they
are
the
same
in
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
when
i
said
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
right,
right.
i
just
meant
it
was
available
as
a
crème
at
the
top,
that
was
--
that's
all.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
well,
it's
left
to
the
company.
i
should
have
avoided
the
expression.
it
doesn't
affect
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
statute
is
set
forth
beginning
at
page
87
of
our
brief.
you'll
note
that
section
802
over
on
page
88
imposes
a
tax
on
the
life
insurance
company
taxable
income.
and
then
802
(b)
defines
life
insurance
company
taxable
income
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
major
components
taxable
investment
income
or
gain
from
operations.
gain
from
operations
is
always
a
component
of
life
insurance
company
taxable
income.
in
some
cases,
taxable
investment
income
is
and
in
other
cases,
it
isn't.
now,
the
same
problem
here
essentially
arises
both
in
the
case
of
gain
from
operations
and
the
computation
of
taxable
investment
income.
and
in
order
to
simplify
the
explanation,
i'm
going
to
confine
myself
to
gain
from
operations.
section
809
on
page
93
deals
with
the
subject
of
gain
from
operations,
it
provides
that
the
share
of
each
and
every
item
of
investment
yield
including
the
tax-exempt
interest,
which
is
set
aside
for
policyholders,
shall
not
be
included
in
the
gain
from
operations.
and
you'll
note
that
in
the
second
sentence,
it
provides
a
formula
stating
how
the
share
for
policyholders
shall
be
computed.
and
what
it
is
in
effect
is
a
declaration
that
it
will
be
the
same
percentage
as
the
required
annual
addition
to
the
policyholders'
reserve,
$800,000
in
our
example,
bears
to
the
total
investment
yield,
a
million
in
our
example
or
80%,
so
the
policyholders'
share
is
80%
of
every
item
and
the
company
share
is
80%
of
every
item.
then,
in
defining
gain
or
loss
from
operations,
the
statute
provides
that
it
shall
consist
of
the
company's
share
of
every
item,
the
shares
added
together
plus
various
items
which
are
chiefly
the
underwriting
income
that
we're
not
concerned
with,
less
the
deductions
allowed
in
subdivision
(d)
over
on
page
94.
the
sub
--
the
deductions
allowed
under
subdivision
(d)
on
page
94
include
the
company's
share
of
any
tax-exempt
income,
specifically
state
bond
interest
and
the
intracorporate
dividends
to
a
percentage
and
so
forth.
so
that
in
effect
what
happens
is
that
the
20%
of
the
state
bond
interest
shown
in
the
upper
right
hand
corner
of
my
chart,
it
is
set
aside
as
the
company's
share
and
is
on
any
ratable
allocation
of
the
company's
share
is
excluded
from
gain
from
operations
so
that
it
isn't
taxed
and
the
rest
of
it
of
course
isn't
taxed
because
it
is
treated
as
set
off
to
the
policyholders
and
that
it
--
full
deduction
is
allowed
for
that
amount.
now,
there's
one
further
point
that
i
should
emphasize.
when
the
formula
that
i
have
just
tried
to
describe
and
another
formula
that
was
the
mathematical
and
legal
equivalent
were
before
the
congress,
it
was
argued
that
the
formulas
imposed
a
tax
on
state
bond
interest.
but
that
was
disputed
by
the
treasury.
it
was
disputed
by
both
congressional
committees
and
by
most
of
the
proponents
of
this
bill
but
there
was
an
argument
on
the
point.
the
--
there
was
also
an
argument
on
the
second
point
which
was
what
the
treasury
was
--
which
was
whether
the
treasury
was
really
trying
not
to
say
that
this
wasn't
a
tax
on
state
bond
interest
but
to
overturn
the
whole
doctrine
that
state
bond
interest
is
immune
from
tax
as
some
of
the
earlier
decisions
on
intergovernmental
immunities
had
been
overturned
in
the
1930s
by
this
court.
the
proponents
of
the
bill
agreed
that
it
would
be
undesirable
to
overturn
the
basic
doctrine
apparently.
they
denied
that
this
was
in
a
violation
of
the
basic
doctrine
which
the
critics
asserted
the
opposite.
but
the
upshot
was
that
there
was
written
in
to
the
statute
an
exception
clause
which
appears
on
page
94
of
our
gain
from
operations
is
a
concern,
which
provides
in
substance
that
if
it
is
established,
it's
conditional.
if
it
is
established
that
in
any
case
the
formula
that
i
explained
results
in
a
tax,
the
imposition
of
a
tax
on
the
state
bond
interest,
then
an
adjustment
shall
be
made.
now
the
--
if
it
isn't
satisfied,
then
of
course
the
clause
doesn't
operate.
now,
in
the
present
case,
the
respondent
originally
computed
its
tax
according
to
the
formula
i've
described
and
the
parallel
formula
applicable
to
taxable
investment
income
that
has
a
similar
exception
clause
paid
the
tax.
and
then
it
sued
for
a
refund
claiming
that
the
application
of
the
statutory
formula
resulted
in
a
tax
on
its
state
bond
interest
equivalent
to
the
$100,000
state
bond
interest
in
the
example
that
i've
been
referring
to.
now,
the
district
court
rejected
that
contention
and
dismissed
the
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
with
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
in
its
view
since
respondent
would
not
have
paid
as
high
a
tax
but
for
the
inclusion
of
the
sate
bond
interest
in
the
computation.
the
incidence
of
the
tax
was
on
the
state
bond
interest
bringing
the
case
within
the
exception
clause
and
requiring
an
adjustment,
and
we
then
brought
the
case
here.
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
before
i
turn
to
the
exact
legal
issue
to
emphasize
the
practical
difference
in
the
results
of
the
opposing
computations.
in
our
view,
a
life
insurance
company's
taxable
income
after
deduction
for
the
addition
to
the
reserve
is
reduced
proportionally
as
it
shifts
its
investments
from
taxable
interest
--
to
take
--
yes,
taxable
interest
to
tax-exempt
interest.
for
example,
in
the
exe
--
in
the
illustration
in
the
back
of
the
book,
if
the
total
investment
yield
were
a
million
dollars
entirely
in
taxable
securities,
the
company
would
be
taxed
on
$200,000.
if
it
shifted
10%
of
its
income
into
tax-free
interest
or
if
--
it
should
--
let
me
the
first
5%
of
its
income
into
tax-free
interest,
then
the
income
taxed
would
be
$190,000
or
5%
less.
if
it
put
10%
in
the
tax-exempt
interest,
then
as
the
example
shows,
the
taxed
income
will
be
reduced
10%.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
no!
i
put
--
talking
--
talking
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
about
putting
total.
mr.
archibald
cox
total,
excuse
me.
i
was
talking
about
the
consequence
on
what
was
taxed
after
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
deduction.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
talking
about
total
just
as
shown
--
as
we
show
the
10%
here
by
the
cross
(inaudilbe).
and
my
point
is
that
as
each
fraction
but
--
of
its
income
is
drawn
from
tax-exempt
instead
of
tax
--
mr.
archibald
cox
taxable,
it's
--
the
tax
base
is
reduced
proportionately.
and
we
say
--
and
that
continues,
mr.
justice
stewart,
no
matter
how
much
has
shifted.
if
you
work
it
out,
the
tax
base
will
never
exceed.
in
fact,
it
will
never
equal
the
amount
of
income
drawn
from
taxable
sources.
that
will
always
be
true
and
we
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that
shows
there
is
no
tax
imposed
on
the
tax-free
interest
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
this
is
very
similar
to
the
analysis
of
mr.
justice
stone
in
gehner.
mr.
archibald
cox
which
didn't
prevail,
but
that
was
not
a
case
dealing
with
net
--
a
net
income
tax.
that
was
a
case
dealing
with
a
property
tax.
and
it
was
a
case
of
course
which
proceeded,
as
i
would
explain
a
little
later
the
decision
in
denman
and
slayton
and
the
decision
in
helvering
against
independent
life
insurance
so
that
we
think
gehner
is
distinguishable
on
its
fact
and
in
the
light
of
the
later
authority
certainly
doesn't
control
this
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
there'd
be
no
problem.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
there's
be
no
--
there'd
be
no
problem.
indeed,
turning
now
from
our
view
to
the
respondent's
view
and
concentrating
on
gain
from
operations,
the
respondent
says
there
should
be
no
tax
if
20%
of
the
income
came
from
tax-free
sources
because
it
would
then
say
that
not
$100,000
of
the
$200,000
white
area
had
to
be
subtracted
but
of
course,
it
would
be
twice
as
much
because
it
would
be
20%
rather
than
10%,
they
would
subtract
$200,000
and
they
would
say
that
that
is
true
so
far
as
gains
from
operations
is
concerned.
even
though
in
fact
80%
of
what
was
left
originated
from
taxable
sources.
that
is
the
practical
difference
between
the
two
potentials.
now,
the
legal
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
tax
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
in
the
first
place,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
that
happens
and
it
does
not
violate
the
immunity
or
the
national
life
case
your
honor
wishes
may
discuss
it
now,
seems
to
me
to
be
a
quite
different
problem
in
this
respect.
there,
as
i
explained
a
little
earlier,
the
deduction
which
was
taken
against
taxable
income
was
limited
to
the
actual
cost
to
the
addition
of
the
policyholders'
reserve
less
the
full
amount
of
the
state
bond
interest.
that
--
to
their
--
and
where
is
that
is
not
the
case
here.
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
stewart
here,
every
time
you
shift
money
into
taxable
--
into
non-taxable
income,
you
have
a
somewhat
lower
tax
base
and
a
somewhat
lower
tax.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
i
would
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
let
me
point
out
that
the
--
two
differences.
one
is
there's
a
complete
difference
in
taxable
--
in
practical
result.
the
other
is
i
think
there's
an
entire
difference
in
theory
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
a
net
income
tax,
as
i'll
explain
after
(inaudilbe).
i
--
in
the
national
life
case,
what
happened
was
that
the
man
who
had
income
from
state
bonds
was
denied
the
right
to
deduct
from
his
taxable
income
the
full
cost
of
earning
that
income.
under
this
statute,
a
man
is
allowed
to
deduct
from
his
taxable
income
the
full
cost
of
earning
that
income.
and
i
think
this
is
very
clearly
a
difference
in
theory.
now,
the
language
that
he's
quoted
from
the
national
life
case
in
the
briefs
against
us
speaks
about
a
man
being
denied
a
deduction
allowed
others
because
of
his
holding
state
bonds.
the
court,
just
before
using
that
language,
emphasized
that
this
statute
disallowed
the
normal
deduction
for
the
addition
to
the
policyholders'
reserve
in
the
full
amount,
to
the
full
extent
of
the
state
bond
interest.
and
i
think
what
it
was
saying
was
that
one
who
doesn't
have
municipal
bonds
is
allowed
to
deduct
from
his
taxable
income
the
cost
of
earning
the
taxable
income.
one
who
does
have
municipal
bond
isn't
allowed
to
make
that
deduction
of
the
cost
of
earning
the
taxable
income.
under
this
statute,
he
is
allowed
to
deduct
the
full
cost
of
earning
the
taxable
income
and
we
think
that
is
a
difference
not
only
in
practice,
on
practical
result,
but
also
a
most
material
difference
in
principles
for
reasons
i'll
try
to
state
after
the
recess.
mr.
archibald
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
the
precise
legal
issue
here
is
whether
the
formula
that
i
spelled
out
before
the
recess
as
applied
to
the
computation
of
gain
from
operations
and
the
parallel
formula
used
in
computing
taxable
investment
income
result
in
the
imposition
of
a
tax
on
the
state
bond
interest
or
tax-exempt
income.
we
submit
that
from
whatever
angle
one
approaches
the
case
the
formula
imposes
no
tax
on
the
tax-exempt
income.
there
are
in
fact
two
quite
different
ways
of
looking
at
this
situation.
one
way
of
doing
the
case
is
to
look
upon
the
policyholders'
reserve
and
the
annual
additions
as
if
this
were
a
trust
fund
set
aside
and
this
was
the
annual
payment
of
the
beneficiary's
share
treating
the
policyholders
as
beneficiary.
that's
the
way
the
senate
finance
committee
looked
at
the
situation
is
the
way
that
the
formula
and
the
bill
looks
at
the
situation
and
talks
about
the
share
of
each
and
attributes
to
each
its
ratable
share
of
the
different
kinds
of
income.
now,
if
as
we
believe
and
if
as
we
argue
in
our
brief,
that
is
a
proper
way
of
analyzing
the
situation.
but
then
it
plainly
follows
that
the
formula
imposes
no
tax
on
tax-exempt
interest
for
the
rule
set
forth
in
section
652
(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
followed
uniformly
and
for
a
long
time
is
that
where
a
trust
has
income
from
various
sources,
including
tax-exempt
sources,
then
each
beneficiary
is
supposed
to
get
his
ratable
share
of
the
income
from
each
of
the
sources.
and
in
computing
his
tax,
you
simply
deduct
his
share
of
the
tax-exempt
income
of
the
trust,
and
the
same
thing
is
what
is
done
here.
so
i
say
if
this
is
a
proper
way
of
looking
at
it
as
the
senate
committee
looked
at
it
and
as
we
argue
that
it
is
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
now,
the
other
way
to
look
at
the
problem
is
to
view
the
annual
addition
to
the
reserve
as
a
cost
of
doing
business.
more
specifically,
as
i
shall
show
a
little
later,
as
a
cost
of
producing
the
investment
income
or
the
million
dollars
in
our
example
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
we
argue
that
view
in
this
light
by
any
conventional
tax
principle
or
any
accounting
rule
or
indeed
by
common
sense
there
is
no
imposition
of
the
tax
on
the
state
bond
interest.
the
principles
that
govern
this
are
very
simple
and
very
familiar.
first,
we're
dealing
with
a
tax
on
net
income.
this
is
not
a
gross
receipt
of
property
tax.
second,
the
deductible
costs
that
are
allowed
by
the
government
in
computing
a
net
income
tax
may
be
and
usually
are
limited
to
those
incurred
in
producing
the
taxable
income.
but
personal
expenses
for
example
are
normally
not
deductible
although
to
some
exceptions.
third,
this
rule
in
general
is
plainly
applicable
to
the
cost
of
obtaining
tax-exempt
income
including
interest
from
state
bonds.
that
rule
is
set
forth
in
section
265
(1)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
i
can
illustrate
it
very
simply
by
a
case
that's
covered
by
a
court
of
--
by
tax
court
opinion
and
the
rulings
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
suppose
that
i
had
an
office
in
which
i
manage
and
had
a
clerical
staff
to
manage,
my
investment
securities
from
which
i
receive,
let's
assume,
$10,000
income
a
year,
half
from
state
bond
interest
and
half
from
other
taxable
securities.
and
assume
that
my
--
the
cost
of
my
office,
the
cost
of
the
advice
of
investment
advisers,
the
cost
of
safe
deposit
boxes
and
so
forth
ran
to
$4000.
quite
plainly
under
accepted
decisions,
i
could
subtract
having
half
of
my
income
from
taxable
securities
only
half
my
cost
because
the
other
half
would
be
eligible
to
the
tax-free
income
and
the
congress
would
be
under
no
obligation
to
allow
that
deduction.
now,
that
part
was
squarely
decided
by
the
case
of
denman
against
slayton,
a
decision
rendered
after
missouri
against
gehner,
a
fortiori
after
national
life
case.
there,
the
taxpayer
borrowed
money
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
state
bonds
and
he
sought
to
deduct
the
interest
paid
from
his
taxable
income.
the
commissioner
disallowed
the
deduction
and
this
court
unanimously
held
that
the
denial
was
correct
because
it
does
not
impose
a
tax
on
state
bond
interest
to
limit
the
deductions
from
taxable
income
to
the
cost
of
producing
the
taxable
income.
we
say
that
the
statutory
formula
now
before
the
court
does
no
more
than
limit
a
life
insurance
company's
deductions
from
the
taxable
income
to
the
cost
of
producing
it,
and
that
what
it
does
is
to
deny
a
deduction
for
the
cost
of
producing
the
tax-exempt
income.
now,
the
statutory
formula
is
the
legal
and
mathematical
equivalent
as
i
think
everyone
agrees,
of
doing
this
and
i
refer
again
to
my
example
in
the
very
back
of
the
brief
on
the
foldout
chart.
you
start
with
the
million
dollars
of
total
investment
yield.
then
exclude
all
the
state
bond
interest.
that's
$100,000
leaving
$900,000.
the
annual
addition
to
the
policyholders'
reserve,
$800,000
is
a
cost
of
producing
both
the
taxable
and
the
tax-exempt
income.
the
reserve
is
in
effect
money
which
the
insurance
company
has
collected
from
the
policyholders.
it
borrowed
it
from
them.
and
the
annual
addition
to
the
reserve
at
the
assumed
rate
of
interest
is
what
it
pays
them
for
the
use
of
their
money.
since
the
money
was
invested
in
both
taxable
and
tax-exempt
securities
to
produce
both
taxable
and
tax-exempt
income,
the
interest
paid
the
policyholders
in
effect
for
a
loan
that
the
interest
--
a
portion
of
the
loan
put
into
the
tax-exempt
securities
for
the
cost
of
producing
the
tax-exempt
income
is
under
denman
and
slayton,
something
that
the
government
need
not
allow
in
allowing
the
deduction
from
the
cost
of
producing
taxable
income.
so
to
go
back
to
the
chart,
it
needn't
allow
$80,000
of
the
total
cost
of
producing
both
kinds
of
income
and
may
limit
the
deduction
to
$720,000
which
comes
out
the
arithmetic
of
it
in
every
case
exactly
the
way
the
formula
in
the
senate
bill.
indeed,
this
was
the
formula
in
the
house
bill
but
the
senate
thought
the
other
way.
the
first
way
i
described
of
looking
at
it
was
clearer.
now,
i
can
see
only
two
conceivable
distinctions
between
denman
and
slayton
and
the
present
case.
one
is
that
in
denman
and
slayton,
it
was
possible
to
trace
the
proceeds
of
the
loan
into
the
municipal
bonds
and
to
make
the
allocation
via
system
of
tracing.
but
we're
thoroughly
familiar
with
other
ways
of
making
allocations
in
accounting
and
i
take
that
it's
not
even
the
respondent
would
care
to
stand
on
that
difference.
the
difference
urged
by
the
respondent
is
that
the
interest
paid
in
denman
and
slayton
was
a
direct
cost
of
producing
the
taxable
income,
whereas
here
he
says
it's
not.
he
argues
that
the
taxpayer
in
denman
and
slayton
would
not
have
incurred
the
cost
of
the
interest
charges
without
receiving
the
tax-exempt
income.
whereas
he
says
that
if
the
insurance
company
would
have
been
obliged
to
make
this
addition
to
the
policyholders'
reserve
even
though
it
didn't
receive
any
income,
any
of
the
$100,000
from
the
money
invested
in
the
state
bonds.
we
deny
both
the
fact
of
the
difference
and
that
the
difference
has
any
legal
significance
even
if
it
exists.
slayton
would
have
had
to
pay
the
interest
on
the
money
that
he
borrowed
it,
if
he'd
borrowed
it
and
say
the
municipality
had
defaulted
on
the
payment
of
interest,
or
if
he
borrowed
it
and
had
let
the
money
stand
as
idle
cash.
equally,
the
respondent,
the
only
way
it
could
have
this
much
borrowed
from
the
policyholders
if
he
did
borrow
it
is
either
by
having
the
municipalities
default
or
by
letting
the
money
stand
as
idle
cash
as
a
practical
matter
for
both
of
them.
slayton
when
he
obtained
the
loan
and
the
insurance
company
when
it's
obtaining
money
on
this
scale
from
its
policyholder
has
only
one
choice.
it
must
either
invest
this
in
taxable
or
tax-exempt
securities.
it
couldn't
survive
and
let
it
stay
idle
and
it's
quite
absurd
we
think
to
talk
about
this
case
as
if
an
insurance
company
went
out
and
obtained
this
money
for
policyholders
and
then
just
held
it
in
idle
cash
and
to
make
a
comparison
to
that
fantastic
supposition,
congress
certainly
wasn't
required
to
do
that.
second,
we
say
that
even
if
this
is
a
factual
difference,
it's
not
of
any
legal
significance
because
this
is
a
properly
allocable
cost
even
if
you
say
it
isn't
as
direct
a
cost
as
i
argue
it
is.
and
that
we
think
was
plainly
decided
in
helvering
against
independent
life
insurance
company,
which
followed
denman
and
slayton
and
was
decided
on
the
authority
of
denman
and
slayton.
there
the
statute,
a
tax
in
the
insurance
company
not
only
on
its
investment
income
generally
speaking
but
also
on
its
income
from
rent,
the
particular
company
owned
a
building
part
of
which
it
rented,
part
of
which
it
occupied.
the
statue
provided
in
effect
--
it
was
more
complicated
but
in
effect
as
the
court
saw
it,
the
statute
provided
that
the
deduction
they've
got
for
the
cost
of
the
building
should
be
allocated
partly
to
its
own
occupancy
and
partly
to
the
portion
that
was
rented
and
would
yield
a
taxable
income.
and
that
the
only
deduction
that
was
allowed
was
the
allocable
part
--
there
was
the
part
of
those
costs
allocable
to
the
rent
and
none
was
allowed
for
its
own
--
the
party
occupied
itself.
it
argued
that
this
was
a
direct
tax
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
the
court
said
no
under
denman
and
slayton.
it's
constitutional
to
limit
a
deduction
to
the
fairly
--
to
the
part
of
the
cost
fairly
allocable
to
the
income
taxed.
now,
the
cost
there
certainly
would
have
been
incurred,
many
of
them,
the
taxes
and
the
depreciation
of
whether
the
company
was
in
the
building
or
not.
and
i
might
say
also,
i
don't
want
to
pause
to
develop
it
at
any
length,
that
this
same
principle
of
allocation
is
followed
over
and
over
again
in
another
parallel
problem.
a
state
may
not
tax
--
state
a
may
not
tax
the
income
of
a
company
received
from
out
of
state
sales.
well,
that's
constitutionally
immune
from
tax.
but
clearly
in
determining
what
is
the
income
from
in
state
sales,
you
may
force
it
to
allocate
part
of
its
expenses
of
its
home
office
incurred
within
the
state
to
the
out
of
state
sales
and
limit
the
deduction
to
the
fairly
allocable
part
of
the
cost.
that
is
all
we
think
that
has
been
done
here
that
it's
in
accordance
with
familiar
accounting
and
taxation
principles.
now
you
may
say
at
this
stage
well
the
--
that's
all
very
well
but
if
that
is
right,
what
did
congress
put
the
exception
clause
in
the
statute
for?
you've
got
to
give
some
meaning
to
this
clause
that
if
the
computation
results
and
attack
the
imposition
of
tax
on
state
bond
interest
then
there
shall
be
an
adjustment.
our
answer
to
that
is
simply
this,
that
there
was
the
argument
i
referred
to
in
congress
over
whether
this
did
result
in
the
imposition
of
a
tax.
there
was
also
--
there
were
also
arguments
that
the
treasury
was
seeking
to
attack
the
whole
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
immunities
as
applied
to
income
from
state
bonds.
we
think
that
the
exemption
clause
had
the
affect
of
doing
two
things.
first,
it
made
it
plain
at
the
treasury
if
it
had
this
purpose
could
not
attack
the
general
doctrine
that
you
may
not
impose
a
tax
on
the
income
from
state
bonds.
and
second,
that
it
re
--
but
remitted
to
the
courts
the
other
argument
as
to
whether
this
formula
did
impose
a
tax
and
i
have
shown
i
think
affirmatively
that
under
familiar
principles,
it
does
not.
now
let
me
turn
if
i
may
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
--
i
think
that's
the
cost
--
that's
the
question
whether
this
(inaudible)
--
violates
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
question
i've
been
attempting
to
direct
myself
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
think
there
were
two
--
i
think
there
were
two
questions
in
all
fairness.
one
was
what
i
called
the
question
of
the
basic
constitutional
doctrine
that
the
federal
government
has
no
power
to
tax
income
from
state
bond.
i
think
the
congress
did
not
want
that
question
relitigated.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
they
accepted
the
basic
doctrine
that
you
may
not
impose.
i
think
they
accepted
the
whole
body
of
law
that
there
was
no
i
think
national
life
and
gehner
as
i
try
to
explain
to
your
honor
before
lunch,
was
not
inconsistent
with
what
they've
done
and
that
they
might
for
the
purposes
of
this
statute
have
accepted
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
first
they
don't.i
think
second
that
the
congress
intended
the
court
to
appraise
national
life
and
gehner
as
part
of
the
context
of
all
the
cases
dealing
with
this
problem,
including
denman
and
slayton
and
helvering
against
independent
life
insurance
company.
i
don't
think
the
congress
said,
well
you
take
one
particular
case
and
extrapolate
a
rule
from
the
language
of
that
case
without
reading
it
in
its
context
where
we
read
cases
in
our
laws
to
read
them
in
the
over
all
context
of
the
parented
decision.
mr.
archibald
cox
by
adding
the
clause,
they
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
bulk
of
the
congress
thought
that
this
was
not
a
tax
on.
after
all,
if
the
bulk
of
the
congress
had
thought
that
this
was
a
tax
on
income
from
state
bonds.
why
under
this
--
under
--
they
enact
a
formula
particularly
in
the
gain
from
operations
formula
because
if
the
congress
subjectively
thought
that
under
the
gain
from
operations
formula,
the
formula
resulted
in
a
tax
on
state
bonds.
there
was
no
earthly
sense
in
writing
it
into
the
statute.
under
the
gain
from
operations
formula,
every
time,
if
there's
a
tax
on
state
bonds
in
any
instance
under
the
gain
from
operation
formula,
there's
a
tax
on
state
bonds
in
every
instance
and
everybody
knew
that.
there
was
no
doubt
in
anyone's
mind
about
what
the
arithmetical
result
of
this
formula.
the
only
question
that
anybody
could
have
felt
uncertain
about
was
what
was
meant
by
imposition
of
a
tax
on
state
bonds.
and
the
majority
as
they
explained
in
the
committee
report
felt
that
this
wasn't
a
tax
on
state
bonds
but
they
were
willing
to
say
if
we're
wrong,
then
we're
willing
to
have
the
courts
decide
it.
and
if
we
are
wrong
then
we
shall
make
an
adjustment.
indeed,
the
first
fallacy
as
we
see
it
--
well
let
me
state
a
little
more
clearly
what
we
understand
to
be
the
respondent's
argument.
the
respondent
says
that
if
the
formula
including
the
state
bond
interest
results
in
the
imposition
of
a
higher
tax
than
if
you
excluded
the
receipt
of
the
state
bond
interest
and
left
everything
else
the
same
then
it
says
there
is
a
tax
on
state
bonds.
now
i
say
that
if
that
is
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
exception
clause
as
applied
to
--
in
gain
from
operations,
then
the
formula
that
congress
enacted
in
the
gain
from
operations
section,
never
can
have
any
operation
because
that
will
be
the
arithmetical
result
in
every
single
case.
when
we
say
to
the
respondent,
why
did
congress
enact
this
formula,
there
answer
is,
“oh
well,
its
part
of
the
gain
from
operation
clause.”
there
answer
is,
“oh
well,
congress
didn't
understand
its
formula.”
it
didn't
mean
what
it
did.
well,
in
the
first
place,
i
submit
that
one
cannot
interpret
it
--
interpret
something
as
specific
as
this
formula
in
the
statute
on
the
assumption
that
congress
didn't
understand
it
and
to
give
effect
to
some
general
language
such
as
the
exception
clause.
and
in
the
second
place,
the
legislative
history
as
quoted
in
our
brief
and
describe
there,
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
congress
did
understand
the
arithmetical
computation.
it
was
explained
over
and
over
again.
it
was
explained
by
the
very
committee
that
put
the
exception
clause
into
the
statute
of
the
only
evidence
that
is
quoted
to
the
contrary
are
general
statements
saying
that
we
do
not
intend
to
impose
a
tax
on
state
bonds.
well
those
statements
don't
advance
the
argument
because
the
--
those
in
favor
of
the
statute
said
that
there
wasn't
a
tax
on
state
bonds.
we
think
the
only
coherent
explanation
that
can
be
put
on
the
exception
clause
is
the
one
i
suggested.
the
second
fallacy
in
the
argument
that
submitted
by
respondents
we
think
is
the
suggestion
that
their
interpretation
must
be
adopted
in
order
to
avoid
having
a
repressive
effect
on
the
municipal
bond
part.
the
--
we
think
that
this
argument
has
no
merit
because
it
was
carefully
explained
to
the
congress
that
the
1959
statute,
if
anything,
would
probably
make
municipal
bonds
more
attractive
to
life
insurance
companies
as
a
whole
then
they
were
under
the
1942
statute,
in
other
words,
than
they
had
been
for
17
years.
not
only
was
that
explained
as
being
something
that
would
happen
treating
the
industry
as
a
whole
but
so
far
as
one
can
judge
from
the
figure
that
is
the
very
thing
that
has
happened.
in
each
of
the
five
years
since
the
enactment
of
the
1959
statute,
insurance
companies
have
had
a
larger
proportion
of
their
assets
in
municipal
bonds
than
they
had
in
any
of
the
five
years
proceeding
reenactment
of
the
statute.
not
only
that
but
the
--
taking
that
each
five
years
as
an
average
of
the
post
statute
ratio
was
26%
higher
than
the
pre-statute
ratio.
now
there
may
have
been
other
reasons.
i
don't
suggest
for
a
minute
that
this
is
the
only
factor,
but
we
do
explain
in
our
reply
brief
that
this
one
could
expect
to
be
the
natural
tendency
of
the
59
statute
as
compared
with
the
42
statute
which
was
what
congress
would
replace.
our
third
reason
which
goes
both
to
the
constitutional
argument
and
to
any
question
of
statutory
interpretation
for
thinking
that
respondent's
formula
is
insufficient
is
that
you
simply
cannot
determine
what
a
tax
is
on
when
you're
talking
about
net
income
by
the
simplicity
“but
for”
rule.
now
suppose
that
a
taxpayer
has
$5000
of
income
from
each
of
five
sources,
a,
b,
c
and
d
and
he
has
$20,000
of
deduction
that
leaves
$5000
to
be
taxed.
respondent
says,
“well,
we
determine
whether
the
tax
is
on
the
$5000
that
came
from
source
a
by
excluding
that
$5000
leaving
everything
else
the
same
and
seeing
if
there
will
be
a
tax
but
there
won't
be
because
you
then
have
only
$20,000
of
income,
$20,000
of
deduction
and
so
the
respondent's
argument
runs,
the
tax
must
be
on
source
a.”
well
let's
apply
the
same
formula
to
source
b.
eliminate
the
$5000
from
source
b
while
leaving
the
$5000
from
a
and
you
again
have
nothing
left
so
the
tax
must
be
on
source
b.
you
can
do
the
same
with
c
and
you
find
that
the
tax
must
be
on
c
with
d
and
with
e.
well
this
of
course
is
an
absurdity.
the
tax
can't
be
on
the
$5000
from
each
of
the
five
sources
because
there's
only
$5000
that's
taxed.
and
it
doesn't
change
the
case
to
suppose
that
source
b
is
municipal
bond,
the
logic
and
the
fallacy
in
the
logic
are
exactly
the
same.
that
leads
to
our
next
objection.
we
know
no
where
that
the
“but
for”
rule
is
applied
in
tax
law
or
accounting
or
in
any
other
field
of
law
having
to
do
with
this
problem
of
allocation.
the
fourth
or
fifth
reason
for
our
quarreling
with
the
respondent's
approach
is
that
it
requires
the
court
to
make
or
assumes
that
congress
have
to
make
the
fantastic
assumption
that
if
the
respondent
had
not
had
the
income
for
municipal
bond
then
everything
else
would
have
remained
the
same.
that
could
have
happened,
it
could
have
happened
if
respondent
had
been
so
foolish
as
to
leave
something
like
the
million
dollars
that
produced
its
$36,000
of
municipal
bond
interest
as
idle
cash
but
he
wouldn't
have
survive
very
long
if
he'd
than
that.
it
could
have
happened
if
all
the
municipalities
and
bonds
it
bought
had
defaulted
but
that's
most
--
in
most
of
them
likely.
the
real
choice
is
open
to
the
respondent
if
it
wasn't
going
to
have
the
municipal
bond
interest
were
two.
one
was
to
put
the
money
into
something
else
and
its
tax
under
the
government's
formula
would
be
higher
if
he
put
the
money
into
something
else.
the
other
choice
that
it
had
would
have
been
to
curtail
its
operation
so
that
he
didn't
have
so
much
money
paid
in
his
premiums
by
the
policyholder.
it
would
borrow
less
and
therefore
it
would
have
to
make
a
smaller
addition
to
the
reserve
and
in
that
event
its
tax
would
be
exactly
the
same
as
if
it
hadn't
borrowed
the
money
allocable
to
the
obtaining
of
the
interest
from
the
state
bonds
and
that
would
be
exactly
the
way
the
tax
comes
out
here.
but
there
assumption
i
submit
has
no
reality
in
terms
of
the
business
world
and
certainly
was
not
from
the
congress
would
require
to
make.
finally,
i
turn
to
the
cases.
i
discussed
before
lunch
the
first
case
and
the
one
that
the
respondent
pitches
its
--
states
its
whole
case
on,
the
national
life
insurance
company
against
the
united
states.
and
i
sought
to
show
then
that
that
case
was
distinguishable
both
in
practical
result
and
in
legal
theory.
in
practical
result,
the
statute
involved
in
the
national
life
case
denied
a
tax
state
insurance
company
on
the
same
dollars
of
income
regardless
of
how
much
of
its
income
was
derived
from
tax
free
bond.
our
statute
as
i
showed
before
plainly
does
not
do
that.
every
dollar
you
shift
in
to
tax
free
bond
results
in
a
proportionate
reduction
in
the
income
tax.
second,
in
terms
of
legal
theory,
it
cannot
be
said
in
our
case
as
it
was
said
and
was
properly
said
in
national
life
that
the
company
that
has
municipal
bonds,
tax
free
securities
was
not
denied
the
same
--
was
not
allowed
the
same
treatment
given
to
other
taxpayers
because
other
taxpayers
were
allowed
to
deduct
the
full
cost
of
earning
the
taxable
interest.
whereas
under
the
1921
statute,
a
company
that
had
municipal
bonds
was
not
allowed
to
deduct
the
full
cost
of
earning
the
taxable
interest.
under
our
statute
it
is.
oh,
i
think
that
makes
the
case
clearly
distinguishable.
now
gehner
did
not
allow
apportionment
in
taxing
the
net
worth
of
an
insurance
company.
it
said
that
you
can't
apportion
part
of
the
liabilities
to
the
tax-exempt
assets.
we
think
that
the
dissenting
opinion
by
justice
stone
in
which
justices
holmes
and
brandeis
concurred
is
the
far
more
persuasive.
we've
emphasized
the
number
of
distinctions
taken
the
case
as
suppressed
in
our
brief.
the
prime
one
i
think
is
that
that
was
a
property
tax
and
this
problem
of
apportionment
is
--
and
limitation
of
deductible
cost
is
well
established
in
imposing
a
net
income
tax.
it
has
not
been
treated
the
same
way,
i
think
is
not
as
familiar
in
dealing
with
a
tax
on
property.
furthermore,
the
tax
on
property
of
course
was
ought
to
make
far
more
direct
tax
on
the
municipal
bonds
anyway
than
a
net
income
tax.
but
finally,
whatever
doubt
gehner
it
might
have
left,
i
submit
that
the
decisions
in
denman
and
slayton
and
in
helvering
against
independent
life
insurance
company
make
it
apparent
that
missouri
and
gehner
does
not
apply
here.
and
that
the
principle
of
apportionment
and
of
limiting
deductible
cost
to
the
cost
of
earning
the
taxable
income
is
a
sound
one
in
accordance
with
constitutional
law
and
indeed
in
accordance
with
the
general
principles
of
income
taxation.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
direct
myself
simply
to
two
specific
points.
first,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
once
again
that
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
or
a
departure
from
normal
tax
principle
in
the
allocation
of
cost
to
particular
kinds
of
income
that
we
urge
here.
section
265
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
since
1934,
has
imposed
a
tax
on
one
who
will
receive
state
bond
interest
in
the
sense
in
which
they
use
the
expression
greater
than
he
would
have
had
to
pay
if
he
hadn't
received
the
state
bond
interest
because
his
investment
advice,
because
of
running
his
office,
the
rent
that
he
pays
on
his
safe
deposit
box
must
be
allocated
under
section
265
and
he
may
deduct
only
the
part
allocable
to
his
taxable
investment
interest.
that's
done
everyday
buying
a
--
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
every
taxpayer
who
is
in
this
situation.
the
second
point
to
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
is
the
suggestion
made
by
mr.
darrell
in
his
oral
argument
and
then
his
brief
and
i
take
it
from
the
brief
in
order
to
be
accurate.
no
member
of
the
committee
questions
the
soundness
of
the
policy
of
complete
exemption
long
followed
by
congress
and
by
complete
exemption,
he
means
first
deducting
all
the
state
bond
interest
and
then
deducting
from
what
is
left
the
total
amount
of
the
annual
addition
to
the
reserve
for
policyholders
including
what
we
would
say
was
the
part
fairly
allocable
to
the
state
bond
interest.
now
the
first
time
a
congressional
committee
objected
to
that
was
back
in
the
revenue
act
of
19
--
enacting
the
revenue
act
of
1942
where
they
referred
to
this
as
a
double
deduction
and
they
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
revenue
act
of
1942
was
by
a
system
of
peroration
to
eliminate
that
double
deduction.
our
brief
in
one
of
the
early
pages
refers
to
that
committee
report.
second,
no
member
of
the
committee
may
have
said
this
during
the
hearings.
the
senate
finance
committee
made
it
perfectly
clear
in
its
report
quoted
on
page
69
of
our
brief.
it
said,
your
committee
believes
the
division
of
income
and
expense
items
between
the
policyholders
and
the
insurance
company
with
only
the
latter
being
taken
into
account
for
tax
purposes
is
a
much
better
concept
to
follow.
it
also
makes
it
clear
that
the
items
which
are
properly
exempt
or
deductible
such
as
tax-exempt
state
and
municipal
bond
interest,
partially
tax-exempt
federal
bond
interest,
85%
of
the
corporate
dividends
received
are
properly
divided
between
the
policyholders
and
the
insurance
company.
and
that
so
far
as
the
latter
the
insurance
company
is
concerned,
the
only
portion
including
in
the
tax
base
that
each
had,
full
allowance
is
made
for
those
items
by
deducting
the
proportionate
part
of
it.
and
this
was
explained
by
senator
curtis
on
the
senate
floor.
it
was
explained
by
senator
byrd,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
on
the
senate
floor
who
read
a
letter
from
the
treasury,
saying
that
there
was
no
objection
to
the
inclusion
of
the
exception
clause
because
in
the
treasury's
view,
the
formula
did
not
impose
a
tax
on
state
bond
interest.
so
congress
knows
perfectly
well
what
the
effect
of
this
formula
was
arithmetically
going
to
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
would
say
that
if
there
is
no
tax
on
income
within
the
meaning
of
103,
there
was
really
no
argument
left
as
to
whether
this
tax
went
beyond
the
con
--
the
assumed
constitutional
immunity.
mr.
archibald
cox
(voice

mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
you
would
have
to
decide
whether
this
is
a
tax
on
state
bond
interest
for
the
purposes
of
the
basic
constitutional
doctrine
that
a
tax
may
not
be
imposed
on
state
bond
interest.
i've
seen
no
way
of
escaping
that
much
of
a
constitutional
question.
what
i
meant
to
say
justice
brennan
and
perhaps
i
misspoke
myself
was
that
if
this
did
not
impose
a
tax
on
state
bond
interest
contrary
to
103
then
i
thought
it
was
really
clear
that
it
was
not
a
tax
on
state
bond
interest
for
the
purposes
of
the
constitutional
doctrine.
i
did
misspeak
myself
earlier
and
i
mean
what
i
said
on
the
second
case.
thank
you.
