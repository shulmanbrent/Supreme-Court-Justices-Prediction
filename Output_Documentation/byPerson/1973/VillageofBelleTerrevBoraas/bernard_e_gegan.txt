mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
village
of
belle
terre
and
the
named
individual
defendants
in
this
action
on
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
that
judgment
held
unconstitutional,
a
portion
of
the
zoning
law
of
the
village.
the
portion
that
it
held
unconstitutional
provided
that;
number
one,
the
village
has
a
one-family
zone.
the
court
did
not
dispute
that,
but
families
defined
in
terms
of
two
--
of
a
family-related
by
blood,
adoption
or
marriage
or
an
unrelated
individuals
living
in
a
household,
but
are
not
in
excess
of
two.
the
village
of
belle
terre
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
according
to
the
ordinance,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
according
to
this
ordinance,
that
is
just
so,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
your
honor.
the
village
of
belle
terre
is
a
small
community
of
700
people
approximately
on
the
north
shore
of
long
island
in
suffolk
county.
the
plaintiffs,
the
dickmans
own
a
house
within
the
village
and
rented
it
to
six
students
of
the
state
university
at
stony
brook.
the
village
threatened
to
enforce
its
ordinance
with
attendant
criminal
penalties
against
these
individuals
and
they
commenced
the
action
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
they
were,
that
was
in
their
complaint,
so
alleged,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
apparently,
one
was
a
female,
your
honor,
yes.
pending
this
appeal,
i
was
informed
that
these
students
had
left
and
so
stated
in
my
brief.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
not
all
of
them,
your
honor.
some
of
them
were.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
we
have
no
knowledge
of
why
they
left,
your
honor.
i
am
updated
by
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs,
as
they
state
in
their
supplemental
brief
that
they
have
been
replaced
by
six
more
unrelated
adults.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
so,
we
are
now
back
in
that
position.
i
would
like
in
the
beginning
to
proceed
from
the
general
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
they
are
not
parties
to
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
it
is
not
a
class
action,
your
honor.
it
was
an
individual
action.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
i
think
insofar
as
the
case
could
be
thought
to
be
moot
this
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
the
dickmans
have
continued
to
be
plaintiffs
throughout
and
have
never
withdrawn
or
left.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
they
are
the
owners
of
the
house
and
are
co-plaintiffs
and
their
interests
have
been
continuous
and
now
of
course,
they've
been
revived
by
the
new
group
of
unrelated
persons.
in
discussing
the
constitutionality
of
the
law,
i
would
like
to
proceed,
if
i
may
from
the
general
to
the
particular.
i
would
begin
by
stating
what
i
would
like
to
think
of
as
a
starting
point
for
analysis
of
the
issues
here
that
laid
down
in
euclid
v.
ambler,
that
a
state
may
legitimately
have
a
one-family
zone
as
sep
--
community,
may
legitimately
have
a
one-family
zone
as
distinguished
from
a
two-family
detached,
as
distinguished
from
apartments,
commercial,
light
industrial
and
so
on
down
the
line.
if
that
is
true,
and
if
the
one-family
zone
which
this
town
has
a
right
to
enact,
if
the
one-family
zone
is
to
have
any
meaning,
you
have
the
problem
of
an
unlimited
number
of
persons
assembling
under
the
roof
in
the
one-family
house.
i
suppose
the
village
has
a
couple
of
alternatives.
it
could
just
forget
about
its
one-family
zone
and
have
no
limit
on
the
number
of
people
of
any
type
that
could
live
in
a
building.
i
don't
think
it's
required
to
throw
out
its
one-family
zoning.
or
as
plaintiffs
suggest
in
their
brief,
they
could
have
an
across
the
broad
limit,
a
maximum
number
of
people
can
live
in
the
house
according
to
the
number
of
bedrooms
or
some
other
formula.
across
the
board!
the
consequences
of
this
suggestion
would
be
to
penalize
larger
families,
families
with
children
for
example
in
excess
of
the
number
of
bedrooms
in
the
house.
whether
it
would
be
constitutional
for
a
village
to
do
this,
i
don't
even
discuss.
certainly,
a
village
as
at
liberty
not
to
make
that
policy
judgment.
at
this
point,
i
think
we
come
to
the
crux
issues
in
the
case.
are
there
any
circumstances
in
which
the
village
can
treat
the
family
because
of
what
it
is,
because
of
the
value
it
has
for
our
society,
can
it
treat
the
family
different
from
the
unrelated
group.
and
the
third
alternative
is
the
one
the
village
adapted
here,
to
have
a
numerical
limitation
on
the
number
of
unrelated
people,
but
no
numerical
limitation
on
families
counting
on
the
normal
expectancy
that
families
tend
to
remain
within
a
certain
range,
whereas
there
is
no
such
expectancy
or
predictable
size
of
group
in
the
case
of
unrelated
individuals.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
and
i
--
on
that
point,
the
plaintiffs
make
something
of
that
in
that
their
argument
is
that
if
belle
terre
can
do
it,
so
can
everybody
else
and
unrelated
groups
might
find
themselves
eventually
deprived
of
convenient
and
fitting
places
to
live.
addressing
myself
just
to
that
question,
your
honor,
i
first
wish
to
reemphasize,
there
were
two
issues.
one,
is
the
village
appropriately
zoned
for
what
it
is.
second,
what
body
has
the
right
to
make
the
zoning
decision?
this
is
the
point
that
the
plaintiffs
challenge
on
this
branch
of
the
case.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
no.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
administrative
machinery.
it
is
a
fixed
zone,
no
variance.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
well,
it
derives
it
directly
from
state
law
under
the
new
york
state
village
law.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
well,
the
way
it
works,
your
honor
is
that
the
town
has
zoning
power,
but
if
the
village
incorporates
within
the
geographic
area
of
a
town,
it
then
acquires
zoning
power
over
its
area.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
without
reference
to
the
town,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
village
is
not
an
incorporated
village,
the
town's
zoning
is
applicable.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
no,
not
within
these
villages.
it's
just
single-family
houses,
residential.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
700
people,
your
honor
and
approximately
220
homes.
the
consequences
of
the
plaintiffs'
argument
on
this
branch
of
the
case
apparently
would
be
and
i
can’t
see
anyway
around
it
that
they
would
say,
it's
unconstitutional
to
have
a
governmental
entity
endowed
with
zoning
power
unless
that
governmental
body
itself
could
accommodate
the
full
range
of
zoning
uses.
this
--
just
the
argument
is
that
since
belle
terre
consists
solely
of
one-family
residences.
it
shouldn't
be
able
to
zone
unless
it
can
accommodate
other
users.
this
is
a
--
an
astonishing
proposition
that
would
render
innumerable
zoning
ordinances
all
across
the
country
unconstitutional.
it
would
negate
the
value
of
local
economy
which
this
court
so
recently
emphasized
in
the
san
antonio
school
district
case.
why
this
astonishing
conclusion
is
pressed
on
this
court
apparently
is
that
the
plaintiff's
belief
that
if
belle
terre
is
allowed
to
have
its
one
family
zone,
then
other
communities
will
zone
them
out.
mind
you,
the
argument
is
not
that
this
is
the
present
situation.
on
the
contrary,
judge
dooling
made
his
finding
of
fact
down
below,
that
belle
terre
is
a
tiny
unit
within
a
large
area
of
permissibly
zoned
area.
he
made
the
finding
that
the
town
of
brook
haven
within
which
the
university
is
and
within
which
the
village
is,
that
the
town
of
brook
haven,
even
its
highest
zoning
district
would
accommodate
the
residential
use
engaged
in
by
the
plaintiff
students.
so
the
argument
is
not
that
under
the
present
existing
circumstances,
the
students
have
been
deprived
of
a
meaningful
and
appropriate
place
to
reside.
the
argument
is
that
it
might
become
so
in
the
future.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
accepted
this
argument.
i
think
this
turns
upside
down,
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
we
have
a
tradition
that
if
any
state
of
facts
might
be
conceived,
that
would
make
the
operation
of
a
law
reasonable
then
the
law
is
valid.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
upside
down
that
if
any
state
of
facts
might
be
conceived
in
future
by
which
the
operation
of
a
law
become
unreasonable,
then
the
law
must
be
held
valid,
void,
presently.
now
of
course,
the
village
of
belle
terre
excludes
two-family
houses,
but
no
one
is
in
a
panic
thinking
that
havens,
if
belle
terre
excludes
two-family
houses,
there'll
be
no
place
for
two-family
houses.
the
plaintiff
group
consisting
of
unrelated
people
is
not
the
kind
of
suspect
minority
which
this
court
contemplated
in
the
old
caroline
products
case,
footnote
4.
they
are
numerous.
they
are
articulate.
they
are
educated.
they
are
mobile
in
the
sense
that
members
of
this
group
become
members
of
families
and
back
and
forth.
so,
they
are
the
very
opposite
of
the
kind
of
helpless
minority
in
whose
behalf,
strict
or
special
judicial
scrutiny
is
invoked.
the
plaintiffs
on
--
at
a
couple
of
points
in
their
brief
try
to
impute
to
the
village
some
sort
of
judgment
that
individuals
living
in
group
are
per
se
socially
undesirable.
i
suppose,
they
are
trying
to
come
close
to
the
marino
case
recently
decided
by
this
court
which
said
that
the
state
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
punishing
politically
unpopular
groups.
well
of
course,
that
would
be
the
antithesis
of
a
bill
of
attainder
and
no
one
would
assert
that
as
a
constitutionally
permissible
purpose.
but
this
kind
of
division
that
they
try
to
impute
to
the
village,
that
we
in
the
village,
the
families
are
the
good
guys
and
groups
are
somehow
the
bad
guys,
the
social
undesirables
that
are
excluded,
that
are
out.
this
distorts
totally
the
kind
of
fine-tuned
judgments
that
are
made
in
zoning.
if
you
have
a
zone
for
one-family
residential
community,
that
does
not
express
a
judgment
that
people
living
in
two-family
houses
are
undesirables.
it
excludes
a
monastery,
50
monks
living
in
it.
there's
no
judgment
that
the
50
monks
are
undesirables.
it's
a
rather
fine-tuned
judgment
that
certain
users
are
more
appropriately
put
off
into
one
zone.
the
plaintiffs
use
the
epithet
separate
but
equal.
well
an
epithet
has
an
odium
connected
with
it
because
of
its
legal
history.
but
logically,
the
concept
separate
but
equal,
i
must
admit,
is
the
concept
of
zoning.
i
think
in
this
case
that
of
all
of
the
opinions
written
below,
the
most
acute
statement
was
that
of
judge
dooling
in
the
district
court,
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
page
88,
in
which
he
said,
"the
essence
of
zoning
is
that
its
selection
is
not
regarded
as
invidiously
discriminatory
against
users
not
selected.
zoning
presupposes
that
convenient
and
fitting
locations
can
be
found
for
every
legitimate
land
use
so
that
no
pursuit
of
any
use
is
denied
of
disparaged."
now,
you
can
call
that
separate,
but
equal
if
you
will,
but
that's
what
it
is.
the
exclusion
of
one
land
use
from
zone
x
is
not
the
kind
of
invidious
judgment
that
excluding
unrelated
groups
from
food
stamp
programs
is.
to
exclude
unrelated
groups
from
food
stamp
programs
does
not
put
any
bread
and
nourishment
in
the
stomachs
of
families.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
would
say
in
candor,
however
that
my
basic
principle
rests
to
a
certain
degree
on
the
concept
of
density.
i
think
density
certainly
explains
the
general
concept
of
why
a
village
would
want
to
put
in
numerical
limit
on
the
number
of
unrelated
people
while
leaving
traditional
families
without
a
numerical
limit.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
among
other,
definitely
one,
your
honor.
one
of
the
rational
perceived
grounds
upon
which
this
distinction
would
be
made.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
i
think
that
is
exactly
so
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes.
i
do
feel
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
one
of
the
problems
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
we
feel
your
honor,
this
way.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
village
has
not
proved
the
existence
of
problems
whether
it'd
be
problems
of
transiency
and
community
stability,
whether
it
be
problems
of
density,
or
whether
it
be
problems
in
the
ability
of
families
to
compete
for
the
rental
of
a
house
against
six
wage
earners.
these
were
the
various
reasons
the
village
endorsed.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
even
go
that
far,
but
i
do
stand
here
strongly
objecting
to
the
notion
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
village
somehow
had
to
prove,
as
if
it
were
an
adjudicative
fact
to
be
proved
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
facts
underlying
--
the
legislative
facts
underlying
its
ordinance.
to
the
contrary,
we
insisted
there
and
we
ins
--
we
went
back
to
the
district
court
and
refused
to
put
in
any
further
facts
and
we
insist
here
that
so
long
as
the
state
of
facts
which
the
village
apprehends
is
rationally
arguable,
which
reasonable
men
could
perceive
that
if
we
don't
have
this
ordinance,
certain
problems
will
develop,
that
that
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance.
we
don't
even
ask
the
court
to
exercise
sua
sponte
imagination
to
impute
purposes
to
the
village.
the
village
comes
before
you
tendering
legitimate,
reasonable
public
purposes
which
underlie
the
statute.
the
fact
that
the
number
of
unrelated
persons
can't
exceed
two
might
be
thought
harsh
if
density
were
the
only
rationale
underlying
this
ordinance.
that
is
why
the
village
has
other
rational
basis
underlying
this
ordinance.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
i
would
certainly
feel
uncomfortable
with
it
and
i
don't
want
to
carry
that
burden.
so,
to
justify
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
one
acre.
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
to
justify
the
number
of
two
as
applied
to
groups
of
unrelated
individuals,
it
seems
obvious
to
us
that
we
have
an
economic
problem
staring
us
in
the
face.
we
are
15
minutes
away
as
the
affidavit
show
from
stony
brook
university,
a
large
unit
of
a
state
university
and
a
particular
number
and
i
asked
you
your
honors
to
notice
it,
is
some
12,000
odd
students.
they
have
more
faculty
than
we
have
residents.
so,
there
is
potentially
tremendous
supply
of
unrelated
individuals
who
would
be
ready
to
form
groups
were
this
ordinance
not
existing
and
we
argue
that
the
legitimate
interest
in
rental
parity
and
equity
between
a
family
which
has
one
wage
earner
or
at
most
two
wage
earners
would
be
priced
out
of
the
rental
market
if
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
had
tried
to
make
two
basic
points.
first,
the
general
proposition
that
the
village
has
a
legitimate
interest,
being
zoned
as
a
one-family
community,
a
legitimate
interest
in
imposing
some
kind
of
limit
on
a
number
of
unrelated
people
who
may
aggregate
together
under
the
roof
of
one
private
residence.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
that
is
the
particular
figure
set
by
the
village,
your
honor,
and
yet,
at
the
same
time,
an
equally
legitimate
interest
in
not
imposing
the
same
kind
of
numerical
limit
on
the
occupancy
of
a
traditional
family.
that’s
the
basic
principle,
but
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
our
village
has
a
limit
of
two.
additional
public
purposes
are
particularly
relevant
to
the
number
two.
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
village
in
equalizing
the
competitive
position
of
families
seeking
to
rent
a
residence
with
an
aggregation
of
unrelated
individuals
seeking
to
rent
a
residence.
families
have
usually
one
income,
perhaps
two
incomes.
whereas,
a
group
of
unrelated
individuals,
each
eating
separate
--
leading
separate
lives
can
have
a
pooling
of
far
greater
financial
resources
and
could
easily
bid
a
family
out
of
any
market
to
occupy
a
residence.
the
case
of
dandridge
against
williams
turned
in
part
on
a
similar
consideration.
the
ceiling
in
that
case,
put
on
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children,
was
justified
by
a
parity
between
what
a
welfare
family
would
be
earning
and
what
a
wage-earning
family
would
be
earning.
indeed,
this
is
an
easier
case
than
dandridge,
because
in
dandridge
the
classification
placed
at
a
disadvantage
the
under-privileged
group
whereas
in
our
case
the
classification
seeks
to
benefit
and
give
a
break
and
a
parity
to
the
entity
that
would
otherwise
be
at
a
disadvantage,
namely
the
family.
this
seems
obvious
to
us,
yet
the
plaintiffs
have
suggested
that
this
is
not
a
real
concern
of
the
village,
that
it’s
a
fictitious,
a
spurious
concern.
i
don’t
know
where
they
get
their
crystal
ball
to
make
such
an
assertion,
but
i’m
here
to
tell
you
that
the
village
has
a
legitimate
and
real
governmental
concern
with
this
problem.
we
are
15
minutes
from
the
state
university
at
stony
brook
which
has
a
potential
of
thousands
of
unrelated
people.
the
exact
figure
at
stony
brook
is
not
in
the
record,
but
it’s
a
matter
of
public
record
so
it
could
be
judicially
noticed,
over
12,000
students
are
at
stony
brook.
several
--
a
few
houses
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
dickman
house
have
already
been
rented
at
about
$350
a
month.
the
dickman
house,
which
is
rented
to
the
group
of
students,
rents
at
$500
a
month.
the
disparity
is
there,
and
under
the
law
of
supply
and
demand,
houses
that
are
not
presently
on
the
rental
market
can
come
on
the
rental
market
once
it
is
seen
that
we
have
an
abundant
demand
on
the
part
of
unrelated
people
who
are
willing
to
pay
plenty
to
occupy
a
one-family
residence.
the
last
major
public
purpose
underlying
this
ordinance
is
the
community’s
legitimate
interest
in
stability.
if
it
may
reasonably
be
thought
that
groups
of
unrelated
people
tend
to
be
more
transient
and
provide
a
less
stable
community,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
a
one-family
zone
limited
primarily
to
families
and
small
twosomes
of
unrelated
people
promote
this
additional
legitimate
interest.
indeed,
on
the
point
of
stability,
one
need
only
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
appendix
page
11.
the
plaintiffs’
own
allegations
were
that
it
was
never
planned
that
these
students
would
be
permanent
residents.
two
of
them
were
on
the
lease.
four
of
them
were
not
on
the
lease,
and
it
was
contemplated
that
they
would
come
and
go.
the
only
constant
thing
was
that
the
total
would
remain
at
six.
so,
this
is
clearly
a
more
transient
situation
than
family
occupancy.
the
plaintiffs
say
that
we
live
in
a
mobile
society
and
even
families
move,
and
they
cite
some
figures,
but
those
are
gross
figures.
they
don’t
give
a
breakdown
as
between
families,
non-families,
people
who
rent,
people
who
own.
your
honor,
i’d
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes.
if
may,
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
well,
certainly,
we
don’t
believe
that
this
zoning
law,
which
is
the
most
local
of
matters,
interferes
with
the
right
to
travel.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
anything
would,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
i
only
pause
to
note
that
there’s
no
allegation
in
this
case
by
these
plaintiffs
that
they
engaged
in
interstate
travel
to
get
where
they
are.
the
census
data
which
seeks
to
indicate
that
families
are
on
the
average,
larger
than
unrelated
households
is
--
could
be
misleading.
the
bureau
of
the
census,
which
incidentally
defines
family
in
terms
of
blood,
marriage,
and
adoption,
defines
household
to
include
single
people
living
alone.
so,
of
course,
the
average
household
being
weighted
with
single
people
will
be
low.
so,
it’s
not
fair
to
compare
it
with
families
which
begin
with
two.
i
again
wish
to
say
that,
to
the
extent
that
the
one
family-zoning
ordinance
embodies
both
the
physical
benefits
and
the
social
well-being
of
family
organization.
i’ll
stand
by
that
principle
and
don’t
consider
it
an
illegitimate
purpose.
it
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
this
is
some
kind
of
a
morals
law
to
keep
out
undesirables.
the
recent
wisconsin
district
court
case
furnished
in
the
appellants
--
in
the
appellees’
green
supplemental
brief,
two
families
occupying
a
one-family
residence,
they
would
--
in
following
the
belle
terre
case,
the
district
judge
said
they
can’t
be
kept
out
under
the
zoning
law.
well,
if
that’s
not
the
end
of
one-family
zoning,
i
don’t
know
what
is,
and
it
certainly
has
nothing
to
do
with
keeping
out
undesirables.
and,
my
last
point
is
that
while
some
families
may
be
larger,
some
families
may
even
have
a
servant,
whereas,
a
group
of
three
spinsters
may
be
small.
euclid
against
ambler
itself
said
that
uses,
whether
it’s
a
boarding
house,
a
fraternity
house,
or
a
private
residence
occupied
by
a
group
of
individuals,
uses
tend
to
fade
into
each
other
by
imperceptible
gradations,
and
that
does
not
put
the
stamp
of
invalidity
on
a
zoning
ordinance
which
seeks
to
draw
some
reasonable
line
based
on
the
average
family.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
we
would
risk
the
possibility
that
the
court
might
interpret
six
students
living
in
a
private
residence
as
not
being
a
fraternity
house.
this
seeks
to
duck
the
eye
and
cross
the
case,
so
to
speak.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
the
primary
source
of
the
influx
into
belle
terre,
should
it
ever
happen,
i
anticipate
would
be
students,
but
the
ordinance,
itself,
covers
any,
as
i
say,
two
families
that
move
in
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
the
practical
source
of
unrelated
individuals
in
the
case
of
belle
terre
is
students,
but
the
ordinance
is
not
limited
to
students.
it’s
not
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
exactly
so,
your
honor,
and
i
would
only
conclude
by
saying
that
zoning
has
traditionally
been
–
been
considered
a
matter
of
local
responsibility
and
this
court
has
wisely
refrained
from
becoming
a
national
board
of
standards
and
appeals
to
hear
applications
--
bearings
has
been
zoned.
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
village
of
belle
terre
and
the
named
individual
defendants
in
this
action
on
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
that
judgment
held
unconstitutional,
a
portion
of
the
zoning
law
of
the
village.
the
portion
that
it
held
unconstitutional
provided
that;
number
one,
the
village
has
a
one-family
zone.
the
court
did
not
dispute
that,
but
families
defined
in
terms
of
two
--
of
a
family-related
by
blood,
adoption
or
marriage
or
an
unrelated
individuals
living
in
a
household,
but
are
not
in
excess
of
two.
the
village
of
belle
terre
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
according
to
the
ordinance,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
according
to
this
ordinance,
that
is
just
so,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
your
honor.
the
village
of
belle
terre
is
a
small
community
of
700
people
approximately
on
the
north
shore
of
long
island
in
suffolk
county.
the
plaintiffs,
the
dickmans
own
a
house
within
the
village
and
rented
it
to
six
students
of
the
state
university
at
stony
brook.
the
village
threatened
to
enforce
its
ordinance
with
attendant
criminal
penalties
against
these
individuals
and
they
commenced
the
action
in
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
they
were,
that
was
in
their
complaint,
so
alleged,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
apparently,
one
was
a
female,
your
honor,
yes.
pending
this
appeal,
i
was
informed
that
these
students
had
left
and
so
stated
in
my
brief.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
not
all
of
them,
your
honor.
some
of
them
were.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
we
have
no
knowledge
of
why
they
left,
your
honor.
i
am
updated
by
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs,
as
they
state
in
their
supplemental
brief
that
they
have
been
replaced
by
six
more
unrelated
adults.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
so,
we
are
now
back
in
that
position.
i
would
like
in
the
beginning
to
proceed
from
the
general
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
they
are
not
parties
to
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
it
is
not
a
class
action,
your
honor.
it
was
an
individual
action.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
i
think
insofar
as
the
case
could
be
thought
to
be
moot
this
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
the
dickmans
have
continued
to
be
plaintiffs
throughout
and
have
never
withdrawn
or
left.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
they
are
the
owners
of
the
house
and
are
co-plaintiffs
and
their
interests
have
been
continuous
and
now
of
course,
they've
been
revived
by
the
new
group
of
unrelated
persons.
in
discussing
the
constitutionality
of
the
law,
i
would
like
to
proceed,
if
i
may
from
the
general
to
the
particular.
i
would
begin
by
stating
what
i
would
like
to
think
of
as
a
starting
point
for
analysis
of
the
issues
here
that
laid
down
in
euclid
v.
ambler,
that
a
state
may
legitimately
have
a
one-family
zone
as
sep
--
community,
may
legitimately
have
a
one-family
zone
as
distinguished
from
a
two-family
detached,
as
distinguished
from
apartments,
commercial,
light
industrial
and
so
on
down
the
line.
if
that
is
true,
and
if
the
one-family
zone
which
this
town
has
a
right
to
enact,
if
the
one-family
zone
is
to
have
any
meaning,
you
have
the
problem
of
an
unlimited
number
of
persons
assembling
under
the
roof
in
the
one-family
house.
i
suppose
the
village
has
a
couple
of
alternatives.
it
could
just
forget
about
its
one-family
zone
and
have
no
limit
on
the
number
of
people
of
any
type
that
could
live
in
a
building.
i
don't
think
it's
required
to
throw
out
its
one-family
zoning.
or
as
plaintiffs
suggest
in
their
brief,
they
could
have
an
across
the
broad
limit,
a
maximum
number
of
people
can
live
in
the
house
according
to
the
number
of
bedrooms
or
some
other
formula.
across
the
board!
the
consequences
of
this
suggestion
would
be
to
penalize
larger
families,
families
with
children
for
example
in
excess
of
the
number
of
bedrooms
in
the
house.
whether
it
would
be
constitutional
for
a
village
to
do
this,
i
don't
even
discuss.
certainly,
a
village
as
at
liberty
not
to
make
that
policy
judgment.
at
this
point,
i
think
we
come
to
the
crux
issues
in
the
case.
are
there
any
circumstances
in
which
the
village
can
treat
the
family
because
of
what
it
is,
because
of
the
value
it
has
for
our
society,
can
it
treat
the
family
different
from
the
unrelated
group.
and
the
third
alternative
is
the
one
the
village
adapted
here,
to
have
a
numerical
limitation
on
the
number
of
unrelated
people,
but
no
numerical
limitation
on
families
counting
on
the
normal
expectancy
that
families
tend
to
remain
within
a
certain
range,
whereas
there
is
no
such
expectancy
or
predictable
size
of
group
in
the
case
of
unrelated
individuals.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
and
i
--
on
that
point,
the
plaintiffs
make
something
of
that
in
that
their
argument
is
that
if
belle
terre
can
do
it,
so
can
everybody
else
and
unrelated
groups
might
find
themselves
eventually
deprived
of
convenient
and
fitting
places
to
live.
addressing
myself
just
to
that
question,
your
honor,
i
first
wish
to
reemphasize,
there
were
two
issues.
one,
is
the
village
appropriately
zoned
for
what
it
is.
second,
what
body
has
the
right
to
make
the
zoning
decision?
this
is
the
point
that
the
plaintiffs
challenge
on
this
branch
of
the
case.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
no.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
administrative
machinery.
it
is
a
fixed
zone,
no
variance.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
well,
it
derives
it
directly
from
state
law
under
the
new
york
state
village
law.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
well,
the
way
it
works,
your
honor
is
that
the
town
has
zoning
power,
but
if
the
village
incorporates
within
the
geographic
area
of
a
town,
it
then
acquires
zoning
power
over
its
area.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
without
reference
to
the
town,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
village
is
not
an
incorporated
village,
the
town's
zoning
is
applicable.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
no,
not
within
these
villages.
it's
just
single-family
houses,
residential.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
700
people,
your
honor
and
approximately
220
homes.
the
consequences
of
the
plaintiffs'
argument
on
this
branch
of
the
case
apparently
would
be
and
i
can’t
see
anyway
around
it
that
they
would
say,
it's
unconstitutional
to
have
a
governmental
entity
endowed
with
zoning
power
unless
that
governmental
body
itself
could
accommodate
the
full
range
of
zoning
uses.
this
--
just
the
argument
is
that
since
belle
terre
consists
solely
of
one-family
residences.
it
shouldn't
be
able
to
zone
unless
it
can
accommodate
other
users.
this
is
a
--
an
astonishing
proposition
that
would
render
innumerable
zoning
ordinances
all
across
the
country
unconstitutional.
it
would
negate
the
value
of
local
economy
which
this
court
so
recently
emphasized
in
the
san
antonio
school
district
case.
why
this
astonishing
conclusion
is
pressed
on
this
court
apparently
is
that
the
plaintiff's
belief
that
if
belle
terre
is
allowed
to
have
its
one
family
zone,
then
other
communities
will
zone
them
out.
mind
you,
the
argument
is
not
that
this
is
the
present
situation.
on
the
contrary,
judge
dooling
made
his
finding
of
fact
down
below,
that
belle
terre
is
a
tiny
unit
within
a
large
area
of
permissibly
zoned
area.
he
made
the
finding
that
the
town
of
brook
haven
within
which
the
university
is
and
within
which
the
village
is,
that
the
town
of
brook
haven,
even
its
highest
zoning
district
would
accommodate
the
residential
use
engaged
in
by
the
plaintiff
students.
so
the
argument
is
not
that
under
the
present
existing
circumstances,
the
students
have
been
deprived
of
a
meaningful
and
appropriate
place
to
reside.
the
argument
is
that
it
might
become
so
in
the
future.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
accepted
this
argument.
i
think
this
turns
upside
down,
the
presumption
of
constitutionality.
we
have
a
tradition
that
if
any
state
of
facts
might
be
conceived,
that
would
make
the
operation
of
a
law
reasonable
then
the
law
is
valid.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
upside
down
that
if
any
state
of
facts
might
be
conceived
in
future
by
which
the
operation
of
a
law
become
unreasonable,
then
the
law
must
be
held
valid,
void,
presently.
now
of
course,
the
village
of
belle
terre
excludes
two-family
houses,
but
no
one
is
in
a
panic
thinking
that
havens,
if
belle
terre
excludes
two-family
houses,
there'll
be
no
place
for
two-family
houses.
the
plaintiff
group
consisting
of
unrelated
people
is
not
the
kind
of
suspect
minority
which
this
court
contemplated
in
the
old
caroline
products
case,
footnote
4.
they
are
numerous.
they
are
articulate.
they
are
educated.
they
are
mobile
in
the
sense
that
members
of
this
group
become
members
of
families
and
back
and
forth.
so,
they
are
the
very
opposite
of
the
kind
of
helpless
minority
in
whose
behalf,
strict
or
special
judicial
scrutiny
is
invoked.
the
plaintiffs
on
--
at
a
couple
of
points
in
their
brief
try
to
impute
to
the
village
some
sort
of
judgment
that
individuals
living
in
group
are
per
se
socially
undesirable.
i
suppose,
they
are
trying
to
come
close
to
the
marino
case
recently
decided
by
this
court
which
said
that
the
state
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
punishing
politically
unpopular
groups.
well
of
course,
that
would
be
the
antithesis
of
a
bill
of
attainder
and
no
one
would
assert
that
as
a
constitutionally
permissible
purpose.
but
this
kind
of
division
that
they
try
to
impute
to
the
village,
that
we
in
the
village,
the
families
are
the
good
guys
and
groups
are
somehow
the
bad
guys,
the
social
undesirables
that
are
excluded,
that
are
out.
this
distorts
totally
the
kind
of
fine-tuned
judgments
that
are
made
in
zoning.
if
you
have
a
zone
for
one-family
residential
community,
that
does
not
express
a
judgment
that
people
living
in
two-family
houses
are
undesirables.
it
excludes
a
monastery,
50
monks
living
in
it.
there's
no
judgment
that
the
50
monks
are
undesirables.
it's
a
rather
fine-tuned
judgment
that
certain
users
are
more
appropriately
put
off
into
one
zone.
the
plaintiffs
use
the
epithet
separate
but
equal.
well
an
epithet
has
an
odium
connected
with
it
because
of
its
legal
history.
but
logically,
the
concept
separate
but
equal,
i
must
admit,
is
the
concept
of
zoning.
i
think
in
this
case
that
of
all
of
the
opinions
written
below,
the
most
acute
statement
was
that
of
judge
dooling
in
the
district
court,
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
page
88,
in
which
he
said,
"the
essence
of
zoning
is
that
its
selection
is
not
regarded
as
invidiously
discriminatory
against
users
not
selected.
zoning
presupposes
that
convenient
and
fitting
locations
can
be
found
for
every
legitimate
land
use
so
that
no
pursuit
of
any
use
is
denied
of
disparaged."
now,
you
can
call
that
separate,
but
equal
if
you
will,
but
that's
what
it
is.
the
exclusion
of
one
land
use
from
zone
x
is
not
the
kind
of
invidious
judgment
that
excluding
unrelated
groups
from
food
stamp
programs
is.
to
exclude
unrelated
groups
from
food
stamp
programs
does
not
put
any
bread
and
nourishment
in
the
stomachs
of
families.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
would
say
in
candor,
however
that
my
basic
principle
rests
to
a
certain
degree
on
the
concept
of
density.
i
think
density
certainly
explains
the
general
concept
of
why
a
village
would
want
to
put
in
numerical
limit
on
the
number
of
unrelated
people
while
leaving
traditional
families
without
a
numerical
limit.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
among
other,
definitely
one,
your
honor.
one
of
the
rational
perceived
grounds
upon
which
this
distinction
would
be
made.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
i
think
that
is
exactly
so
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes.
i
do
feel
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
one
of
the
problems
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
we
feel
your
honor,
this
way.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
village
has
not
proved
the
existence
of
problems
whether
it'd
be
problems
of
transiency
and
community
stability,
whether
it
be
problems
of
density,
or
whether
it
be
problems
in
the
ability
of
families
to
compete
for
the
rental
of
a
house
against
six
wage
earners.
these
were
the
various
reasons
the
village
endorsed.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
even
go
that
far,
but
i
do
stand
here
strongly
objecting
to
the
notion
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
village
somehow
had
to
prove,
as
if
it
were
an
adjudicative
fact
to
be
proved
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
facts
underlying
--
the
legislative
facts
underlying
its
ordinance.
to
the
contrary,
we
insisted
there
and
we
ins
--
we
went
back
to
the
district
court
and
refused
to
put
in
any
further
facts
and
we
insist
here
that
so
long
as
the
state
of
facts
which
the
village
apprehends
is
rationally
arguable,
which
reasonable
men
could
perceive
that
if
we
don't
have
this
ordinance,
certain
problems
will
develop,
that
that
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance.
we
don't
even
ask
the
court
to
exercise
sua
sponte
imagination
to
impute
purposes
to
the
village.
the
village
comes
before
you
tendering
legitimate,
reasonable
public
purposes
which
underlie
the
statute.
the
fact
that
the
number
of
unrelated
persons
can't
exceed
two
might
be
thought
harsh
if
density
were
the
only
rationale
underlying
this
ordinance.
that
is
why
the
village
has
other
rational
basis
underlying
this
ordinance.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
i
would
certainly
feel
uncomfortable
with
it
and
i
don't
want
to
carry
that
burden.
so,
to
justify
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
one
acre.
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
to
justify
the
number
of
two
as
applied
to
groups
of
unrelated
individuals,
it
seems
obvious
to
us
that
we
have
an
economic
problem
staring
us
in
the
face.
we
are
15
minutes
away
as
the
affidavit
show
from
stony
brook
university,
a
large
unit
of
a
state
university
and
a
particular
number
and
i
asked
you
your
honors
to
notice
it,
is
some
12,000
odd
students.
they
have
more
faculty
than
we
have
residents.
so,
there
is
potentially
tremendous
supply
of
unrelated
individuals
who
would
be
ready
to
form
groups
were
this
ordinance
not
existing
and
we
argue
that
the
legitimate
interest
in
rental
parity
and
equity
between
a
family
which
has
one
wage
earner
or
at
most
two
wage
earners
would
be
priced
out
of
the
rental
market
if
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
had
tried
to
make
two
basic
points.
first,
the
general
proposition
that
the
village
has
a
legitimate
interest,
being
zoned
as
a
one-family
community,
a
legitimate
interest
in
imposing
some
kind
of
limit
on
a
number
of
unrelated
people
who
may
aggregate
together
under
the
roof
of
one
private
residence.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
that
is
the
particular
figure
set
by
the
village,
your
honor,
and
yet,
at
the
same
time,
an
equally
legitimate
interest
in
not
imposing
the
same
kind
of
numerical
limit
on
the
occupancy
of
a
traditional
family.
that’s
the
basic
principle,
but
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
our
village
has
a
limit
of
two.
additional
public
purposes
are
particularly
relevant
to
the
number
two.
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
village
in
equalizing
the
competitive
position
of
families
seeking
to
rent
a
residence
with
an
aggregation
of
unrelated
individuals
seeking
to
rent
a
residence.
families
have
usually
one
income,
perhaps
two
incomes.
whereas,
a
group
of
unrelated
individuals,
each
eating
separate
--
leading
separate
lives
can
have
a
pooling
of
far
greater
financial
resources
and
could
easily
bid
a
family
out
of
any
market
to
occupy
a
residence.
the
case
of
dandridge
against
williams
turned
in
part
on
a
similar
consideration.
the
ceiling
in
that
case,
put
on
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children,
was
justified
by
a
parity
between
what
a
welfare
family
would
be
earning
and
what
a
wage-earning
family
would
be
earning.
indeed,
this
is
an
easier
case
than
dandridge,
because
in
dandridge
the
classification
placed
at
a
disadvantage
the
under-privileged
group
whereas
in
our
case
the
classification
seeks
to
benefit
and
give
a
break
and
a
parity
to
the
entity
that
would
otherwise
be
at
a
disadvantage,
namely
the
family.
this
seems
obvious
to
us,
yet
the
plaintiffs
have
suggested
that
this
is
not
a
real
concern
of
the
village,
that
it’s
a
fictitious,
a
spurious
concern.
i
don’t
know
where
they
get
their
crystal
ball
to
make
such
an
assertion,
but
i’m
here
to
tell
you
that
the
village
has
a
legitimate
and
real
governmental
concern
with
this
problem.
we
are
15
minutes
from
the
state
university
at
stony
brook
which
has
a
potential
of
thousands
of
unrelated
people.
the
exact
figure
at
stony
brook
is
not
in
the
record,
but
it’s
a
matter
of
public
record
so
it
could
be
judicially
noticed,
over
12,000
students
are
at
stony
brook.
several
--
a
few
houses
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
dickman
house
have
already
been
rented
at
about
$350
a
month.
the
dickman
house,
which
is
rented
to
the
group
of
students,
rents
at
$500
a
month.
the
disparity
is
there,
and
under
the
law
of
supply
and
demand,
houses
that
are
not
presently
on
the
rental
market
can
come
on
the
rental
market
once
it
is
seen
that
we
have
an
abundant
demand
on
the
part
of
unrelated
people
who
are
willing
to
pay
plenty
to
occupy
a
one-family
residence.
the
last
major
public
purpose
underlying
this
ordinance
is
the
community’s
legitimate
interest
in
stability.
if
it
may
reasonably
be
thought
that
groups
of
unrelated
people
tend
to
be
more
transient
and
provide
a
less
stable
community,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
a
one-family
zone
limited
primarily
to
families
and
small
twosomes
of
unrelated
people
promote
this
additional
legitimate
interest.
indeed,
on
the
point
of
stability,
one
need
only
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
appendix
page
11.
the
plaintiffs’
own
allegations
were
that
it
was
never
planned
that
these
students
would
be
permanent
residents.
two
of
them
were
on
the
lease.
four
of
them
were
not
on
the
lease,
and
it
was
contemplated
that
they
would
come
and
go.
the
only
constant
thing
was
that
the
total
would
remain
at
six.
so,
this
is
clearly
a
more
transient
situation
than
family
occupancy.
the
plaintiffs
say
that
we
live
in
a
mobile
society
and
even
families
move,
and
they
cite
some
figures,
but
those
are
gross
figures.
they
don’t
give
a
breakdown
as
between
families,
non-families,
people
who
rent,
people
who
own.
your
honor,
i’d
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes.
if
may,
thank
you.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
well,
certainly,
we
don’t
believe
that
this
zoning
law,
which
is
the
most
local
of
matters,
interferes
with
the
right
to
travel.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
anything
would,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
i
only
pause
to
note
that
there’s
no
allegation
in
this
case
by
these
plaintiffs
that
they
engaged
in
interstate
travel
to
get
where
they
are.
the
census
data
which
seeks
to
indicate
that
families
are
on
the
average,
larger
than
unrelated
households
is
--
could
be
misleading.
the
bureau
of
the
census,
which
incidentally
defines
family
in
terms
of
blood,
marriage,
and
adoption,
defines
household
to
include
single
people
living
alone.
so,
of
course,
the
average
household
being
weighted
with
single
people
will
be
low.
so,
it’s
not
fair
to
compare
it
with
families
which
begin
with
two.
i
again
wish
to
say
that,
to
the
extent
that
the
one
family-zoning
ordinance
embodies
both
the
physical
benefits
and
the
social
well-being
of
family
organization.
i’ll
stand
by
that
principle
and
don’t
consider
it
an
illegitimate
purpose.
it
is
not
the
same
as
saying
that
this
is
some
kind
of
a
morals
law
to
keep
out
undesirables.
the
recent
wisconsin
district
court
case
furnished
in
the
appellants
--
in
the
appellees’
green
supplemental
brief,
two
families
occupying
a
one-family
residence,
they
would
--
in
following
the
belle
terre
case,
the
district
judge
said
they
can’t
be
kept
out
under
the
zoning
law.
well,
if
that’s
not
the
end
of
one-family
zoning,
i
don’t
know
what
is,
and
it
certainly
has
nothing
to
do
with
keeping
out
undesirables.
and,
my
last
point
is
that
while
some
families
may
be
larger,
some
families
may
even
have
a
servant,
whereas,
a
group
of
three
spinsters
may
be
small.
euclid
against
ambler
itself
said
that
uses,
whether
it’s
a
boarding
house,
a
fraternity
house,
or
a
private
residence
occupied
by
a
group
of
individuals,
uses
tend
to
fade
into
each
other
by
imperceptible
gradations,
and
that
does
not
put
the
stamp
of
invalidity
on
a
zoning
ordinance
which
seeks
to
draw
some
reasonable
line
based
on
the
average
family.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
we
would
risk
the
possibility
that
the
court
might
interpret
six
students
living
in
a
private
residence
as
not
being
a
fraternity
house.
this
seeks
to
duck
the
eye
and
cross
the
case,
so
to
speak.
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
the
primary
source
of
the
influx
into
belle
terre,
should
it
ever
happen,
i
anticipate
would
be
students,
but
the
ordinance,
itself,
covers
any,
as
i
say,
two
families
that
move
in
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
the
practical
source
of
unrelated
individuals
in
the
case
of
belle
terre
is
students,
but
the
ordinance
is
not
limited
to
students.
it’s
not
--
mr.
bernard
e.
gegan
exactly
so,
your
honor,
and
i
would
only
conclude
by
saying
that
zoning
has
traditionally
been
–
been
considered
a
matter
of
local
responsibility
and
this
court
has
wisely
refrained
from
becoming
a
national
board
of
standards
and
appeals
to
hear
applications
--
bearings
has
been
zoned.
i
thank
the
court.
