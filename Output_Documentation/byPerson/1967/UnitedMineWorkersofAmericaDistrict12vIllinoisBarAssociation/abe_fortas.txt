justice
abe
fortas
any
disciplinary
proceedings
been
brought
against
the
lawyer
himself?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
combs
is
the,
umw,
is
united
corporate
association,
is
it
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
i
suppose
your
theory
as
of
the
members
of
the
umw
that
the
miners
operating
through
this
united
corporate
association
in
fact
got
together
and
hired
a
lawyer
for
this
purpose.
justice
abe
fortas
now
does
the
umw
have
welfare
program.
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
amount
collected
by
the
individual
and
the
worker's
compensation
have
any
bearing
upon
the
umw
welfare
program.
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
tell
us
very
briefly
how
that
happens?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
union
has
as,
regarded
as
an
entity
has
an
interest
and
apart
of
from
its
benevolent
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
man
and
in
saying
that
they
prosecute
their
workmen's
compensation
claims.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
combs
does
umw
also
maintain
hospitals
in
some
areas?
justice
abe
fortas
does
it
provide
any
medical
services
at
all,
any
doctor
services
to
its
members?
justice
abe
fortas
and
how
does
they
do
that,
does
it
do
that
by
comparable
arrangement
or
is
it
short
list?
justice
abe
fortas
has
there
been
complaint
anywhere
from
medical
societies
comparable
to
the
complaint
that
has
been
made
here
by
the
bar
association
of
illinois?
justice
abe
fortas
there
has
been
no
litigation
then?
justice
abe
fortas
are
there
other
unions
that
have
arrangements
comparable
to
the
umw
arrangement
with
respect
to
attorneys
for
--
justice
abe
fortas
for
workmen
compensation.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
rare
or
is
it
fairly
prevalent?
justice
abe
fortas
now
i
wonder
precisely
what
your
point
is,
you
wouldn't
question
would
you,
at
this
date
that
the
union
had
the
right
to
recommend
a
particular
lawyer
to
its
members,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
not
asking
us
to
over
rule
railroad
trainmen.
justice
abe
fortas
alright
now
what
is
your
objection?
justice
abe
fortas
let
us
say
the
union
couldn't
have
referred
every
one
of
these
miner
to
mr.
trainer
or
whatever
his
name
was,
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
established
by
a
decision
in
railroad
trainmen
and
now
what
is
your
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
it
your
point
--
well
the
question
is
whether
it's
practice
of
law
--
certain
--
state
regulation
begins
that's
really
the
question,
no
question
about
the
state
power
to
regulate
the
practice
of
law.
but
does
the
record
here
show
that
the
union
attempted
to
or
did
in
fact
confront
the
legal
advice
or
the
methodology
used
by
mr.
trainer
in
giving
legal
advice.
justice
abe
fortas
i
am
afraid
you
are
not,
i
am
afraid
i
didn't
make
my
question
clear.
does
the
record
show
that
the
union
controlled
or
attempted
to
control
the
legal
advice
given
by
mr.
trainer
to
the
injured
mine
workers?
justice
abe
fortas
does
the
record
show
that
the
union
controlled
or
attempted
to
control
mr.
trainer's
methodology
as
procedure
in
handling
these
cases?
justice
abe
fortas
well
in
substance
what
you're
arguing
here
is
that
these
people
were
being
represented
not
by
the
lawyer
or
the
lawyers,
but
that
their
legal
work
was
if
anything
performed
by
a
lay
agency,
that's
your
point.
justice
abe
fortas
and
there
--
and
you
have
to
show
some
basis
for
that
argument
because
if
we
go
to
the
compensation
and
commission
records,
i
suppose
it
goes
that
john
(inaudible)
who
is
represented
by
mr.
trainer
or
whoever
is
a
qualified
lawyer.
now
then
you
have
to
show
us
if
there
are
in
this
record
factors
which
show
that
this
lawyer
was
not
--
was
merely
a
nominal
representative
of
these
people
and
that
the
real
representative
was
the
umw
and
thus
far
what
you've
told
us,
so
far
as
i
know
is
only
that
the
umw
paid
him
a
salary
and
that
he
did
not
collect
the
fee
from
the
individual
members,
is
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
that
that's
kind
of
(inaudible)
since
the
members
then
pay
them
–
they
then
control
them
since
the
mineworkers
paid
them
with
salary,
therefore
the
mine
workers
controlled
him
in
the
sense
that
the
mine
workers
were
really
the
representatives
of
people
who
appeared
to
be
his
clients.
is
there
anything
more
on
your
position
than
that?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
bertrand
can
you
distinguish
this
case
from
the
legal
assistance
program
or
the
poverty
office,
the
oeo.
that
is
to
say
as
i
understand
it
in
some
areas
there
are
lawyers
hired
as
--
on
funds
provided
by
the
poverty
program
and
they
represent
indigent
people
and
they
represent
them
not
only
before
agencies
of
the
government
but
before
courts.
now
on
the
basis
of
your
argument,
these
people
are
not
paid
by
the
clients,
they
are
paid
by
the
--
out
of
federal
funds
sometimes
in
some
states
out
of
state
funds.
now
is
it
your
representation
that
this
is
the
practice
of
the
law
by
the
united
states
government
and
not
by
the
people
representing
these
indigents?
justice
abe
fortas
what's
that
got
to
do
with
any
legal
front?
justice
abe
fortas
or
the
regulation
of
the
practice
of
the
law.
you
don't
make
a
distinction
between
illinois
law
regulating
practice
before
courts
and
agencies
as
whether
the
lawyer
is
representing
an
indigent
he
can
do
it,
he
can
be
paid
by
somebody
else
and
is
still
professionally
all
right
and
vice-versa.
justice
abe
fortas
oh
i'm
very
proud,
i'm
very
proud
of
the
fact
that
they
supported
it
enthusiastically.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that's
fundamentally
different
even
though
the
individual
minor
lost
an
arm
or
a
leg
they
could
still
--
different
from
the
oeo
situation
because
one
is
an
indigent
and
the
other
isn't?
justice
abe
fortas
what
if
he
lost
both
legs.
justice
abe
fortas
same
thing.
justice
abe
fortas
what
makes
a
person
indigent
and
subject
to
--?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
a
man
was
not
an
indigent
and
he
lost
both
legs
in
an
automobile
accident
and
he
then
became
indigent
and
he
went
to
the
oeo
for
help.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
case
and
the
man
who
in
an
industrial
accident
loses
both
legs?
justice
abe
fortas
so
did
the
fellow
who
lost
his
two
legs
in
an
automobile
accident.
justice
abe
fortas
okay
but
those
segments
are
not
in
this
case
but
there
are
some
things
that
are
relevant
i
think
that
are
now
and
how
do
you
dispose
off
the
legal
aid
bureaus
in
this
country
that
are
devoted
to
defending,
taking
care
of
people's
lives
in
civil
matters
as
well
as
criminal
matters?
now,
just
yesterday
i
happily
paid
my
contribution
to
a
group
of
lawyers
in
this
community
who
have
joined
together
for
the
purpose
of
representing
indigents
in
civil
manners.
now,
they
don't
pay
any
fees
and
they're
controlled
by
this
group
of
lawyers
who
employ
lawyers
to
represent
these
people
and
that's
done
all
over
the
united
states
where
bar
associations
are
really
forward-looking
and
are
trying
to
help
indigents.
justice
abe
fortas
any

the
