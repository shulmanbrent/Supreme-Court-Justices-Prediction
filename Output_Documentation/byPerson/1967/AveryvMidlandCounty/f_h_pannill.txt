mr.
f.
h.
pannill
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
consider
ourselves
remiss
and
our
duties
as
counsel
here,
if
we
failed
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
two
things,
the
causal
relationship
or
connection
between
them
being
for
the
court
to
determine.
one
is
that
in
the
way
the
american
system
of
government
is
structured.
there
is
a
special
relationship
between
the
states
and
a
county
such
as
midland
county
which
is
a
political
subdivision
of
and
a
creature
of
the
state
and
its
legislature
or
other
municipal
corporations.
the
other
is
that
the
united
states
constitution
is
applied
differently
to
local
governmental
subdivisions
and
municipal
corporations
than
to
individuals
or
private
corporations.
now,
i
make
those
two
statements
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
what
the
structure
of
the
united
states
government
is
and
as
to
what
this
court
in
past
opinions
has
held.
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
from
its
earliest
history
that
governmental
subdivisions
and
municipal
corporations
are
creatures
of
and
agents
of
the
state,
created
by
it
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
and
effectuating
its
law.
there
are
administrative
agencies
or
enforcement
agencies
they
have
been
created
by
the
states
for
that
purpose.
the
states
which
create
these
governmental
subdivisions
and
within
the
other
local
governmental
agencies
have
power
over
them
which
is
virtually
complete
and
except,
and
unless,
and
until
of
course,
such
power
is
exercised
in
a
way
as
to
run
counter
to
some
plainly
written
and
established
federal
constitutional
prohibitions.
specifically,
a
government
--
a
state
would
have
the
power
and
its
will
or
wish
or
whim
to
abolish
a
municipal
corporation
or
a
county,
or
to
divide
it
into
two
or
to
consolidate
and
merge
it.
but
certainly
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
a
state
could
not
exercise
that
power
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
its
creditors
high
and
dry
because
that
would
run
counter
to
and
bring
the
states
actually
in
conflict
with
the
contract
clause,
likewise
as
in
the
case
of
gomillion
versus
lightfoot,
which
is
cited
with
some
degree
of
relish
by
petitioner
in
this
brief.
admittedly,
a
state
may
not
exercise
this
control
which
it
has
over
its
municipal
corporations
and
its
governmental
subdivisions,
in
such
a
way
as
to
run
counter
two
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
bring
in
about
a
discrimination
in
voting
based
on
race.
but
subject
to
those
specific
constitutional
restraints,
the
states
have
plenary
power
over
their
municipal
corporation
and
likewise
over
the
officials
who
served
those
corporations.
there
are
decisions
which
we
have
cited
in
this
brief
to
the
effect
that
the
states
have
the
power
in
the
federal
system
to
provide
such
officers
and
officials
as
they
may
choose.
to
confer
on
these
officers
and
officials,
such
power
as
the
state
chooses
to
give
them
or
to
take
that
power
away
to
provide
that
they
may
be
selected
by
appointment
or
by
election,
or
by
combination
of
both.
or
the
states
have
power
to
abolish
these
officers
all
together.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
legislature
of
texas
structured
in
that
way
still
has
the
plenary
power
to
confer
on
and
take
from
its
political
subdivision
such
powers
with
these
governmental
functions
as
it
choses
to
confer
upon
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
--
say
no
sir,
that
there's
no
constitutional
danger.
it
might
take
it
away
in
such
a
way
as
they
run
counter
to
the
contract
clause
or
take
it
away
in
such
a
way
as
to
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
--
run
counter
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
but
the
decisions
which
have
been
cited
here
and
which
have
been
decided
by
this
court.
and
they
are
admittedly
decisions
of
sometime
in
the
past.but
they
haven't
particularly
the
case
of
hunter
against
pittsburgh
and
have
been
cited
by
this
case
as
recently
as
latest
term
in
its
consideration
of
the
sailors
case.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
it
does
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
their
powers,
sir,
are
knocked
out
conferred
entirely
by
the
constitution
of
the
state.
there
are
many
of
the
powers
and
functions
of
the
commissioners
court
which
are
conferred
by
the
statutes
enacted
by
the
legislature
and
for
all
anybody
has
developed
in
briefing
this
could
be
taken
away
at
will
by
the
legislature,
many
of
these
powers
in
function.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
powers
of
taxation?
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
legislature
would
have
the
power
to
supersede
the
county's
taxing
functions.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
to
--
it
certainly
has
a
power
to
limit
and
circumscribe
and
regulate
the
exercise
by
the
county
of
its
taxing
functions.
the
legislature
of
the
state
does
have
in
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
that
is
--
that
is
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
it
sounds
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
alright,
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
let
me
try
again
to
answer
in
this
way.
it
may
be
essentially
here
play
on
words
to
say
whether
or
not,
to
say
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
apply
or
that
it
does
apply
but
it
applies
in
a
way
which
is
so
different
from
its
application
to
state
governments
and
the
individuals
that
this
particular
case
or
the
particular
decision
and
action
of
the
state
of
texas
in
this
case
is
supported.
for
instance,
i
would
say
this,
this
court
has
established
many
times
and
as
recently
as
last
term
in
the
sailors
case
that
local
governmental
official
may
be
chosen
by
appointment
and
it
has
said
that
in
here
as
i
read
and
understand
that
opinion
that
that
power
of
appointment
of
the
state
of
michigan
can
be
delegated.
and
can
be
delegated
to
groups
or
voters
and
can
be
delegated
to
groups
or
voters
which
differ
from
each
other
markedly
and
materially
in
population,
in
numerical
context.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
no,
sir.
the
legislature
would
not
have
that
power
but
the
judicial
system
of
the
state
of
texas
does
have
that
power
and
has
exercised
that
in
this
case.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
sir,
when
i
answered
that
question,
i
thought
i
was
talking
about
the
powers
which
are
delegated
to
and
exercised
by
the
commissioners
court
and
not
the
existence
of
the
court.
if
i
have
here
stated
in
this
argument
that
the
legislature
of
texas
has
the
power
to
abolish
commissioners
court
then
it
was
entirely
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
it
is
not
disputed
by
me
of
all
people
that
the
legislature
of
texas
has
no
power
to
abolish
the
commissioners
court.
it
is
asserted
by
me
that
the
legislature
of
texas
has
a
plenary
authority
as
to
the
functions
which
shall
be
delegated
to
it
and
which
shall
be
exercised
by
it.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
it
says
four
precincts
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
that's
what
it
says
in
the
four
precincts
for
convenience
of
the
people
and
it
has
been
--
i
have
heard
it
argued
as
to
whether
they
could
overlapped
or
over
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
sir,
there
is
no
judicial
authority.
i've
heard
there's
the
point
argued
and
we
have
no
judicial
authority
on
it.
all
the
constitution
says
is
that
it
shall
be
divided
into
four
precincts
for
the
convenience
of
the
people.
it
does
not
specifically
say
that
these
precincts
cannot
overlap
or
conceivably
that
these
precincts
might
not
all
in
compose
exactly
the
same
territory
so
that
you
could
either
have
it
larger
than
that.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
i
think
it
would.
i
think
under
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
the
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
the
state
of
texas
is
free
to
adopt
it.
yes,
sir,
it
is.
and
that
part
of
the
texas
court's
opinion
in
which
it
mentioned
there
are
a
lot
of
possible
lost
of
the
voice
of
the
rural
residents
entirely,
if
equal
population
and
only
equal
population
were
applied.
was
if
i
mind
a
reference
to
or
a
suggestion
of
a
county
board
composed
as
your
honor,
suggests.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
oh,
yes.
and
the
state
provision
–
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
it
was
an
advantage,
your
honor,
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
equal
population
and
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
it.
i
mean
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
no.
no,
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
in
the
terms
of
this
case,
it
would
--
the
charge
or
complaint
would
have
to
be
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
its
opinion
failed
to
require
equal
population
amongst
the
commissioners
precincts
and
such
failure
constitutes
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
there
must
be
distilled
out
of
this
court's
reapportionment
cases.
if
there
is
an
effort
rather
on
the
part
of
petitioner
to
distill
out
of
this
court's
reapportionment
cases,
a
new
principle
of
constitutional
law
to
the
effect
that
any
time,
any
election
is
held
for
any
elected
official
to
serve
from
a
district,
his
district,
must
be
the
same
size
as
everybody
else's
state,
local,
or
what
not.
now
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
that's
right.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
the
decisions
so
held.
the
decisions
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
that
is
correct.
and
has
not
been
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
may
i
ask
--
may
i
suggest
sir?
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
sir,
may
i
answer
the
question
in
this
way.
as
i
read
this
court's
opinion
in
the
sailors
case,
it
permitted
the
selection
of
a
county
school
board
by
other
board
members
who
came
from
unequally
populated
district.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
as
i
understand
it
this
court's
opinion
and
decision
in
gray
against
sanders,
that
same
type
of
the
elective
process
would
not
be
permitted
by
this
court
as
to
the
governor
of
the
state.
that
is
my
reading
of
those
two
decisions
that
the
governor
of
the
state
could
not
be
chosen
by
delegates
selected
from
unequally
populated
districts
or
divisions
but
that
a
local
county
school
board
can
be
appointed
or
selected.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
it
was
officials
coming
from
or
selected
from
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
--
unequally
populated
districts.
and
that
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
stated
here
previously
and
that
is
that
under
these
decisions
as
i
read
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
differently
to
local
governmental
subdivisions.
now,
whether
you
say
it
applies
or
but
allows
a
more
latitude
and
allows
more
getting
of
greater
weight
in
consideration
to
such
factors
as
geography
and
roads
which
are
not
proper
factors
to
be
considered
in
a
legislative
district
in
case.
or
whether
you
say
that
it
just
doesn't
apply
to
the
elections
at
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
--
just
a
different
way
of
saying
the
same
thing.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
you
could
apply,
your
honor,
logically
and
rationally
in
this
way,
that
we
have
at
the
basis
of
our
entire
governmental
system,
the
doctrine
that
the
ultimate
sovereign
power
is
reposed
in
the
people.
and
that
each
person,
each
citizen,
exercises
certain
rights
of
sovereign
--
sovereignty
in
proper
times
and
in
proper
ways.
at
the
same
time,
the
same
citizen
is
a
subject
or
subject
to
the
laws
and
rules,
and
regulations
of
the
state
which
he
has
created
to
carry
out
his
sovereignty.
and
so
that
when
a
citizen
actually
in
a
dual
capacity,
he
is
sovereign
and
he
is
also
a
subject
and
that
when
he
votes,
he
very
well
may
vote
in
one
capacity
and
not
in
the
other.
and
that
when
--
and
in
the
voting
cases
which
this
court
has
considered
up
until
this
time,
concern
only
state
officials
who
exercise
the
inherent
sovereign
power
of
the
state.
and
that
when
a
citizen
is
acting
as
a
sovereign
and
voting
for
someone
who
is
a
state
official,
and
who
has
inherent
sovereign
power,
then
he
must
be
permitted
to
exercise
his
pro
rata
part
of
the
sovereign
power
and
if
he
is
not
permitted,
he
is
denied
equal
protection.
when
that
same
citizen
cast
a
vote
in
a
bond
election
or
a
school
board
election,
or
a
county
commissioners
court
election,
then
that
same
citizen
is
that
--
that
entity
is
not
a
sovereign.
and
as
to
that
entity,
he
is
not
exercising
his
sovereign
power.
he
is
choosing
an
official
which
could
well
be
chosen
in
some
other
ways.
he
is
merely
acting
as
a
good
citizen
and
selecting
an
official
who
is
to
perform
a
subordinate
and
inferior
function.
and
that
if
you
give
him
less
then
his
pro
rata
part
of
the
vote
there
you
have
not
entailed
his
exercise
of
his
basic
citizen
sovereign
power.
it
can
in
my
mind
be
rationalized
in
that
way.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
have
you
ever
applied
this
rule
of
the
so-called
rule
of
reynolds
versus
sims?
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
this
one
man,
one
vote
so-called
has
been
applied
at
anything
below
the
state
level.
am
i
answering
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
it
might
go
to
the
point
beyond
that,
mr.
justice
black
because
as
i
understand
this
argument
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
and
on
the
part
of
the
government,
they
admit
that
there
are
some
governmental
subdivisions
and
agencies
which
are
not
subject
to
this
so-called
one
man
one
vote
rule.
the
petitioner's
brief,
as
i
read
it,
against
the
jury
of
distinction
between
legislative
and
administrative
officials
or
districts,
or
powers,
and
attempts
to
establish
that
this
particular
one
is
exercising
legislative
power.
the
government
in
its
brief,
it
attempts
to
draw
it
at
some
kind
of
a
distinction
between
a
general
purpose
and
special
purpose
districts.
but
this
whole
case
has
been
submitted
to
this
court
on
the
agreement
as
i
comprehend
the
position
of
the
party,
it's
attached
to
the
agreement
that
there
is
a
point
in
local
government
to
which
this
so-called
one
man,
one
vote
rule
does
not
extend.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
as
i
understand
their
position,
it
does
not
extend
in
connection
with
the
legislative.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
the
government
draws
a
line
as
to
special
purpose
districts?
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
special
purpose
districts
such
as
water
conservation
districts
or
something
like
that
and
draws
the
line
to
the
effect
that
where
you
have
a
group
of
citizens
which
has
a
special
interest
or
is
particularly
affected
by
the
action
of
that
government,
then
considerations
other
than
population
would
be
predominant.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well
i
–-
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
something
of
that
nature,
i
think
they
probably
included
school
districts
in
there.
that
probably
would
be
the
most
in
numerous
type
of
district
that
there
is
with
this
court
last
term
had
a
school
district
when
you
had
taxing
power.
and
as
i
understand
it,
they
did
not
apply
the
decision
in
the
same
way
that
it
had
been
or
would
be
applied
on
a
state
level.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
i
would
say
that
the
argument
which
i
have
made
couldn't
be
made
to
sustain
and
unequally
apportion
council
in
that
type
of
government.
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
i
do
not
represent
that
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
is
made
to
depend
upon
on
this
argument
which
i
am
making.
we
are
here
resisting
the
relief
which
this
petitioner
seeks.
and
we
resisted
on
whatever
grounds
we
may
reasonably
argue.
if
this
court
in
its
wisdom
choses
to
draw
a
distinction
between
legislative
and
administrative
functions
or
districts,
then
we
would
say
that
we
are
exempt
or
immune,
if
you
please,
under
that
exception
or
distinction
because
we
do
not
have
a
legislative
district.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
your
honor.
to
be
candid
with
the
court,
the
argument
which
i
have
made
would
be
equally
applicable
to
that,
always
denying
that
that
is
our
case
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
--
or
decision
of
this
particular
kind.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
election
of
the
constables?
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well
–-
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
the
constables
in
with
which
i'm
familiar
are
elected
from
a
precinct,
a
single
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
--
precinct
and
heard
any
division
within
the
precinct.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
i
don't
understand
sir
that
that
they
could
ever
be
brought
in.
i
mean
the
citizen
and
voters
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
within
a
precinct,
the
constable
with
which
i'm
familiar
are
elected
by
all
of
the
voters
in
a
certain
precinct
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
you
would
just
have
the
parallel
of
this
county
commissioner
state
who
would
in
my
mind,
he
would
have
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
the
argument
which
i
have
made
would
support
that
from
the
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes
sir,
i
submit
that
the
cases
as
decided
have
been
divided
along
that
line
and
that
they
may
rationally
be
divided
along
that
line
for
the
reasons
which
i
here
suggest
and
present
to
the
court.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
here
as
to
a
policy
argument.
we
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
had
refrained
from
giving
any
policy
arguments
basing
off
–
base
on
the
type
of
--
or
the
amount
of
litigation
which
may
result
from
this.
we
have
kept
ourselves
above
that.
there
is
a
policy
argument
which
i
believe
applies
to
that
and
it
simply
is
this,
that
a
citizen's
right
to
participate
in
the
creation
or
making
of
the
law
is
not
the
same
as
his
right
to
participate
in
the
administration
of
the
law.
the
policy
which
i
suggest
and
argue
to
your
honors
on
--
in
this
particular
case
is
simply
one
which
would
ask
this
court
not
to,
at
the
request
of
individual
citizens,
insert
this
doctrine
into
administrative
functions
of
local
officials
contrary
to
a
state's
own
determination
as
to
their
distribution
and
the
distribution
of
their
powers,
and
the
manner
of
their
selection
where
there
has
been
no
showing
of
any
independently
existing
basic
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner
having
been
valid.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
consider
ourselves
remiss
and
our
duties
as
counsel
here,
if
we
failed
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
two
things,
the
causal
relationship
or
connection
between
them
being
for
the
court
to
determine.
one
is
that
in
the
way
the
american
system
of
government
is
structured.
there
is
a
special
relationship
between
the
states
and
a
county
such
as
midland
county
which
is
a
political
subdivision
of
and
a
creature
of
the
state
and
its
legislature
or
other
municipal
corporations.
the
other
is
that
the
united
states
constitution
is
applied
differently
to
local
governmental
subdivisions
and
municipal
corporations
than
to
individuals
or
private
corporations.
now,
i
make
those
two
statements
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
to
what
the
structure
of
the
united
states
government
is
and
as
to
what
this
court
in
past
opinions
has
held.
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
from
its
earliest
history
that
governmental
subdivisions
and
municipal
corporations
are
creatures
of
and
agents
of
the
state,
created
by
it
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
and
effectuating
its
law.
there
are
administrative
agencies
or
enforcement
agencies
they
have
been
created
by
the
states
for
that
purpose.
the
states
which
create
these
governmental
subdivisions
and
within
the
other
local
governmental
agencies
have
power
over
them
which
is
virtually
complete
and
except,
and
unless,
and
until
of
course,
such
power
is
exercised
in
a
way
as
to
run
counter
to
some
plainly
written
and
established
federal
constitutional
prohibitions.
specifically,
a
government
--
a
state
would
have
the
power
and
its
will
or
wish
or
whim
to
abolish
a
municipal
corporation
or
a
county,
or
to
divide
it
into
two
or
to
consolidate
and
merge
it.
but
certainly
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
a
state
could
not
exercise
that
power
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
its
creditors
high
and
dry
because
that
would
run
counter
to
and
bring
the
states
actually
in
conflict
with
the
contract
clause,
likewise
as
in
the
case
of
gomillion
versus
lightfoot,
which
is
cited
with
some
degree
of
relish
by
petitioner
in
this
brief.
admittedly,
a
state
may
not
exercise
this
control
which
it
has
over
its
municipal
corporations
and
its
governmental
subdivisions,
in
such
a
way
as
to
run
counter
two
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
bring
in
about
a
discrimination
in
voting
based
on
race.
but
subject
to
those
specific
constitutional
restraints,
the
states
have
plenary
power
over
their
municipal
corporation
and
likewise
over
the
officials
who
served
those
corporations.
there
are
decisions
which
we
have
cited
in
this
brief
to
the
effect
that
the
states
have
the
power
in
the
federal
system
to
provide
such
officers
and
officials
as
they
may
choose.
to
confer
on
these
officers
and
officials,
such
power
as
the
state
chooses
to
give
them
or
to
take
that
power
away
to
provide
that
they
may
be
selected
by
appointment
or
by
election,
or
by
combination
of
both.
or
the
states
have
power
to
abolish
these
officers
all
together.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
legislature
of
texas
structured
in
that
way
still
has
the
plenary
power
to
confer
on
and
take
from
its
political
subdivision
such
powers
with
these
governmental
functions
as
it
choses
to
confer
upon
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
--
say
no
sir,
that
there's
no
constitutional
danger.
it
might
take
it
away
in
such
a
way
as
they
run
counter
to
the
contract
clause
or
take
it
away
in
such
a
way
as
to
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
--
run
counter
to
the
fifteenth
amendment
but
the
decisions
which
have
been
cited
here
and
which
have
been
decided
by
this
court.
and
they
are
admittedly
decisions
of
sometime
in
the
past.but
they
haven't
particularly
the
case
of
hunter
against
pittsburgh
and
have
been
cited
by
this
case
as
recently
as
latest
term
in
its
consideration
of
the
sailors
case.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
it
does
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
their
powers,
sir,
are
knocked
out
conferred
entirely
by
the
constitution
of
the
state.
there
are
many
of
the
powers
and
functions
of
the
commissioners
court
which
are
conferred
by
the
statutes
enacted
by
the
legislature
and
for
all
anybody
has
developed
in
briefing
this
could
be
taken
away
at
will
by
the
legislature,
many
of
these
powers
in
function.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
powers
of
taxation?
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
the
legislature
would
have
the
power
to
supersede
the
county's
taxing
functions.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
to
--
it
certainly
has
a
power
to
limit
and
circumscribe
and
regulate
the
exercise
by
the
county
of
its
taxing
functions.
the
legislature
of
the
state
does
have
in
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
that
is
--
that
is
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
it
sounds
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
alright,
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
let
me
try
again
to
answer
in
this
way.
it
may
be
essentially
here
play
on
words
to
say
whether
or
not,
to
say
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
does
not
apply
or
that
it
does
apply
but
it
applies
in
a
way
which
is
so
different
from
its
application
to
state
governments
and
the
individuals
that
this
particular
case
or
the
particular
decision
and
action
of
the
state
of
texas
in
this
case
is
supported.
for
instance,
i
would
say
this,
this
court
has
established
many
times
and
as
recently
as
last
term
in
the
sailors
case
that
local
governmental
official
may
be
chosen
by
appointment
and
it
has
said
that
in
here
as
i
read
and
understand
that
opinion
that
that
power
of
appointment
of
the
state
of
michigan
can
be
delegated.
and
can
be
delegated
to
groups
or
voters
and
can
be
delegated
to
groups
or
voters
which
differ
from
each
other
markedly
and
materially
in
population,
in
numerical
context.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
no,
sir.
the
legislature
would
not
have
that
power
but
the
judicial
system
of
the
state
of
texas
does
have
that
power
and
has
exercised
that
in
this
case.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
sir,
when
i
answered
that
question,
i
thought
i
was
talking
about
the
powers
which
are
delegated
to
and
exercised
by
the
commissioners
court
and
not
the
existence
of
the
court.
if
i
have
here
stated
in
this
argument
that
the
legislature
of
texas
has
the
power
to
abolish
commissioners
court
then
it
was
entirely
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
it
is
not
disputed
by
me
of
all
people
that
the
legislature
of
texas
has
no
power
to
abolish
the
commissioners
court.
it
is
asserted
by
me
that
the
legislature
of
texas
has
a
plenary
authority
as
to
the
functions
which
shall
be
delegated
to
it
and
which
shall
be
exercised
by
it.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
it
says
four
precincts
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
that's
what
it
says
in
the
four
precincts
for
convenience
of
the
people
and
it
has
been
--
i
have
heard
it
argued
as
to
whether
they
could
overlapped
or
over
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
sir,
there
is
no
judicial
authority.
i've
heard
there's
the
point
argued
and
we
have
no
judicial
authority
on
it.
all
the
constitution
says
is
that
it
shall
be
divided
into
four
precincts
for
the
convenience
of
the
people.
it
does
not
specifically
say
that
these
precincts
cannot
overlap
or
conceivably
that
these
precincts
might
not
all
in
compose
exactly
the
same
territory
so
that
you
could
either
have
it
larger
than
that.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
i
think
it
would.
i
think
under
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
the
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
the
state
of
texas
is
free
to
adopt
it.
yes,
sir,
it
is.
and
that
part
of
the
texas
court's
opinion
in
which
it
mentioned
there
are
a
lot
of
possible
lost
of
the
voice
of
the
rural
residents
entirely,
if
equal
population
and
only
equal
population
were
applied.
was
if
i
mind
a
reference
to
or
a
suggestion
of
a
county
board
composed
as
your
honor,
suggests.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
oh,
yes.
and
the
state
provision
–
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
it
was
an
advantage,
your
honor,
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
equal
population
and
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
it.
i
mean
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
no.
no,
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
in
the
terms
of
this
case,
it
would
--
the
charge
or
complaint
would
have
to
be
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
in
its
opinion
failed
to
require
equal
population
amongst
the
commissioners
precincts
and
such
failure
constitutes
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
mr.
justice
black,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
there
must
be
distilled
out
of
this
court's
reapportionment
cases.
if
there
is
an
effort
rather
on
the
part
of
petitioner
to
distill
out
of
this
court's
reapportionment
cases,
a
new
principle
of
constitutional
law
to
the
effect
that
any
time,
any
election
is
held
for
any
elected
official
to
serve
from
a
district,
his
district,
must
be
the
same
size
as
everybody
else's
state,
local,
or
what
not.
now
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
that's
right.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
the
decisions
so
held.
the
decisions
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
that
is
correct.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
that
is
correct.
and
has
not
been
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
may
i
ask
--
may
i
suggest
sir?
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
sir,
may
i
answer
the
question
in
this
way.
as
i
read
this
court's
opinion
in
the
sailors
case,
it
permitted
the
selection
of
a
county
school
board
by
other
board
members
who
came
from
unequally
populated
district.
as
i
understand
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
as
i
understand
it
this
court's
opinion
and
decision
in
gray
against
sanders,
that
same
type
of
the
elective
process
would
not
be
permitted
by
this
court
as
to
the
governor
of
the
state.
that
is
my
reading
of
those
two
decisions
that
the
governor
of
the
state
could
not
be
chosen
by
delegates
selected
from
unequally
populated
districts
or
divisions
but
that
a
local
county
school
board
can
be
appointed
or
selected.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
it
was
officials
coming
from
or
selected
from
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
--
unequally
populated
districts.
and
that
leads
me
to
the
conclusion
stated
here
previously
and
that
is
that
under
these
decisions
as
i
read
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
differently
to
local
governmental
subdivisions.
now,
whether
you
say
it
applies
or
but
allows
a
more
latitude
and
allows
more
getting
of
greater
weight
in
consideration
to
such
factors
as
geography
and
roads
which
are
not
proper
factors
to
be
considered
in
a
legislative
district
in
case.
or
whether
you
say
that
it
just
doesn't
apply
to
the
elections
at
all,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
--
just
a
different
way
of
saying
the
same
thing.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
you
could
apply,
your
honor,
logically
and
rationally
in
this
way,
that
we
have
at
the
basis
of
our
entire
governmental
system,
the
doctrine
that
the
ultimate
sovereign
power
is
reposed
in
the
people.
and
that
each
person,
each
citizen,
exercises
certain
rights
of
sovereign
--
sovereignty
in
proper
times
and
in
proper
ways.
at
the
same
time,
the
same
citizen
is
a
subject
or
subject
to
the
laws
and
rules,
and
regulations
of
the
state
which
he
has
created
to
carry
out
his
sovereignty.
and
so
that
when
a
citizen
actually
in
a
dual
capacity,
he
is
sovereign
and
he
is
also
a
subject
and
that
when
he
votes,
he
very
well
may
vote
in
one
capacity
and
not
in
the
other.
and
that
when
--
and
in
the
voting
cases
which
this
court
has
considered
up
until
this
time,
concern
only
state
officials
who
exercise
the
inherent
sovereign
power
of
the
state.
and
that
when
a
citizen
is
acting
as
a
sovereign
and
voting
for
someone
who
is
a
state
official,
and
who
has
inherent
sovereign
power,
then
he
must
be
permitted
to
exercise
his
pro
rata
part
of
the
sovereign
power
and
if
he
is
not
permitted,
he
is
denied
equal
protection.
when
that
same
citizen
cast
a
vote
in
a
bond
election
or
a
school
board
election,
or
a
county
commissioners
court
election,
then
that
same
citizen
is
that
--
that
entity
is
not
a
sovereign.
and
as
to
that
entity,
he
is
not
exercising
his
sovereign
power.
he
is
choosing
an
official
which
could
well
be
chosen
in
some
other
ways.
he
is
merely
acting
as
a
good
citizen
and
selecting
an
official
who
is
to
perform
a
subordinate
and
inferior
function.
and
that
if
you
give
him
less
then
his
pro
rata
part
of
the
vote
there
you
have
not
entailed
his
exercise
of
his
basic
citizen
sovereign
power.
it
can
in
my
mind
be
rationalized
in
that
way.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
have
you
ever
applied
this
rule
of
the
so-called
rule
of
reynolds
versus
sims?
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
this
one
man,
one
vote
so-called
has
been
applied
at
anything
below
the
state
level.
am
i
answering
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
it
might
go
to
the
point
beyond
that,
mr.
justice
black
because
as
i
understand
this
argument
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
and
on
the
part
of
the
government,
they
admit
that
there
are
some
governmental
subdivisions
and
agencies
which
are
not
subject
to
this
so-called
one
man
one
vote
rule.
the
petitioner's
brief,
as
i
read
it,
against
the
jury
of
distinction
between
legislative
and
administrative
officials
or
districts,
or
powers,
and
attempts
to
establish
that
this
particular
one
is
exercising
legislative
power.
the
government
in
its
brief,
it
attempts
to
draw
it
at
some
kind
of
a
distinction
between
a
general
purpose
and
special
purpose
districts.
but
this
whole
case
has
been
submitted
to
this
court
on
the
agreement
as
i
comprehend
the
position
of
the
party,
it's
attached
to
the
agreement
that
there
is
a
point
in
local
government
to
which
this
so-called
one
man,
one
vote
rule
does
not
extend.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
sir.
as
i
understand
their
position,
it
does
not
extend
in
connection
with
the
legislative.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
the
government
draws
a
line
as
to
special
purpose
districts?
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
special
purpose
districts
such
as
water
conservation
districts
or
something
like
that
and
draws
the
line
to
the
effect
that
where
you
have
a
group
of
citizens
which
has
a
special
interest
or
is
particularly
affected
by
the
action
of
that
government,
then
considerations
other
than
population
would
be
predominant.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well
i
–-
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
something
of
that
nature,
i
think
they
probably
included
school
districts
in
there.
that
probably
would
be
the
most
in
numerous
type
of
district
that
there
is
with
this
court
last
term
had
a
school
district
when
you
had
taxing
power.
and
as
i
understand
it,
they
did
not
apply
the
decision
in
the
same
way
that
it
had
been
or
would
be
applied
on
a
state
level.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
i
would
say
that
the
argument
which
i
have
made
couldn't
be
made
to
sustain
and
unequally
apportion
council
in
that
type
of
government.
i
would
hasten
to
add
that
i
do
not
represent
that
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
is
made
to
depend
upon
on
this
argument
which
i
am
making.
we
are
here
resisting
the
relief
which
this
petitioner
seeks.
and
we
resisted
on
whatever
grounds
we
may
reasonably
argue.
if
this
court
in
its
wisdom
choses
to
draw
a
distinction
between
legislative
and
administrative
functions
or
districts,
then
we
would
say
that
we
are
exempt
or
immune,
if
you
please,
under
that
exception
or
distinction
because
we
do
not
have
a
legislative
district.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes,
your
honor.
to
be
candid
with
the
court,
the
argument
which
i
have
made
would
be
equally
applicable
to
that,
always
denying
that
that
is
our
case
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
--
or
decision
of
this
particular
kind.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
election
of
the
constables?
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well
–-
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
the
constables
in
with
which
i'm
familiar
are
elected
from
a
precinct,
a
single
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
--
precinct
and
heard
any
division
within
the
precinct.
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
i
don't
understand
sir
that
that
they
could
ever
be
brought
in.
i
mean
the
citizen
and
voters
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
within
a
precinct,
the
constable
with
which
i'm
familiar
are
elected
by
all
of
the
voters
in
a
certain
precinct
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
well,
you
would
just
have
the
parallel
of
this
county
commissioner
state
who
would
in
my
mind,
he
would
have
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
the
argument
which
i
have
made
would
support
that
from
the
--
mr.
f.
h.
pannill
yes
sir,
i
submit
that
the
cases
as
decided
have
been
divided
along
that
line
and
that
they
may
rationally
be
divided
along
that
line
for
the
reasons
which
i
here
suggest
and
present
to
the
court.
there
has
been
a
suggestion
here
as
to
a
policy
argument.
we
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
had
refrained
from
giving
any
policy
arguments
basing
off
–
base
on
the
type
of
--
or
the
amount
of
litigation
which
may
result
from
this.
we
have
kept
ourselves
above
that.
there
is
a
policy
argument
which
i
believe
applies
to
that
and
it
simply
is
this,
that
a
citizen's
right
to
participate
in
the
creation
or
making
of
the
law
is
not
the
same
as
his
right
to
participate
in
the
administration
of
the
law.
the
policy
which
i
suggest
and
argue
to
your
honors
on
--
in
this
particular
case
is
simply
one
which
would
ask
this
court
not
to,
at
the
request
of
individual
citizens,
insert
this
doctrine
into
administrative
functions
of
local
officials
contrary
to
a
state's
own
determination
as
to
their
distribution
and
the
distribution
of
their
powers,
and
the
manner
of
their
selection
where
there
has
been
no
showing
of
any
independently
existing
basic
constitutional
rights
of
the
petitioner
having
been
valid.
thank
you,
your
honor.
