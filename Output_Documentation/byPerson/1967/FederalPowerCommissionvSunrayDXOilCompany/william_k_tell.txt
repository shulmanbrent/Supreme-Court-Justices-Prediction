mr.
william
k.
tell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
william
tell.
i'm
counsel
for
texaco.
i
am
appearing
this
morning
on
behalf
of
the
12
producer
respondents
who
have
filed
a
joint
brief
in
number
60,
61,
62,
number
80
and
97.
we
are
respondents
from
the
appeal
taken
from
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
at
a
case
which
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
amerada
case,
sometimes
the
sunray
case.
the
lead
docket
was
amerada
and
the
proceedings
before
the
commission;
it
was
sunray
and
the
tenth
circuit
that's
the
reason
for
the
varying
nomenclature.
i
will
be
followed
by
four
other
producer
counsels.
my
presentation
will
be
directed
solely
to
the
question
of
the
appropriate
in-line
price
for
texas
district
4,
for
the
period
subsequent
to
the
issuance
of
the
commission
statement
of
general
policy
in
september
1960.
mr.
william
k.
tell
yes,
that
is
my
brief,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
johnson
following
me
will
appear
on
behalf
of
certain
producers
who
are
parties
in
the
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
decisions
in
sinclair
and
hawkins.
he
will
be
followed
by
mr.
killbourne
who
is
presenting
an
individual
argument
on
behalf
of
the
superior
oil
company
with
respect
to
the
appeal
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
decision
in
sinclair
and
hawkins.
following
mr.
killbourne
will
be
mr.
caskin,
who
is
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
same
12
producer
respondents
that
i
am
from
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
in
amerada
and
sunray.
mr.
caskin
will
discuss
the
question
of
refunds
under
the
temporary
certificates.
that
issue
appears
only
in
the
tenth
circuit
decision.
it
is
not
present
in
the
district
of
columbia
opinion
in
sinclair
and
hawkins.
following
mr.
caskin
will
be
mr.
justin
wolf
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
standard
oil
company
of
texas.
mr.
wolf
will
also
direct
himself
to
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
commission's
ordering
of
retroactive
refunds
under
the
unconditioned
temporary
certificates
that
were
issued
in
district
4.
if
i
may,
i
will
turn
at
this
time
to
the
question
of
the
initial
price
in
the
amerada
or
sunray
cases.
as
previous
counsel
have
pointed
out
to
you
the
doctrine
of
in-line
pricing
had
it's
genesis
in
this
court's
catco
decision
rendered
in
1959.
at
that
time
the
court
was
faced
with
a
situation
particularly
on
the
southern
louisiana
area
but
not
necessarily
confined
thereto
where
as
a
result
of
the
rapid
growth
and
demand
for
natural
gas,
there
had
been
an
increase
in
the
field
price
of
that
product.
as
it
rose
from
a
waste
product
to
a
product
that
had
premium
value
and
became
an
equal
partner
with
crude
oil
in
the
end
markets.
during
the
period
subsequent
to
the
phillips
decision
in
1954
when
the
commission
was
told
it
had
jurisdiction
over
independent
producer
rates,
there
was,
as
a
result
of
this
accelerated
growth
and
demand
for
natural
gas,
an
increase
in
fuel
price
levels.
the
commission
at
that
time
faced
with
a
difficult
problem
of
attempting
to
determine
and
develop
standards
for
the
regulation
of
independent
producers.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
was
not
able
with
the
limited
staff
that
it
had
to
pay
as
much
scrutiny,
as
this
court
felt
was
required
to
the
initial
prices
that
it
was
certificating
under
section
7.
the
commission's
position
at
that
time
was
that
it
would
do
the
best
job
it
could
in
section
7
proceedings
but
would
hold
until
the
section
5
rate
investigations,
the
final
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rate.
in
catco,
this
court
directed
the
commission
to
give
more
scrutiny
to
the
initial
price
lines.
and
it
remanded
a
commission
decision
which
had
certificated
new
producer
sales
in
southern
louisiana
that
had
established
a
new
price
plateau.
i
submit
that
upon
reading
the
court's
decision
in
catco,
the
vice
which
the
commission
--
which
the
court
found
in
the
commission's
decision
was
the
failure
to
make
fundings
upon
the
record
in
that
case
that
justified
the
reason
why
it
was
in
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
approve
a
new,
and
at
that
time,
the
highest
price
plateau
that
had
been
proposed
for
that
particular
pricing
area,
southern
louisiana.
the
court
in
its
opinion
instructed
the
commission
to
hold
the
line.
it
did
not
attempt
to
spell
out
any
précised
formula
as
to
what
techniques
should
be
used
to
hold
the
line,
what
was
meant
by
the
line,
how
the
line
should
be
found.
within
the
context
of
the
court's
opinion
in
catco,
it
would
appear
that
the
reference
to
the
line
was
a
reference
to
the
existing
level
of
contract
prices
in
the
field
at
that
time.
on
remand
in
catco,
the
commission
attempted
to
implement
this
court's
directive
to
hold
the
line.
and
it
developed
a
methodology
which
has
subsequently
been
referred
to
as
in-liners
or
in-line
pricing.
this
court
first
had
before
it,
a
review
of
the
commission's
in-line
methodology
in
the
callery
case.
unfortunately,
the
producer
respondents
in
callery,
did
not
fully
briefed
the
question
of
the
commission's
in-line
methodology
because
the
fifth
circuit
had
held
that
the
commission
had
erred
in
confining
its
consideration
to
in-line
evidence,
and
that
broader
evidence
representations
were
required.
although
the
court's
majority
opinion
did
approve
the
commission's
20-cent
in-line
price
established
in
callery,
47
louisiana.
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
clearly
recognized
that
the
in-line
methodology
had
not
been
fully
developed
in
callery,
and
suggested
that
the
matter
would
not
be
foreclosed
for
further
consideration
in
subsequent
cases.
now,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
commission
in
its
review
of
the
price
line
in
texas
railroad
district
4
for
the
period
after
september
28th,
1960,
the
date
on
which
it
issued
its
statement
of
initial
policy,
concluded
that
changed
circumstances
and
current
conditions
required
an
increase
in
its
original
in-line
price
established
for
a
period
in
the
1950s
from
15
to
16
cents.
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
in
evaluating
whether
or
not
the
commission
may
have
erred
in
concluding
the
changed
circumstances
required
an
increase
in
the
price
line.
to
recognize
that
when
these
proceedings
were
started
in
1961
and
'62,
that
it
was
apparent
that
there
would
be
a
period
of
a
substantial
number
of
years
before
we
would
have
just
and
reasonable
rates
finally
established
in
the
texas
gulf
coast.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
that
prognosis
has
been
shown
to
be
correct
by
the
passage
of
time.
we
do
not
as
of
this
date
even
have
the
examiners
decision
recommending
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
the
texas
gulf
coast,
although
the
hearings
have
been
completed.
and
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
anticipate
that
at
least
an
examiner's
decision
would
be
rendered
shortly,
possibly
a
commission's
decision
within
a
year
or
year-and-a-half
from
now.
but
it's
certainly
fair
to
say
that
the
in-line
price
established
by
the
commission
in
the
sunray
and
amerada
proceeding
was
the
price
for
the
decade
of
the
1960s
in
the
texas
gulf
coast.
that
was
the
price
that
was
going
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
interstate
pipeline
purchasers
would
be
able
to
effectively
compete
for
new
gas
supplies
from
the
texas
gulf
coast.
it
was
well
known
to
the
commission
the
evidence
that
had
been
brought
to
its
attention
in
many
proceedings
that
the
texas
gulf
coast
is
one
of
the
most
rapidly
expanding
industrial
markets
in
the
country.
that
it
is
a
giant
consumer
of
intrastate
gas
for
the
petrol
chemical
complexes
and
other
industrial
components
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area.
in
1958,
approximately
two
thirds
of
the
new
sales
made
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
were
two
interstate
pipeline
purchasers.
by
1961,
that
volume
had
dropped
to
only
50%.
and
today
it
is
far
below
that
figure.
we
have
been
faced
with
a
situation
in
the
texas
gulf
coast,
for
a
number
of
years
where
the
new
purchasers
by
the
interstate
pipelines
has
been
less
than
their
withdrawals.
in
other
words,
they
are
liquidating
their
present
committed
reserve
inventory
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area.
these
were
the
circumstances
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
the
interstate
pipeline.
mr.
william
k.
tell
no
sir.
the
interstate
pipelines
have
been
unable
to
acquire
new
reserved
editions
equal
to
their
withdrawals
in
the
texas
gulf
coast.
they
are
liquidating
their
inventory
of
committed
reserves.
we
submit
that
under
those
circumstances
it
was
clearly
appropriate
for
the
commission
not
to
feel
placed
in
a
straitjacket
and
bound
to
perpetuate
a
15-cent
in-line
price
that
it
had
found
for
the
1950's
and
project
that
into
the
decade
of
the
1960's.
catco
just
clearly
cannot
be
read
to
say
that
the
commission
as
a
matter
of
law
was
required
to
hold
the
line
for
an
indefinite
period
into
the
future
regardless
of
any
changes
in
circumstances
that
might
come
to
the
commission's
attention.
since
catco,
the
various
circuits
and
the
commission
itself
has
recognized,
that
in
applying
the
in-line
standard,
consideration
must
be
given
to
current
conditions
in
the
industry
and
changed
circumstances.
now,
within
the
context
of
this
case,
what
were
those
changed
circumstances,
what
evidence
do
the
commission
look
to,
to
justify
its
judgment,
that
change
circumstances
required
an
increase
in
its
1950's
price
line?
the
producers,
when
this
hearing
was
first
set,
came
forward
with
evidentiary
presentation
that
was
400
pages
in
length
including
exhibits.
we
were
conscious
of
the
problems
that
this
court
had
recognized
and
directed
the
commission
to
adopt
more
streamline
procedures
to
move
these
producer
cases
along.
our
evidentiary
presentation
here
was
not
that
the
individual
company
cost
of
service
presentation
that
so
dominated
the
producer
evidence
that
was
presented
in
callery.
there
may
have
been
one
or
two
producers
who
proffered
individual
company
cost
to
service
evidence.
but
the
main
producer
group
came
forward
with
what
we
considered
to
be
a
streamline
evidentiary
presentation
that
would
show
to
this
commission
graphically
what
were
these
changed
circumstances.
all
of
the
evidence
was
excluded
on
motion
by
the
distributors
and
the
commission
staff.
they
claimed
it
was
irrelevant.
we
have
pending
in
this
court
a
conditional
cross
petition
in
number
82
which
has
not
been
acted
upon,
which
request
this
court
to
grant
certiorari.
in
the
event
it
concludes
that
the
evidence
that
commission
did
use
to
justify
its
increase
in
price
from
15
to
16
cents
was
inadequate
and
not
substantial.
what
the
distributors
have
done
is
put
the
commission
in
a
complete
vice.
they
have
successfully
obtained
the
exclusion
of
all
of
the
generalized
cost
trend
and
economic
evidence,
supply
and
demand
consideration
evidence
that
the
producer
has
brought
forward.
they
have
confined
the
evidence
of
record
to
a
limited
area.
and
now
they
claim
that
the
commission's
reliance
upon
the
remaining
evidence
was
inadequate
that
it
--
the
evidence
that's
left
wasn't
substantial
enough
to
support
their
result.
there
go
less
perpetuate
the
price
freeze
at
15
cents.
now,
the
commission
attempted
to
respond
to
the
difficult
position
that
it
was
placed
in.
it
wanted
to
move
these
cases
as
long
as
quickly
as
it
could.
therefore,
it
rounded
the
distributor
motions,
excluded
the
producer
presentations,
and
relied
rather
instead
upon
a
price
exhibit
that
was
submitted
by
its
staff
which
did
show
the
trends
in
contracting
patterns
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
during
the
period
from
1955
to
1962.
it
also
looked
to
its
initial
price
levels
that
had
been
approved
under
temporary
certificates
and
gave
consideration
to
the
price
levels
which
it
had
established
in
a
statement
of
general
policy,
which
was
the
product
of
commission
expertise
and
based
upon
six
or
seven
years
of
experience
in
handling
producer
matters
since
1954.
it
concluded
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence
that
there
definitely
had
been
change
circumstances
in
the
market.
and
that
an
increase
in
the
price
from
15
to
16
cents
was
clearly
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
now,
we
submit
that
what
the
commission
has
done
was
proper
and
lawful.
that
although
it
may
have
been
more
desirable
to
make
a
more
detailed
analysis
into
these
underlying
economic
trends
and
changed
circumstances
which
were
shown
by
the
evidence
that
we
proffered,
that
nevertheless
certainly
a
general
feeling
for
the
industry
problems
and
developments
could
be
found
from
the
type
of
evidence
which
did
remain
in
the
record
in
which
the
commission
utilized.
we
do
say,
however,
that
if
you
are
unwilling
to
accept
the
quality
of
the
evidence
which
the
commission
utilized
in
this
proceeding
in
supporting
its
initial
price
determination,
then
you
cannot
leave
this
agency
in
the
type
of
straitjacket
that
is
inherent
from
the
distributor
position.
but
you
must
then,
we
respectfully
submit,
grant
our
conditional
cross
petition
in
number
82
and
permit
the
commission
to
enlarge
the
record
to
receive
the
more
detailed
evidence
which
we
proffered
which
clearly
would
have
supported
and
justified
the
pricing
decisions
which
the
commission
reached
in
this
case.
i
would
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
yes
mr.
justice
white,
the
commission
started
in
area
rate
proceeding
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
in
1963.
the
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
the
hearing
has
been
concluded.
briefs
have
been
filed
before
the
presiding
examiner.
he
has
not
yet
rendered
his
initial
decision.
we
expect
it
very
shortly.
mr.
william
k.
tell
16
cents.
mr.
william
k.
tell
mr.
justice
white
we,
first
of
all,
do
not
contest
that
there
would
be
refunds
due
for
amounts
that
have
been
collected
after
1964
under
the
court's
stay
or
commission's
stay,
i
should
say.
we're
talking
here
about
a
prospective
period.
mr.
william
k.
tell
the
commission's
rate
investigations
under
section
4
or
5
deal
prospectively.
there
would
not
be
retroactive
adjustments.
i
might
say,
however,
that
one
can
only
speculate
as
to
whether
or
not
the
final
just
and
reasonable
rate
will
be
greater
or
lesser
than
the
in-line
price.
we
know
in
the
permian
basin
area,
that
the
new
gas
rate
was
higher
than
the
policy
statement
guideline.
mr.
william
k.
tell
they
did
above
a
level
of
18
cents.
they
found
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
it
would
take
a
price
higher
than
18
cents
to
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
the
general
pricing
structure
in
the
area.
mr.
william
k.
tell
there
could
have
been
an
alternative
approach,
mr.
justice
white,
but
let
me
show
you
why
that
was
not
an
adequate
remedy.
we
are
accepting
the
16-cent
determination
although
before
the
commission
on
the
lower
court,
we
contended
that
it
should
have
been
higher.
but
certainly
we
say
that
the
record
of
evidence
was
adequate
to
support
16
cents.
mr.
william
k.
tell
we
could
prospectively
but
since
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
--
1964
we
have
been
making
deliveries
under
the
commission's
permanent
certificates
at
16
cents.
we
couldn't
have
made
filings
from
15
to
16
cents
between
1964
and
1968.
that
would
have
been
exercising
redundancy
because
we
already
had
a
filed
rated
of
16
cents.
and
yet
if
you
hold
for
the
distributors
now
and
say
it
should
be
15
cents
before
the
mechanism
is
an
adequate
protection,
there's
no
way
we
could
retroactively
recoup
the
difference
for
the
past
four
years.
it's
just
--
it's
just
not
an
adequate
mechanism.
i
think
it
might
also
be
significant
to
note
that
the
commission
staff
rate
recommendations
in
the
area
rate
proceeding
for
this
area.
and
in
the
permian
basin
the
commission
staff
rate
recommendations
were
substantially
lower
than
what
the
commission
itself
approved.
the
commission
staff
recommendations,
for
70%
of
the
gas
that
is
involved
in
these
two
consolidated
cases
would
be
between
16-4
and
16-8,
a
level
higher
than
the
in-line
price
which
the
commission
has
established.
mr.
william
k.
tell
we
could've
file
from
16
to
18.
mr.
william
k.
tell
we
could
have,
mr.
justice
white.
our
position
is
that
where
we
have
had
so
much
uncertainty
that
where
we're
willing
to
accept
the
16
cents.
we're
not
seeking
levels
higher
than
16
cents.
we're
willing
to
stand
on
the
commission's
order.
we
certainly
could
have
filed
for
more
under
section
4
(e).
our
concern
is,
how
are
we
going
to
keep
the
penny
between
15
and
16
cents?
the
commission
gave
it
to
us.
if
it's
remanded
now
and
later
found
to
be
something
more,
we
could
never
get
it
back.
there's
no
retroactive
mechanism
for
that.
mr.
william
k.
tell
basically,
there
are
three
issues
in
the
consolidated
cases
before
you.
there
are
two
raised
in
our
brief.
one
is
the
appropriate
initial
price.
second
is
--
15.
the
second
is
whether
or
not
there
should
be
retroactive
refunds
under
the
unconditioned
temporary
certificate.
the
third
issue
is
not
present
in
my
case.
it
is
present
in
the
d.c.
circuit
opinion
and
that
is
the
need
issue
that
mr.
simons
addressed
himself
to.
mr.
william
k.
tell
those
are
the
three
issues
before
the
court
today.
yes,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
that's
correct.
now,
mr.
justice
black,
we
are
here
before
the
court
aligned
with
the
commission
on
the
initial
price
issue.
mr.
william
k.
tell
on
the
refund
issue,
the
commission
in
its
february
5th
order
originally
held
for
the
producers.
it
later
reversed
itself.
and
today
i
regret
to
say
the
commission
is
aligned
with
the
“seaboard
interest”
on
the
refund
issue.
the
commission
is
also
aligned
with
us
on
the
need
question.
we
are
aligned
with
the
commission
on
two
of
the
three
issues
before
the
court
this
morning.
mr.
william
k.
tell
yes.
mr.
william
k.
tell
use
of
the
temporary
certificates,
its
policy
statement
guideline
levels
and
then
an
examination
of
trends
in
the
field
prices,
in
the
railroad
district
during
the
relevant
time
period.
i
want
to
also
say
that
i
think
it's
important
in
terms
of
evaluating
what
should
be
done
on
the
initial
price
issue
that
as
the
commission
solicitor
told
you
yesterday,
the
period
of
in-line
pricing
is
pretty
much
water
over
the
dam.
we're
hopeful
that
there
will
be
just
and
reasonable
rates
established
within
the
next
year
or
so.
there
are
no
important
policy
questions
here
for
the
future.
a
remand
of
these
cases
on
the
initial
price
issue
to
start
all
over
again,
one
of
texaco
sales
the
gas
reserves
are
already
depleted,
the
wells
has
been
--
have
been
plugged
and
abandoned.
i'm
sure
that
in
the
case
of
most
of
these
producer
sales
the
reserves
are
pretty
close
to
being
half
depleted.
if
we
have
to
go
back
and
start
all
over
again
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
set
prices
for
what
is
basically
a
lot
in
period
in
the
past,
i
submit
that
that
will
not
be
a
utilization
of
the
commission's
resources
that
would
be
most
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
the
commission
and
its
staff
and
i
think
the
industry
would
hope
that
we
could
get
these
just
and
reasonable
rates
established
and
in
effect,
and
have
a
workable
system
of
regulation
that
would
permit
us
all
to
get
on
about
our
business.
and
going
back
and
reopening
and
attempting
to
readjust
these
past
retroactive
periods,
six
or
eight
years
ago
adjusting
rates
generating
refunds
that
whether
they
will
ever
reach
the
people
that
paid
the
rate
differences
back
in
'60
or
'61
is
highly
problematical.
it
just
does
not
seem
to
be
a
satisfactory
approach
to
the
problem.
mr.
william
k.
tell
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
by
permanent
rate
you
mean
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
the
area
proceeding?
mr.
william
k.
tell
no,
that
is
not
in
the
present
record
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
k.
tell
i
don't
believe
that
it
would.
these
cases
come
before
you
as
certificate
cases
under
section
7
and
the
permanent
rates,
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
are
in
the
rate
cases
under
section
4
and
5.
there,
the
commission
has
agreed
to
receive
and
review
entirely
different
types
of
evidence
in
these
rate
cases.
mr.
william
k.
tell
under
section
5,
the
rate
cases,
that
would
be
correct.
under
section
7
we
have
different
statutory
language.
it
may
mean
the
same
thing.
what
is
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
rate
is
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
in
the
certificate
procedures.
mr.
william
k.
tell
well,
i
think
you
have
to
--
we
have
an
area
rates
that
would
be
one
of
the
important
questions
that
someday
this
court
will
have
to
resolve.
in
new
section
7
proceedings
that
have
been
initiated
after
we
have
an
area
rate
established,
is
the
area
rate
automatically
the
section
7
rate
or
will
there
be
perhaps
opportunities
for
the
commission
to
consider
whether
a
change
circumstances
may
require
some
revisions
there.
mr.
william
k.
tell
no,
and
it
might
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
and
i
hope
that
i
didn't
mislead
mr.
justice
black
because
i
think
there
definitely
is
a
distinction
in
statutory
standard
that
may
lead
to
two
different
results.
mr.
william
k.
tell
i
didn't
intend
to.
mr.
william
k.
tell
well,
let's
hope
the
commission
set
rates
that
everybody's
happy
with
it
and
that
won't
be
necessary.
mr.
william
k.
tell
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
william
tell.
i'm
counsel
for
texaco.
i
am
appearing
this
morning
on
behalf
of
the
12
producer
respondents
who
have
filed
a
joint
brief
in
number
60,
61,
62,
number
80
and
97.
we
are
respondents
from
the
appeal
taken
from
the
tenth
circuit's
decision
at
a
case
which
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
amerada
case,
sometimes
the
sunray
case.
the
lead
docket
was
amerada
and
the
proceedings
before
the
commission;
it
was
sunray
and
the
tenth
circuit
that's
the
reason
for
the
varying
nomenclature.
i
will
be
followed
by
four
other
producer
counsels.
my
presentation
will
be
directed
solely
to
the
question
of
the
appropriate
in-line
price
for
texas
district
4,
for
the
period
subsequent
to
the
issuance
of
the
commission
statement
of
general
policy
in
september
1960.
mr.
william
k.
tell
yes,
that
is
my
brief,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
johnson
following
me
will
appear
on
behalf
of
certain
producers
who
are
parties
in
the
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
decisions
in
sinclair
and
hawkins.
he
will
be
followed
by
mr.
killbourne
who
is
presenting
an
individual
argument
on
behalf
of
the
superior
oil
company
with
respect
to
the
appeal
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
decision
in
sinclair
and
hawkins.
following
mr.
killbourne
will
be
mr.
caskin,
who
is
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
same
12
producer
respondents
that
i
am
from
the
tenth
circuit's
opinion
in
amerada
and
sunray.
mr.
caskin
will
discuss
the
question
of
refunds
under
the
temporary
certificates.
that
issue
appears
only
in
the
tenth
circuit
decision.
it
is
not
present
in
the
district
of
columbia
opinion
in
sinclair
and
hawkins.
following
mr.
caskin
will
be
mr.
justin
wolf
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
standard
oil
company
of
texas.
mr.
wolf
will
also
direct
himself
to
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
commission's
ordering
of
retroactive
refunds
under
the
unconditioned
temporary
certificates
that
were
issued
in
district
4.
if
i
may,
i
will
turn
at
this
time
to
the
question
of
the
initial
price
in
the
amerada
or
sunray
cases.
as
previous
counsel
have
pointed
out
to
you
the
doctrine
of
in-line
pricing
had
it's
genesis
in
this
court's
catco
decision
rendered
in
1959.
at
that
time
the
court
was
faced
with
a
situation
particularly
on
the
southern
louisiana
area
but
not
necessarily
confined
thereto
where
as
a
result
of
the
rapid
growth
and
demand
for
natural
gas,
there
had
been
an
increase
in
the
field
price
of
that
product.
as
it
rose
from
a
waste
product
to
a
product
that
had
premium
value
and
became
an
equal
partner
with
crude
oil
in
the
end
markets.
during
the
period
subsequent
to
the
phillips
decision
in
1954
when
the
commission
was
told
it
had
jurisdiction
over
independent
producer
rates,
there
was,
as
a
result
of
this
accelerated
growth
and
demand
for
natural
gas,
an
increase
in
fuel
price
levels.
the
commission
at
that
time
faced
with
a
difficult
problem
of
attempting
to
determine
and
develop
standards
for
the
regulation
of
independent
producers.
as
a
practical
matter,
it
was
not
able
with
the
limited
staff
that
it
had
to
pay
as
much
scrutiny,
as
this
court
felt
was
required
to
the
initial
prices
that
it
was
certificating
under
section
7.
the
commission's
position
at
that
time
was
that
it
would
do
the
best
job
it
could
in
section
7
proceedings
but
would
hold
until
the
section
5
rate
investigations,
the
final
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rate.
in
catco,
this
court
directed
the
commission
to
give
more
scrutiny
to
the
initial
price
lines.
and
it
remanded
a
commission
decision
which
had
certificated
new
producer
sales
in
southern
louisiana
that
had
established
a
new
price
plateau.
i
submit
that
upon
reading
the
court's
decision
in
catco,
the
vice
which
the
commission
--
which
the
court
found
in
the
commission's
decision
was
the
failure
to
make
fundings
upon
the
record
in
that
case
that
justified
the
reason
why
it
was
in
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
approve
a
new,
and
at
that
time,
the
highest
price
plateau
that
had
been
proposed
for
that
particular
pricing
area,
southern
louisiana.
the
court
in
its
opinion
instructed
the
commission
to
hold
the
line.
it
did
not
attempt
to
spell
out
any
précised
formula
as
to
what
techniques
should
be
used
to
hold
the
line,
what
was
meant
by
the
line,
how
the
line
should
be
found.
within
the
context
of
the
court's
opinion
in
catco,
it
would
appear
that
the
reference
to
the
line
was
a
reference
to
the
existing
level
of
contract
prices
in
the
field
at
that
time.
on
remand
in
catco,
the
commission
attempted
to
implement
this
court's
directive
to
hold
the
line.
and
it
developed
a
methodology
which
has
subsequently
been
referred
to
as
in-liners
or
in-line
pricing.
this
court
first
had
before
it,
a
review
of
the
commission's
in-line
methodology
in
the
callery
case.
unfortunately,
the
producer
respondents
in
callery,
did
not
fully
briefed
the
question
of
the
commission's
in-line
methodology
because
the
fifth
circuit
had
held
that
the
commission
had
erred
in
confining
its
consideration
to
in-line
evidence,
and
that
broader
evidence
representations
were
required.
although
the
court's
majority
opinion
did
approve
the
commission's
20-cent
in-line
price
established
in
callery,
47
louisiana.
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
clearly
recognized
that
the
in-line
methodology
had
not
been
fully
developed
in
callery,
and
suggested
that
the
matter
would
not
be
foreclosed
for
further
consideration
in
subsequent
cases.
now,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
commission
in
its
review
of
the
price
line
in
texas
railroad
district
4
for
the
period
after
september
28th,
1960,
the
date
on
which
it
issued
its
statement
of
initial
policy,
concluded
that
changed
circumstances
and
current
conditions
required
an
increase
in
its
original
in-line
price
established
for
a
period
in
the
1950s
from
15
to
16
cents.
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
in
evaluating
whether
or
not
the
commission
may
have
erred
in
concluding
the
changed
circumstances
required
an
increase
in
the
price
line.
to
recognize
that
when
these
proceedings
were
started
in
1961
and
'62,
that
it
was
apparent
that
there
would
be
a
period
of
a
substantial
number
of
years
before
we
would
have
just
and
reasonable
rates
finally
established
in
the
texas
gulf
coast.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
that
prognosis
has
been
shown
to
be
correct
by
the
passage
of
time.
we
do
not
as
of
this
date
even
have
the
examiners
decision
recommending
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
the
texas
gulf
coast,
although
the
hearings
have
been
completed.
and
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
anticipate
that
at
least
an
examiner's
decision
would
be
rendered
shortly,
possibly
a
commission's
decision
within
a
year
or
year-and-a-half
from
now.
but
it's
certainly
fair
to
say
that
the
in-line
price
established
by
the
commission
in
the
sunray
and
amerada
proceeding
was
the
price
for
the
decade
of
the
1960s
in
the
texas
gulf
coast.
that
was
the
price
that
was
going
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
interstate
pipeline
purchasers
would
be
able
to
effectively
compete
for
new
gas
supplies
from
the
texas
gulf
coast.
it
was
well
known
to
the
commission
the
evidence
that
had
been
brought
to
its
attention
in
many
proceedings
that
the
texas
gulf
coast
is
one
of
the
most
rapidly
expanding
industrial
markets
in
the
country.
that
it
is
a
giant
consumer
of
intrastate
gas
for
the
petrol
chemical
complexes
and
other
industrial
components
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area.
in
1958,
approximately
two
thirds
of
the
new
sales
made
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
were
two
interstate
pipeline
purchasers.
by
1961,
that
volume
had
dropped
to
only
50%.
and
today
it
is
far
below
that
figure.
we
have
been
faced
with
a
situation
in
the
texas
gulf
coast,
for
a
number
of
years
where
the
new
purchasers
by
the
interstate
pipelines
has
been
less
than
their
withdrawals.
in
other
words,
they
are
liquidating
their
present
committed
reserve
inventory
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area.
these
were
the
circumstances
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
the
interstate
pipeline.
mr.
william
k.
tell
no
sir.
the
interstate
pipelines
have
been
unable
to
acquire
new
reserved
editions
equal
to
their
withdrawals
in
the
texas
gulf
coast.
they
are
liquidating
their
inventory
of
committed
reserves.
we
submit
that
under
those
circumstances
it
was
clearly
appropriate
for
the
commission
not
to
feel
placed
in
a
straitjacket
and
bound
to
perpetuate
a
15-cent
in-line
price
that
it
had
found
for
the
1950's
and
project
that
into
the
decade
of
the
1960's.
catco
just
clearly
cannot
be
read
to
say
that
the
commission
as
a
matter
of
law
was
required
to
hold
the
line
for
an
indefinite
period
into
the
future
regardless
of
any
changes
in
circumstances
that
might
come
to
the
commission's
attention.
since
catco,
the
various
circuits
and
the
commission
itself
has
recognized,
that
in
applying
the
in-line
standard,
consideration
must
be
given
to
current
conditions
in
the
industry
and
changed
circumstances.
now,
within
the
context
of
this
case,
what
were
those
changed
circumstances,
what
evidence
do
the
commission
look
to,
to
justify
its
judgment,
that
change
circumstances
required
an
increase
in
its
1950's
price
line?
the
producers,
when
this
hearing
was
first
set,
came
forward
with
evidentiary
presentation
that
was
400
pages
in
length
including
exhibits.
we
were
conscious
of
the
problems
that
this
court
had
recognized
and
directed
the
commission
to
adopt
more
streamline
procedures
to
move
these
producer
cases
along.
our
evidentiary
presentation
here
was
not
that
the
individual
company
cost
of
service
presentation
that
so
dominated
the
producer
evidence
that
was
presented
in
callery.
there
may
have
been
one
or
two
producers
who
proffered
individual
company
cost
to
service
evidence.
but
the
main
producer
group
came
forward
with
what
we
considered
to
be
a
streamline
evidentiary
presentation
that
would
show
to
this
commission
graphically
what
were
these
changed
circumstances.
all
of
the
evidence
was
excluded
on
motion
by
the
distributors
and
the
commission
staff.
they
claimed
it
was
irrelevant.
we
have
pending
in
this
court
a
conditional
cross
petition
in
number
82
which
has
not
been
acted
upon,
which
request
this
court
to
grant
certiorari.
in
the
event
it
concludes
that
the
evidence
that
commission
did
use
to
justify
its
increase
in
price
from
15
to
16
cents
was
inadequate
and
not
substantial.
what
the
distributors
have
done
is
put
the
commission
in
a
complete
vice.
they
have
successfully
obtained
the
exclusion
of
all
of
the
generalized
cost
trend
and
economic
evidence,
supply
and
demand
consideration
evidence
that
the
producer
has
brought
forward.
they
have
confined
the
evidence
of
record
to
a
limited
area.
and
now
they
claim
that
the
commission's
reliance
upon
the
remaining
evidence
was
inadequate
that
it
--
the
evidence
that's
left
wasn't
substantial
enough
to
support
their
result.
there
go
less
perpetuate
the
price
freeze
at
15
cents.
now,
the
commission
attempted
to
respond
to
the
difficult
position
that
it
was
placed
in.
it
wanted
to
move
these
cases
as
long
as
quickly
as
it
could.
therefore,
it
rounded
the
distributor
motions,
excluded
the
producer
presentations,
and
relied
rather
instead
upon
a
price
exhibit
that
was
submitted
by
its
staff
which
did
show
the
trends
in
contracting
patterns
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
during
the
period
from
1955
to
1962.
it
also
looked
to
its
initial
price
levels
that
had
been
approved
under
temporary
certificates
and
gave
consideration
to
the
price
levels
which
it
had
established
in
a
statement
of
general
policy,
which
was
the
product
of
commission
expertise
and
based
upon
six
or
seven
years
of
experience
in
handling
producer
matters
since
1954.
it
concluded
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence
that
there
definitely
had
been
change
circumstances
in
the
market.
and
that
an
increase
in
the
price
from
15
to
16
cents
was
clearly
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
now,
we
submit
that
what
the
commission
has
done
was
proper
and
lawful.
that
although
it
may
have
been
more
desirable
to
make
a
more
detailed
analysis
into
these
underlying
economic
trends
and
changed
circumstances
which
were
shown
by
the
evidence
that
we
proffered,
that
nevertheless
certainly
a
general
feeling
for
the
industry
problems
and
developments
could
be
found
from
the
type
of
evidence
which
did
remain
in
the
record
in
which
the
commission
utilized.
we
do
say,
however,
that
if
you
are
unwilling
to
accept
the
quality
of
the
evidence
which
the
commission
utilized
in
this
proceeding
in
supporting
its
initial
price
determination,
then
you
cannot
leave
this
agency
in
the
type
of
straitjacket
that
is
inherent
from
the
distributor
position.
but
you
must
then,
we
respectfully
submit,
grant
our
conditional
cross
petition
in
number
82
and
permit
the
commission
to
enlarge
the
record
to
receive
the
more
detailed
evidence
which
we
proffered
which
clearly
would
have
supported
and
justified
the
pricing
decisions
which
the
commission
reached
in
this
case.
i
would
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
yes
mr.
justice
white,
the
commission
started
in
area
rate
proceeding
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
in
1963.
the
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
the
hearing
has
been
concluded.
briefs
have
been
filed
before
the
presiding
examiner.
he
has
not
yet
rendered
his
initial
decision.
we
expect
it
very
shortly.
mr.
william
k.
tell
16
cents.
mr.
william
k.
tell
mr.
justice
white
we,
first
of
all,
do
not
contest
that
there
would
be
refunds
due
for
amounts
that
have
been
collected
after
1964
under
the
court's
stay
or
commission's
stay,
i
should
say.
we're
talking
here
about
a
prospective
period.
mr.
william
k.
tell
the
commission's
rate
investigations
under
section
4
or
5
deal
prospectively.
there
would
not
be
retroactive
adjustments.
i
might
say,
however,
that
one
can
only
speculate
as
to
whether
or
not
the
final
just
and
reasonable
rate
will
be
greater
or
lesser
than
the
in-line
price.
we
know
in
the
permian
basin
area,
that
the
new
gas
rate
was
higher
than
the
policy
statement
guideline.
mr.
william
k.
tell
they
did
above
a
level
of
18
cents.
they
found
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
it
would
take
a
price
higher
than
18
cents
to
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
the
general
pricing
structure
in
the
area.
mr.
william
k.
tell
there
could
have
been
an
alternative
approach,
mr.
justice
white,
but
let
me
show
you
why
that
was
not
an
adequate
remedy.
we
are
accepting
the
16-cent
determination
although
before
the
commission
on
the
lower
court,
we
contended
that
it
should
have
been
higher.
but
certainly
we
say
that
the
record
of
evidence
was
adequate
to
support
16
cents.
mr.
william
k.
tell
we
could
prospectively
but
since
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
--
1964
we
have
been
making
deliveries
under
the
commission's
permanent
certificates
at
16
cents.
we
couldn't
have
made
filings
from
15
to
16
cents
between
1964
and
1968.
that
would
have
been
exercising
redundancy
because
we
already
had
a
filed
rated
of
16
cents.
and
yet
if
you
hold
for
the
distributors
now
and
say
it
should
be
15
cents
before
the
mechanism
is
an
adequate
protection,
there's
no
way
we
could
retroactively
recoup
the
difference
for
the
past
four
years.
it's
just
--
it's
just
not
an
adequate
mechanism.
i
think
it
might
also
be
significant
to
note
that
the
commission
staff
rate
recommendations
in
the
area
rate
proceeding
for
this
area.
and
in
the
permian
basin
the
commission
staff
rate
recommendations
were
substantially
lower
than
what
the
commission
itself
approved.
the
commission
staff
recommendations,
for
70%
of
the
gas
that
is
involved
in
these
two
consolidated
cases
would
be
between
16-4
and
16-8,
a
level
higher
than
the
in-line
price
which
the
commission
has
established.
mr.
william
k.
tell
we
could've
file
from
16
to
18.
mr.
william
k.
tell
we
could
have,
mr.
justice
white.
our
position
is
that
where
we
have
had
so
much
uncertainty
that
where
we're
willing
to
accept
the
16
cents.
we're
not
seeking
levels
higher
than
16
cents.
we're
willing
to
stand
on
the
commission's
order.
we
certainly
could
have
filed
for
more
under
section
4
(e).
our
concern
is,
how
are
we
going
to
keep
the
penny
between
15
and
16
cents?
the
commission
gave
it
to
us.
if
it's
remanded
now
and
later
found
to
be
something
more,
we
could
never
get
it
back.
there's
no
retroactive
mechanism
for
that.
mr.
william
k.
tell
basically,
there
are
three
issues
in
the
consolidated
cases
before
you.
there
are
two
raised
in
our
brief.
one
is
the
appropriate
initial
price.
second
is
--
15.
the
second
is
whether
or
not
there
should
be
retroactive
refunds
under
the
unconditioned
temporary
certificate.
the
third
issue
is
not
present
in
my
case.
it
is
present
in
the
d.c.
circuit
opinion
and
that
is
the
need
issue
that
mr.
simons
addressed
himself
to.
mr.
william
k.
tell
those
are
the
three
issues
before
the
court
today.
yes,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
that's
correct.
now,
mr.
justice
black,
we
are
here
before
the
court
aligned
with
the
commission
on
the
initial
price
issue.
mr.
william
k.
tell
on
the
refund
issue,
the
commission
in
its
february
5th
order
originally
held
for
the
producers.
it
later
reversed
itself.
and
today
i
regret
to
say
the
commission
is
aligned
with
the
“seaboard
interest”
on
the
refund
issue.
the
commission
is
also
aligned
with
us
on
the
need
question.
we
are
aligned
with
the
commission
on
two
of
the
three
issues
before
the
court
this
morning.
mr.
william
k.
tell
yes.
mr.
william
k.
tell
use
of
the
temporary
certificates,
its
policy
statement
guideline
levels
and
then
an
examination
of
trends
in
the
field
prices,
in
the
railroad
district
during
the
relevant
time
period.
i
want
to
also
say
that
i
think
it's
important
in
terms
of
evaluating
what
should
be
done
on
the
initial
price
issue
that
as
the
commission
solicitor
told
you
yesterday,
the
period
of
in-line
pricing
is
pretty
much
water
over
the
dam.
we're
hopeful
that
there
will
be
just
and
reasonable
rates
established
within
the
next
year
or
so.
there
are
no
important
policy
questions
here
for
the
future.
a
remand
of
these
cases
on
the
initial
price
issue
to
start
all
over
again,
one
of
texaco
sales
the
gas
reserves
are
already
depleted,
the
wells
has
been
--
have
been
plugged
and
abandoned.
i'm
sure
that
in
the
case
of
most
of
these
producer
sales
the
reserves
are
pretty
close
to
being
half
depleted.
if
we
have
to
go
back
and
start
all
over
again
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
set
prices
for
what
is
basically
a
lot
in
period
in
the
past,
i
submit
that
that
will
not
be
a
utilization
of
the
commission's
resources
that
would
be
most
consistent
with
the
public
interest.
the
commission
and
its
staff
and
i
think
the
industry
would
hope
that
we
could
get
these
just
and
reasonable
rates
established
and
in
effect,
and
have
a
workable
system
of
regulation
that
would
permit
us
all
to
get
on
about
our
business.
and
going
back
and
reopening
and
attempting
to
readjust
these
past
retroactive
periods,
six
or
eight
years
ago
adjusting
rates
generating
refunds
that
whether
they
will
ever
reach
the
people
that
paid
the
rate
differences
back
in
'60
or
'61
is
highly
problematical.
it
just
does
not
seem
to
be
a
satisfactory
approach
to
the
problem.
mr.
william
k.
tell
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
by
permanent
rate
you
mean
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
the
area
proceeding?
mr.
william
k.
tell
no,
that
is
not
in
the
present
record
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
k.
tell
i
don't
believe
that
it
would.
these
cases
come
before
you
as
certificate
cases
under
section
7
and
the
permanent
rates,
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
are
in
the
rate
cases
under
section
4
and
5.
there,
the
commission
has
agreed
to
receive
and
review
entirely
different
types
of
evidence
in
these
rate
cases.
mr.
william
k.
tell
under
section
5,
the
rate
cases,
that
would
be
correct.
under
section
7
we
have
different
statutory
language.
it
may
mean
the
same
thing.
what
is
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
rate
is
the
issue
that's
before
the
court
in
the
certificate
procedures.
mr.
william
k.
tell
well,
i
think
you
have
to
--
we
have
an
area
rates
that
would
be
one
of
the
important
questions
that
someday
this
court
will
have
to
resolve.
in
new
section
7
proceedings
that
have
been
initiated
after
we
have
an
area
rate
established,
is
the
area
rate
automatically
the
section
7
rate
or
will
there
be
perhaps
opportunities
for
the
commission
to
consider
whether
a
change
circumstances
may
require
some
revisions
there.
mr.
william
k.
tell
no,
and
it
might
--
mr.
william
k.
tell
and
i
hope
that
i
didn't
mislead
mr.
justice
black
because
i
think
there
definitely
is
a
distinction
in
statutory
standard
that
may
lead
to
two
different
results.
mr.
william
k.
tell
i
didn't
intend
to.
mr.
william
k.
tell
well,
let's
hope
the
commission
set
rates
that
everybody's
happy
with
it
and
that
won't
be
necessary.
