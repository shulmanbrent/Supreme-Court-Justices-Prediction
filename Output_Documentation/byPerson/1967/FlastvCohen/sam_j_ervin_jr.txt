mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
judge
sutherland
might
well
have
stopped
in
the
frothingham
case
with
his
holding
that
the
plaintiff
attempted
to
attack
the
economic
interest
and
our
economic
interest
was
so
indeterminate
and
immeasurable
as
he
could
not
invoke
the
preventive
powers
of
court
of
equity.
he
didn't
stop
there
however
and
he
made
other
remarks
which
have
been
--
which
stated
in
substance
that
a
plaintiff
does
not
have
standing
to
attack
an
act
of
congress,
unless
he
can
establish
that
he
has
been
injured
directly
and
not
merely
in
some
indefinite
way
uncommon
with
people
generally.
now,
as
we
noted
that
the
frothingham
case
does
not
say
that
a
plaintiff
will
not
be
barred
from
prosecuting
his
suit
merely
because
his
injury
is
held
in
common
with
others.
if
the
plaintiff
injures
or
if
this
reasonably
direct
to
defer.
the
first
amendment
insofar
as
the
statute
was
concerned
was
based
in
the
constitution
tot
make
effective
the
decoration
of
the
thomas
jefferson
statute
for
religious
freedom
in
to
--
in
virginia
that
it
compelled
them
make
contributions
of
money
for
the
dissemination
of
religious
opinion.
he
does
believe
is
more
simple
and
ironic.
by
adding
that
into
the
first
amendment,
the
establishment
clause,
they
all
go
make
[indiscernible]
and
simple
but
also
unconstitutional.
i
maintain
that
a
first
amendment
case
is
different
from
a
case
generally
that
an
appropriation
on
expenditure
or
the
violation
on
the
first
amendment
of
the
entire
--
on
entirely
different
footing
from
an
appropriation
or
disbursement
authorized
by
an
act
of
congress
didn't
list,
but
the
case
in
the
frothingham
case.
i
respectfully
submit
that
on
a
fair
analysis
of
the
frothingham
case
that
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
case
at
bar.
the
--
under
the
first
amendment,
every
american
has
the
constitutional
rights
not
to
be
taxed
or
to
have
his
tax
money
expended
for
the
establishment
of
religion
in
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
this
is
the
--
not
some
remote
indefinite
right
but
it
is
a
--
it
is
the
direct
interest.
it
is
something
in
which
he
has
a
personal
to
stake
just
as
a
plaintiff
in
baker
and
carr
had
a
personal
state
in
not
having
his
vote
diluted.
so
you
have
in
this
case,
taxpayers,
citizens
taxpayers.
you
have
them
with
a
specific
--
right
under
the
first
amendment
not
to
be
taxed
or
to
have
that
tax
money
expended
in
violation
of
the
amendment.
in
addition
to
that
you
have
them
as
--
in
the
capacity
as
taxpayers
or
alleging
that
federal
funds,
federal
tax
moneys
to
which
they
have
contributed
as
taxpayers
about
to
be
used
by
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare
and
the
commission
of
education
to
establish
religion
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
it
is
absolutely
essential,
unless
we're
going
to
amend
the
–
for
all
intents
and
practical
purposes,
if
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
or
federal
courts
does
not
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
this
claim,
it
will
for
all
practical
intents
and
purposes
make
a
dead
parchment
out
of
a
part
of
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
because
effect
of
the
--
or
lack
of
judicial
review
in
claims
of
this
kind
would
be
to
say
that
congress
shall
pass
no
laws
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
provided
that
congress
may
pass
laws
appropriating
and
authorizing
the
disbursement
of
tax
moneys
to
establish
religion.
this
is
in
the
--
this
first
amendment
provision
--
of
this
--
as
late
mr.
justice
jackson
so
well
said
on
one
occasion
was
placed
first
in
the
bill
of
rights
because
it
was
first
in
the
minds
and
the
hearts
of
those
who
drafted
and
ratified
the
bill
of
rights.
and
this
court
--
other
decisions
of
this
court,
there
is
a
way
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
every
denial,
of
any
right
created
by
the
bill
of
rights
with
the
exception
of
these
rights
under
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment,
if
the
position
of
the
government
prevails
in
this
case.
mr.
pfeffer,
pointed
them
out
a
moment
ago,
the
great
decision
in
which
this
court
declared
that
the
right
of
americans
to
enjoy
the
rights
vouchsafed
to
them
by
the
democrats
does
not
depend
upon
any
election,
does
not
depend
on
any
vote.
but
these
are
rights
which
are
particularly
within
the
guardianship
of
this
court
and
certainly,
in
cases
like
baker
against
carr
where
this
court
said
that
a
man
had
a
personal
stake
and
he
had
an
concrete
adverse
position
to
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
case,
was
the
case
in
which
the
federal
courts
had
jurisdiction.
that's
the
situation.
here,
all
these
taxpayers,
these
citizens
who
have
a
constitutional
right
under
the
first
amendment
are
to
be
taxed
or
to
have
their
taxes
extended
for
the
establishment
of
religion
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
that's
a
direct
interest.
that's
a
serious
personal
stake.
and
every
american
citizen,
who
has
a
personal
stake
in
seeing
that
the
independence
of
government
from
religion
and
the
independence
of
religion
from
the
government
observed
and
when
the
congress
give
--
our
executive
branch
of
the
government,
even
in
a
violation
of
the
act
of
congress
on
the
take
--
to
take
federal
tax
moneys
and
they
have
them
expended
to
establish
religion
in
violation
to
the
first
amendment
then
a
justiciable
controversy
rises
because
of
the
interpretation
of
the
first
amendment
is
necessary,
the
decision
of
the
controversy
and
those
who
have
such
a
serious
--
in
such
a
direct,
in
such
a
personal
stake
in
maintaining
the
separation
of
church
and
state
as
decreed
by
the
first
amendment
have
standing
to
sue
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
and
that
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes.
in
that
case
the
plaintiff,
two
plaintiffs,
one
of
whom
had
a
child
in
the
school
and
both
of
whom
were
taxpayers.
they
brought
a
suit,
to
test
of
the
validity
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
new
jersey
statute
which
provided
for
the
reading
of
three
or
four
verses
from
the
bible
--
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
[indiscernible]
independence
of
the
action,
the
child
of
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
finished
his
school
and
was
not
in
school
at
the
time
the
suit
was
tried
and
of
course
as
far
as
--
the
jurisdiction
was
based
upon
the
claim
of
the
parent
that
was
the
establishment
of
religion
or
denial
free
exercise
which
was
concerned
became
moot.
the
court
held
was
held
as
far
as
the
taxpayers
were
concerned
that
they
did
not
allege
as
do
the
taxpayers
in
this
case
that
the
reading
of
these
--
three
or
four
verses
of
the
bible
entailed
any
increased
outlay
of
money.
so
there
was
no
question
of
expenditure
of
tax
bonds
involved
in
the
doremus
case.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
yes.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
no
taxes.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
they
didn't
allege
that
any
increase
in
taxes
had
been
occasioned
by
the
reading
of
this
three
or
four
verses
from
the
bible.
it
is
defied
up
--
here
because
a
great
expenditure
of
tax
money
was
involved.
so
that's
the
reason
that
doremus
case
has
no
application
here
and
i
say
that
when
you
take
the
fact
that
you
have
these
people,
who
have
a
direct,
who
have
an
interest
and
a
personal
stake
in
maintaining
the
separation
of
church
and
state
and
in
not
having
therefore
--
their
tax
moneys
used
to
establish
religion
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
it
is
in
my
mind
the
clear
case
of
standing
in
these
plaintiffs
to
sue.
mr.
sam
j.
ervin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
judge
sutherland
might
well
have
stopped
in
the
frothingham

he

that's

the

two

mr.

it

it
is
in
my
mind
the
clear

standing
