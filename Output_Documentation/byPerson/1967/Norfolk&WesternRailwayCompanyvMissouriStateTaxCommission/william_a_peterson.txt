mr.
william
a.
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please.
mr.
allen's
statement
of
the
issue
here
i
agree
with.
the
issue
precisely
before
the
court
we
feel
is
whether
or
not
the
1965
ad
valorem
tax
is
grossly
excessive.
the
only
part
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
is
grossly
excessive
and
if
it
is
grossly
excessive
within
the
standard
of
the
case
that
attribute
constitutional
problems
to
this
then
undoubtedly
it
would
be
or
could
be
a
burden
under
state
commerce
and
or
violates
a
due
process
clause
as
it
applies
to
the
states.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
if
i
understand
you
correctly
--
your
question
correctly
sir,
it
would
be
whether
or
not
i
suppose
the
tax
is
reasonably
related
to
the
commerce
conducted
in
the
state,
do
i
understand
you?
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
oh
not
at
all.
not
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
well
this
is
--
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
this
is
of
course
the
appellant's
contention
that
it
is.
and
the
state
tax
commission
is
taking
the
position
consistently
and
has
been
sustained
by
the
circuit
court
of
cole
county
on
judicial
review
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
that
it
is
not
and
the
point
that
we
would
like
to
raise
today
is
that
there
is
complete
authority
both
in
the
laws
as
handed
down
by
this
court
and
the
laws
of
the
state
of
missouri
for
the
tax.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
an
arbitrary
tax,
unsupported
by
findings
or
hearings
at
all.
the
--
and
i
would
like
to
reiterate
the
facts
just
briefly
here,
not
trying
to
fall
with
mr.
allen's.
assessments
by
the
missouri
tax
commission
are
made
based
on
information
submitted
by
the
railroad
companies
for
doing
business
in
the
state
of
missouri.
it
is
at
this
time,
if
they
disagree
with
the
assessment
that
a
hearing
is
held
pursuant
to
missouri
law.
it
was
at
this
time
a
hearing
was
held
in
this
particular
care
and
the
evidence,
purported
evidence
which
mr.
allen
has
discussed
was
submitted
to
the
commission.
now
the
commission
did
hear
that
evidence.
the
commission
did
make
a
finding
which
is
incorporated
in
the
appendix
to
the
record.
at
that
time
based
on
the
contentions
there
raised
and
these
contentions
as
well
as
others
were
raised.
the
circuit
court
of
cole
county
in
judicial
review
did
examine
this
and
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
did
examine.
now
the
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
examined
the
findings.
yes
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
on
page
55
in
the
appendix
to
the
record
i
believe.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
starting
on
52,
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
52,
page
52.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes
it
is
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
not
at
all.
in
fact
the
--
if
i
may
just
enlarge
an
answer.
supreme
court
of
missouri
in
southwest
railroad
versus
missouri
tax
commission
i
believe
in
1959,
1956
fully
adhered
to
the
cases
handed
down
in
this
court,
johnson
ore
refining
case,
the
union
tank
co.
disscussed
the
entire
line
of
cases
and
the
reasoning
was
not
that
the
missouri
does
have
a
power
by
virtue
of
its
laws
to
tax
property
located
in
other
states.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
certainly.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
this
is
what
they're
contending
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
we
do
not
feel
they
are.
mr.
allen
has
stressed
that
the
theory
upon
which
the
missouri
supreme
court
ultimately
sustained
the
missouri
tax
commission
was
the
theory
of
enhanced
value.
now
the
theory
of
enhanced
value
certainly
doesn't
knew
those
been
constantly
confirmed
by
this
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
don't
know
that
it's
ever
been
rejected.
now
the
theory
of
enhance
value
or
augmented
value
is
precisely
what
this
case
was
sustained
on
in
the
missouri
supreme
court
not
the
fact
that
missouri
had
to
power
to
tax
three
times
the
amount
of
the
traffic
in
the
state,
of
the
rolling
stock
in
the
state.
that's
not
the
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
if
i
may
sir,
the
formula
of
course
is
the
trackage
percentage
not
--
it's
not
proportion
number
of
cars.
it's
the
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes
total
depreciated
equal
less.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
mr.
justice
white,
that
is
correct
if
you
assume
that
that
has
happened.
but
we
know
from
the
teachings
of
this
court
that
if
it
is
a
grossly
excessive
amount
that
it
cannot
stand,
therefore,
it
is
a
rule
of
thumb
formula.
it
is
not
precise
and
it
has
been
acknowledged
that
it
cannot
be
précised
and
this
is
an
area
in
which
precision
is
virtually
impossible.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
say
that
there
are
evidence
in
the
commission
hearing
evidence
that
was
true.
somewhat
greater
number
but
not
any
large
number.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
may
i
answer
this
way,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
missouri
law
sets
down
the
formula,
i
mean
sets
down
how
the
commission
will
reach
a
total
valuation
figure.
now
on
rolling
stock,
the
way
the
commission
reaches
its
valuation
is
to
depreciate
and
equalize
the
entire
rolling
stock
so
in
that
respect,
in
answer
to
your
question
well
it
would
be
yes,
that
there
would
be
a
larger
valuation.
well
we
have
one
more
thing
to
do.
first
of
all,
we
apply
the
equalization
factor
which
45,
47%
then
we
apply
the
track
formula.
so
the
chances
of
getting
a
larger
figure
would
depend
on
the
total
of
depreciated
figure
that
we
began
with
and
unless
that
figure
was
obviously
excessive,
it
would
be
applied.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
mr.
justice
fortas
the
missouri
tax
commission
in
its
findings
explains
the
equalization
factor.
that's
also
on
page
52,
through
55
or
56
but
the
point
is
to
equalize
the
tax
on
the
property
fairly
consistently
with
taxes
on
property
throughout
the
state.
the
commission
explains
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
this
--
that
percentage
figure
is
not
mr.
justice
brennan
but
it's
an
attempt
by
the
tax
commission
to
make
it
assessed.
to
just
talk
in
terms
47%
would
not
be
the
whole
story.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
and
it
is
set
out
in
their
finding,
how
they
arrived
with
that.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes
mr.
justice
fortas
and
that
also
in
their
finding.
47%
is
applied
to
all
railroads.
the
depreciation
and
equalization
schedules
are
applied
straight
across
the
board.
as
was
an
economic
factor
in
this
case
of
an
excess
$300,000.00
which
is
in
appreciation
of
any
other
financial
things
that
haven't
been
covered,
this
is
also
authorized
by
the
statute.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
not
exactly
mr.
justice
fortas
but
it
is
an
attempt
to
take
into
consideration
there
are
certain
depreciations
and
so
forth
that
are
not
within
the
schedules.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
that
is
not
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
allen
covers
that.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
now
i'd
like
to
if
i
may
continue
on
one
point.
mr.
allen
has
contended
has
contended
that
there's
no
relationship
between
enhanced
value
and
allocation
by
a
trackage
format
and
they
cannot
be
applied
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
whether
he
means
a
wholly
inconsistent
or
whether
it's
a
(inaudible)
account
but
that
isn't
true
and
has
not
been
true
since
i
think
probably
the
union
tank
line
company
versus
wright
because
that
same
contention
was
made
in
that
case.
that
you
cannot
use
a
proportion
formula
to
allocate
both
intangible
and
tangible
properties
and
this
court
will
not
specifically
deciding
on
that
issue
did
reaffirm
enhanced
value
so
i
don't
think
that
that
particular
point
has
any
validity
whatsoever.
in
other
words,
it
is
our
position
that
enhanced
value
does
sustain
it,
that
that
is
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
has
recognized
and
we
feel
that
it
is
very
definitely
a
factor
that
at
least
must
be
considered.
now,
the
appellants
have
not
even
recognized
it,
have
not
said
how
can
it
be
computed.
they
assert
that
it
should
be
computed
at
some
other
phase
of
the
assessment.
but
they
have
not
shown
us
what
it
should
be.
and
apparently
it
either
has
no
value
or
they
are
not
recognizing
it
as
having
a
value.
and
certainly,
there's
no
question
about
it
that
it
--
that
there
is
enhanced
value
that
accrues
to
the
separate
pieces
of
equipment
being
assessed
when
they're
part
of
a
going
concern.
that
particularly
there
is
absolutely
no
surprise.
so
it
is
directly
on
that
point
that
missouri
supreme
court
has
affirmed
this
case
and
it
is
on
that
point
that
we
feel
that
this
court
should
sustain
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please.
mr.
allen's
statement
of
the
issue
here
i
agree
with.
the
issue
precisely
before
the
court
we
feel
is
whether
or
not
the
1965
ad
valorem
tax
is
grossly
excessive.
the
only
part
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
excuse
me.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
is
grossly
excessive
and
if
it
is
grossly
excessive
within
the
standard
of
the
case
that
attribute
constitutional
problems
to
this
then
undoubtedly
it
would
be
or
could
be
a
burden
under
state
commerce
and
or
violates
a
due
process
clause
as
it
applies
to
the
states.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
if
i
understand
you
correctly
--
your
question
correctly
sir,
it
would
be
whether
or
not
i
suppose
the
tax
is
reasonably
related
to
the
commerce
conducted
in
the
state,
do
i
understand
you?
mr.
william

peterson
yes.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
oh
not
at
all.
not
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
well
this
is
--
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
this
is
of
course
the
appellant's
contention
that
it
is.
and
the
state
tax
commission
is
taking
the
position
consistently
and
has
been
sustained
by
the
circuit
court
of
cole
county
on
judicial
review
and
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
that
it
is
not
and
the
point
that
we
would
like
to
raise
today
is
that
there
is
complete
authority
both
in
the
laws
as
handed
down
by
this
court
and
the
laws
of
the
state
of
missouri
for
the
tax.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
an
arbitrary
tax,
unsupported
by
findings
or
hearings
at
all.
the

and
i
would
like
to
reiterate
the
facts
just
briefly
here,
not
trying
to
fall
with
mr.
allen's.
assessments
by
the
missouri
tax
commission
are
made
based
on
information
submitted
by
the
railroad
companies
for
doing
business
in
the
state
of
missouri.
it
is
at
this
time,
if
they
disagree
with
the
assessment
that
a
hearing
is
held
pursuant
to
missouri
law.
it
was
at
this
time
a
hearing
was
held
in
this
particular
care
and
the
evidence,
purported
evidence
which
mr.
allen
has
discussed
was
submitted
to
the
commission.
now
the
commission
did
hear
that
evidence.
the
commission
did
make
a
finding
which
is
incorporated
in
the
appendix
to
the
record.
at
that
time
based
on
the
contentions
there
raised
and
these
contentions
as
well
as
others
were
raised.
the
circuit
court
of
cole

in
judicial

did
examine
this
and
the
supreme

of
missouri
did

of

in

fully
adhered

mr.
william
a.
peterson
certainly.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
this
is
what
they're
contending
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
we
do
not
feel
they
are.
mr.
allen
has
stressed
that
the
theory
upon
which
the
missouri
supreme
court
ultimately
sustained
the
missouri
tax
commission
was
the
theory
of
enhanced
value.
now
the
theory
of
enhanced
value
certainly
doesn't
knew

been
constantly
confirmed
by
this
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
don't
know
that

now
the
theory
of
enhance

or
augmented

is
precisely
what
this
case
was
sustained
on
in
the
missouri
supreme
court
not
the
fact
that
missouri
had
to
power
to
tax
three
times
the
amount
of
the
traffic
in
the
state,
of
the
rolling
stock
in
the
state.
that's
not
the
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
if
i
may
sir,
the
formula
of
course
is
the
trackage
percentage
not
--
it's
not

number
of
cars.
it's
the
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes
total
depreciated
equal
less.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
mr.
justice
white,
that
is
correct
if
you
assume
that
that
has
happened.
but
we
know
from
the
teachings
of
this
court
that
if
it
is
a
grossly
excessive
amount
that
it
cannot
stand,
therefore,
it

and
this
is

in

mr.
william
a.
peterson
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
would
say
that
there
are
evidence
in
the
commission
hearing
evidence
that
was
true.
somewhat
greater
number
but
not
any
large
number.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
may
i
answer
this
way,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
missouri
law
sets
down
the
formula,
i
mean
sets
down
how
the
commission
will
reach
a
total
valuation
figure.
now
on
rolling
stock,
the
way
the
commission
reaches
its
valuation
is
to
depreciate
and
equalize
the
entire
rolling
stock
so
in
that
respect,
in
answer
to
your
question
well
it
would
be
yes,
that
there
would
be
a
larger
valuation.
well
we
have
one
more
thing
to
do.
first
of
all,
we
apply
the
equalization
factor
which
45,
47%
then
we
apply
the
track
formula.
so
the
chances
of
getting
a
larger
figure
would
depend
on
the
total
of
depreciated
figure
that
we
began
with
and
unless
that
figure
was
obviously
excessive,
it
would
be
applied.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
mr.
justice
fortas
the
missouri
tax
commission
in
its
findings
explains
the
equalization
factor.
that's
also
on
page
52,
through
55
or
56
but
the
point
is
to
equalize
the
tax
on
the
property
fairly
consistently
with
taxes
on
property
throughout
the
state.
the
commission
explains
--
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
this
--
that
percentage
figure
is
not
mr.
justice
brennan
but
it's
an
attempt
by
the
tax
commission
to
make
it
assessed.
to
just
talk
in
terms
47%
would
not
be
the
whole
story.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
and
it
is
set
out
in
their
finding,
how
they
arrived
with
that.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
yes
mr.
justice
fortas
and
that
also
in
their
finding.
47%
is
applied
to
all
railroads.
the
depreciation
and
equalization
schedules
are
applied
straight
across
the
board.
as
was
an
economic
factor
in
this
case
of
an
excess
$300,000.00
which
is
in
appreciation
of
any
other
financial
things
that
haven't
been
covered,
this
is
also
authorized
by
the
statute.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
not
exactly
mr.
justice
fortas
but
it
is
an
attempt
to
take
into
consideration
there
are
certain
depreciations
and
so
forth
that
are
not
within
the
schedules.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
that
is
not
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
allen
covers
that.
mr.
william
a.
peterson
now
i'd
like
to
if
i
may
continue
on
one
point.
mr.
allen
has
contended
has
contended
that
there's
no
relationship
between
enhanced
value
and
allocation
by
a
trackage
format
and
they
cannot
be
applied
and
i'm
not
quite
sure
whether
he
means
a
wholly
inconsistent
or
whether
it's
a
(inaudible)
account
but
that
isn't
true
and
has
not
been
true
since
i
think
probably
the
union
tank
line
company
versus
wright
because
that
same
contention
was
made
in
that
case.
that
you
cannot
use
a
proportion
formula
to
allocate
both
intangible
and
tangible
properties
and
this
court
will
not
specifically
deciding
on
that
issue
did
reaffirm
enhanced
value
so
i
don't
think
that
that
particular
point
has
any
validity
whatsoever.
in
other
words,
it
is
our
position
that
enhanced
value
does
sustain
it,
that
that
is
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
has
recognized
and
we
feel
that
it
is
very
definitely
a
factor
that
at
least
must
be
considered.
now,
the
appellants
have
not
even
recognized
it,
have
not
said
how
can
it
be
computed.
they
assert
that
it
should
be
computed
at
some
other
phase
of
the
assessment.
but
they
have
not
shown
us
what
it
should
be.
and
apparently
it
either
has
no
value
or
they
are
not
recognizing
it
as
having
a
value.
and
certainly,
there's
no
question
about
it
that
it
--
that
there
is
enhanced
value
that
accrues
to
the
separate
pieces
of
equipment
being
assessed
when
they're
part
of
a
going
concern.
that
particularly
there
is
absolutely
no
surprise.
so
it
is
directly
on
that
point
that
missouri
supreme
court
has
affirmed
this
case
and
it
is
on
that
point
that
we
feel
that
this
court
should
sustain
this
case.
thank
you.
