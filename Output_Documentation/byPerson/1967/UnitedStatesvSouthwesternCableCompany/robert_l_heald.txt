mr.
robert
l.
heald
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
mission
cable
basically
attacks
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
communication
commission
on
two
grounds.
the
first
has
been
covered
very
extensively
with
mr.
scheiner,
but
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
our
position.
we
think
the
failure
of
jurisdiction
is
very
basic
simply
because
title
iii
is
a
licensing
statute
and
that
all
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
their
under
must
be
connected
with,
in
harmony
with,
and
for
the
further
of
this
licensing
function.
of
course,
there
are
specific
statutory
exceptions
that
congress
has
made
like
303
(f).
we
think
this
interpretation
is
consistent
with
statements
of
this
court.
starting
in
1940
in
pottsville,
in
sanders
1943
and
nbc,
and
of
course
in
1950
in
the
carol
case,
this
court
has
described
title
iii
as
a
licensing
section.
now,
the
commission
the
government
has
also
contended
that
they
have
the
right
to
regulate
fcc
--
the
catv
under
the
definition
of
radio
transmissions
and
they
concede
of
course
in
title
iii
is
as
limited
to
radio
or
radio
transmission.
and
mr.
geller
referred
to
the
definition
contained
in
2
(b)
and
2
(d)
of
the
communications
act
which
provides
that
radio
transmissions
cover
any
service
or
communication
that
is
incidental
thereto.
and
mr.
scheiner
has
pointed
out
that
under
this
interpretation
they
claim
jurisdiction
to
regulate
cn
----
the
catv
under
title
iii.
we
think
the
answer
to
this
argument
is
very
simple.
if
they
are
radio
transmissions,
the
present
rules
and
regulations
are
invalid
since
they
do
not
comply
with
the
specific
congressional
directives
contained
in
title
iii.
for
example
they
do
not
proceed
in
written
applications,
they
don't
give
instructions
permits,
they
don't
grant
licenses.
they
don't
determine
the
qualifications
of
the
operator.
equally
important
as
mr.
scheiner
pointed
out
they
don't
give
the
catv
operator
the
protections
provided
in
title
iii
for
station
licensees
and
again,
he
referred
to
section
316
and
326.
and
the
freedom
from
censorship,
i
think
could
not
be
more
clearly
violated
than
the
order
in
this
case
which
prohibits
mission
cable
from
bringing
in
the
signals
of
los
angeles
to
the
san
diego
area.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
would
say
that
that
is
not
within
the
power
the
commission
to
decide.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way.
i
do
understand
that
they
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
no,
that
is
not
sir.
i
concede
they
asked
by
implication,
but
we
suggest
that
if
under
the
definition
if
they
once
argued
the
catv
operations
do
come
as
a
regular
transmissions
then
they
are
stock
with
everything
in
title
iii.
they
can't
come
up
with
what
they
describe
as
a
limited
programming.
in
other
words,
they
either
have
to
stay
in
title
iii
or
they
have
to
get
out
of
it.
they
can't
pick
and
choose
in
title
iii
what
they
want
to
use.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
well,
they're
trying
to
get
out
was
first
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
i
do
not
think
that
--
i
didn't
understand
the
argument
that
way.
they're
using
the
term
incidental
as
a
definition
term
which
brings
him
within
the
build
he
be
classified
as
radio
transmission.
they
are
not
saying
that
that
definition
also
says
that
they
incidentally
can
use
some
powers
to
regulate.
that
as
i
understand
their
argument,
the
words
incidental
to
radio
transmission
means
they
are
the
same
as
radio
transmission
and
therefore,
they
are
under
title
iii.
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
if
they
are
not
radio
transmissions
then
title
iii
clearly
gives
them
no
authority
to
regulate
because
by
their
own
admission
is
limited
to
radio
transmissions.
but
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
our
second
argument
which
we
have
expressed
in
our
briefs
and
which
we
feel
also
that
clearly
shows
that
the
federal
communications
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
catv.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
yes,
i
think
they
would.
i
think
the
analogy
to
the
network
would
be
direct
then.
the
commission
in
nbc
case
have
to
–
been
to
control
the
network
affiliation
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
i'm
directing
my
attention
to
jurisdiction.
they
clearly
have
jurisdiction
over
that
station.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
i
would
suggest
that
for
the
same
reason
i'm
going
to
direct
myself,
they
would
not
have
that
you
would
be
in
a
proper
--
improper
exercise
that
their
authority
to
tell
that
station
it
couldn't
own
a
cable
which
was
extending
it
to
the
great
big
come
to
a
beyond.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
that
is
correct.
and
for
the
separates
of
which
i
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
now
is
that
they
call
it
catv
rules
by
the
commission's
own
admission
in
the
second
report
in
order
by
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
buckeye
case
are
designed
solely
for
the
elimination
of
competition
to
catv
to
the
uhf
stations
primarily.
and
to
limit
the
ability
of
american
citizens
to
watch
signals
that
are
freely
available
to
them
and
do
not
cause
any
electrical
interference
to
any
existing
station.
now
as
i
understood
the
commission
before
did
not
claim
any
explicit
authority
mr.
geller
said,
they
did.
i
understood
they
were
claiming
their
authority
under
an
applied
interpretation
of
the
statute.
then,
they
had
a
little
formula
that
it
went
like
this.
they
said
take
2
(a)
which
is
a
definition
the
commission
has
control
of
all
interstate
communications
by
wire
and
add
to
that
the
rule
making
provisions
of
303
(f),
4
(i),
and
303
(r)
and
apply
that
to
the
substantive
provisions,
307
(b)
and
303
(h)
and
you
come
up
with
jurisdiction.
now,
one
factor
in
this
equation
that
they
don't
particularly
emphasize
is
that
the
rule
making
functions
provide
that
these
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
there
under
must
be
consistent
with
the
act.
and
i
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
under
in
these
implied
powers
the
purposes
of
these
rules
and
regulations
must
be
consistent
with
the
condition
--
congressional
directive
for
purposes
of
enacting
the
act.
now,
this
court
had
occasion
on
numbers
cases
to
point
out,
why
congress
enacted
the
communications
act
and
the
radio
act
of
1927,
its
predecessor.
they
were
concern
according
to
this
court,
that
the
chaos
that
occurred
in
the
radio
that
stations
and
people
by
jumping
stations
from
frequency
to
frequency,
from
community
to
community
were
destroying
all
service
to
the
american
people
so
that
in
effect
their
was
no
radio
service
and
therefore,
it
was
necessary
come
up
with
a
licensing
act
to
control
these
people.
this
court
has
also
stated
that
the
second
purpose
was
that
congress
was
spurred
by
the
fear
monopoly
and
they
were
concerned
that
some
industries
might
gable
up
all
the
large
frequencies
and
place
them
in
a
large
metropolitan
areas
and
this
deprived
other
portions
of
the
united
states
of
the
services
and
as
many
services
as
possible.
these
two
reasons
clearly
point
out
that
congress
was
interested
in
dividing
up
this
electronic
pie
if
you
will
in
as
many
ways
as
possible
consistent
with
the
physical
laws
of
electronic
to
make
as
many
services
as
available
to
many
people
as
possible.
now
under
these
interpretations
consistent
with
these
interpretations,
this
court
for
instance
has
held
that
licensing
per
se
is
not
a
violation
of
freedom
of
speech
because
if
we
don't
have
licenses,
we
will
destroy
everything
and
therefore
it's
not
an
unreasonable
interpretation.
this
court
has
held
in
the
nbc
case
that
congress
had
--
the
commission
has
the
power
to
regulate
the
network
relations,
the
contracts
with
these
--
which
affiliated
stations
in
order
to
provide
better
and
more
services
and
this
was
incidental
to
their
licensing
functions.
and
in
united
states
v.
storer
this
court
has
held
that
the
commission
could
set
up
multiple
ownership
rules
as
incident
to
its
licensing
power
such
it
would
be
useless
to
make
a
commission
on
an
application
to
which
they
have
predetermined
was
already
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
well,
the
commission
is
--
the
government
in
its
brief
has
argued
again
and
again
until
congress
has
bestowed
comprehensive
powers
upon
this
commission
and
we
agree.
but
this
court
had
said
these
powers
are
not
limitless
and
they
must
be
interpreted
in
line
with
the
provisions
of
the
act.
now
with
this
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
two
specific
provisions
that
the
commission
claims
gives
it
the
power
to
regulate
catv
and
this
is
303
(h)
and
307
(b).
now,
303
(h)
provides
as
a
directive
to
the
commission
to
set
up
areas
and
zones
of
service
for
stations.
i'm
sure
this
court
is
aware
at
the
time
the
communications
act
was
enacted,
congress
was
thinking
primarily
of
the
standard
broadcast
band,
that
is
the
band
between
540
and
1600
ghz.
and
they
were
concerned,
that
the
interference
that
was
being
caused
and
congress
was
fully
aware
that
the
factors
that
cause
interference
are
the
same
factors
that
cause
service.
instead
of
broadcast
station
it
is
power
and
frequency
which
results
in
a
usable
service
to
a
certain
period
of
area
and
then
far
beyond
that,
is
a
creation
of
electrical
interference
that
destroys
other
service.
and
this
was
a
directive
to
the
commission
to
set
up
different
types
of
stations
with
different
coverages
and
different
power.
so
again,
they
could
get
as
many
possible
services
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
within
the
capabilities
of
the
physical
laws
of
electronics.
now,
307
(b)
as
the
court
is
aware
provides
that
in
handling
applications
the
commission
should
make
a
fair
and
efficient
distribution
of
services
and
facilities
throughout
the
communities
and
states
insofar
as
there
is
a
demand
for
the
same.
i
suggest
this
again
with
a
clear
indication
that
the
congress
intent
to
make
as
many
services
available
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
as
would
be
possible
within
the
physical
laws
of
electronics
and
not
allow
them
all
to
get
in
one
place.
now
consistent
with
these
two
congressional
directives,
congress
has
come
up
with
this
--
the
commission
has
come
up
with
the
series
of
rules
and
regulations
to
cover
standard
broadcasting
and
television.
in
standard
broadcasting,
they
have
created
classes
of
stations.
there's
a
local
station
which
has
power
up
to
1
kilowatt
or
a
thousand
watts,
250
at
night.
they
have
created
the
regional
stations
with
powers
up
to
five
kilowatts.
clear
channel
stations
of
power
of
the
50
kilowatts,
they
have
day
time
stations.
the
commission
has
recognized
that
in
order
to
get
this
maximum
service,
they
should
limit
the
area
service
but
what
they
are
really
doing,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
not
limiting
the
area
of
service,
they
are
limiting
the
interference
implications
which
go
far
beyond
that
area
service
and
which
there
is
no
practical
way
to
live.
and
congress'
directive
to
create
different
areas
and
zones
was
again
a
clear
directive
to
make
as
many
services
available
to
the
people
of
united
states.
now
in
television,
it's
still
i
might
point
out
is
in
the
sample
that
in
united
states
we
have
a
few
frequencies
with
one's
am
station.
if
all
frequencies
have
one
am
station,
we'd
have
106
stations,
but
with
this
ability
to
create
different
classes
of
stations,
we
have
today
over
4,200
am
stations
operating
in
the
united
states.
now,
the
television
and
commission
did
the
same
thing,
using
a
slightly
different
plan.
they
set
up
the
television
allocation
plan.
they
provided
from
minimum
separation
distances
between
co-channel
and
adjacent
channel
stations
and
this
was
to
prevent
interference.
and
then
based
upon
this
minimum
separation
distances,
they
allocated
television
frequencies
to
all
the
communities
in
the
united
states
as
many
as
possible
while
it
could
still
avoid
interference
based
upon
these
minimum
separations.
and
then
they
limited
the
tower
height
and
the
power
which
were
two
of
the
factors
that
cause
both
service
and
interference
in
television.
so
that
as
many
as
possible,
again,
as
many
stations
as
possible
could
exist
within
this
electronic
spectrum.
now,
the
commission
has
set
up
classes
of
television
service.
there
are
city
grade,
grade
a
and
grade
b.
now
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware
this
grade
b
is
nothing
more
than
imaginary
or
fictional
line
it's
drawn
on
the
chart
which
is
an
engineer's
attempt
to
show
that
at
that
spot,
a
certain
grade
of
service,
a
certain
strength
of
signal
exists.
but
the
commission
has
never
contended
that
service
stops
at
that
grade
b
contour.
service
goes
far
beyond
that.
it
may
be
a
factor
of
terrain,
a
sensitivity
of
the
receiver,
the
height
of
the
antenna.
in
san
diego,
we
have
a
force
of
their
antennas
which
are
listening
off
the
air
to
this
los
angeles
stations.
the
commission
has
never
said
that
every
station
in
the
same
community
must
have
the
same
grade
b
contours.
within
the
limits
of
the
maximum
minimum
power,
they
can
have
any
height
than
any
tower
they
want.
so
in
the
same
city,
you
will
have
stations
with
different
grade
b
contours,
different
service
areas.
but
in
every
case
they
are
limited
by
the
commission's
rules
to
preventing
interference,
to
causing
interference,
beyond
those
grade
b
--
beyond
the
interference
which
is
well
beyond
the
grade
b
contour.
i
submit
that
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
these
two
sections
was
very
clear.
it
was
to
provide
the
max
--
that
the
commission
should
create
the
maximum
number
of
services
possible
within
the
physical
laws
of
electronics.
now,
mr.
geller
stated
at
the
opening
that
the
congressional
--
congress
had
given
the
commission
a
mandate
to
have
local
service
and
he
referred
to
307
(b).
now,
if
he
was
saying
that
congress
gave
the
commission
a
mandate
to
provide
for
frequencies
in
every
community
so
that
they
would
be
available
if
they
were
needed,
i
agree.
i
submit
for
the
fcc
has
gone
wrong
in
the
cat
regulations
as
they
have
attempted
to
go
into
a
new
field
of
economy
–
of
the
economics.
they
have
attempted
to
limit
competition
in
an
attempt
to
guarantee
the
viability
of
uhf
stations
whether
the
people
want
to
see
them
or
not
and
i
submit
that
purpose
is
directly
contrary
to
the
congressional
purpose
in
setting
up
sections
307
(b)
and
303
(h).
now
justice
fortas,
i
think
you
ask
mr.
geller
a
question
the
other
day
as
to
whether
or
not
catv
would
cause
--
would
create
competition
to
the
network
stations?
and
i
think
mr.
geller
misunderstood
your
answer
--
your
question
because
the
answer
no
because
the
duplication
rules
would
prevent
competition.
i
assume
your
question
was
directed
to
point
would
unregulated
catv
cause
competition
to
networks
and
the
answer
in
emphatically,
yes.
they
would
be
the
prime
source
of
competition
and
the
federal
government,
the
district
--
department
of
justice
in
its
brief
in
a
district
–
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
itt
case,
specifically
propose
the
merger
on
the
grounds
that
itt
was
going
into
the
catv
business
and
this
would
be
greatest
possible
source
of
competition
to
the
networks.
now,
we
have
also
asked
this
court
to
reconsider
and
clarify
its
language
in
the
sander's
case
which
we
think
is
an
eminently
sound
decision,
since
it
holds
that
broadcasting
is
free.
it
is
a
freely
competitive
business
and
that
the
commission
has
no
control
over
the
business
of
broadcasting
and
that
the
broadcaster
must
stay
on
the
fall
upon
the
acceptability
of
his
product.
unfortunately,
there
is
some
other
language
in
the
case
that
commission
in
licensing
stations
must
consider
impact
of
competition
on
the
public.
and
as
the
result
of
that
language
as
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
district
columbia
circuit
on
the
caroll
case
has
come
up
with
the
rule
of
the
commission
must
consider
the
protest
or
the
petitioner
of
an
existing
station,
if
it
objects
to
a
new
license
being
granted
in
the
same
community
that
alleges
that
the
competition
will
hurt
the
public.
now,
there
have
been
a
lot
of
cases
started
to
that
rule.
there
been
a
lot
of
hearings,
but
i
know
of
no
instance
from
the
federal
communications
commission
has
denied
a
license
with
the
finding
that
the
competition
from
other
station
will
be
detrimental
to
the
public.
now,
the
commission
is
aware
and
i'm
sure
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
that
time
after
time
stations
and
communities
are
not
financially
successful
and
they
go
through
one
owner
and
two-owner,
and
three
owners
until
finally
somebody
gets
hold
of
that
station
and
for
some
reason,
either
initiative
hard
work
knowledge
of
local
conditions
he
makes
it
successful
and
it
starts
producing
a
product
that
the
people
want
to
watch
and
then
it
starts
contributing
to
the
welfare
of
that
community.
now
broadcasting
is
something
unique,
it
is
something
that's
based
upon
an
initiative,
all
other
forms
of
information,
entertainment,
education,
or
in
competition
and
we
submit
congress
wisely
left
the
broadcasting
business
to
be
in
competition
and
broadcast
station
should
rely
upon
their
product.
and
we
submit
that
here,
where
non-micro
way
catv
does
in
no
way
causes
electrical
interference
to
existing
stations,
in
no
way
prevents
the
development
of
local
stations,
if
there
is
a
demand
from
the
citizens
for
that
station,
in
no
way
prevents
any
person
from
watching,
if
he's
desire
friends
to
see
--
when
the
catv
comes
in
upon
his
request,
he
can
have
a
switch
put
in
and
still
contain
--
maintain
his
outside
antenna.
it's
strictly
within
his
control
what
he
wants
to
watch.
i
submit
that
the
purpose
of
the
catv
rules
are
diametrically
opposed
to
the
intend
of
congress
and
that
enacting
both
the
act
in
these
two
specific
sections
which
the
commission
is
relying
upon
and
for
that
reason
it's
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
am
going
to
take
to
try
and
guess
why
congress
has
enacted
perhaps
express
in
considering
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
as
to
why
they
have
not
acted?
no.
there
is
nothing
in
the
reports.
they
must
be
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
now,
we
feel
on
the
contrary
that
this
is
such
a
complicated
subject
and
it
is
the
extending
the
power
of
the
commission
into
a
brand
new
field
which
congress
has
never
considered
the
administrative
agency
should
act
before,
that
inaction
is
only
because
of
the
complicated
subject
that
is
involved.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
because
we
have
--
they
have
just
not
have
time
to
consider.
now
some
of
the
unanswered
questions
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
would
hope
they
would
take
the
time
to
examine
any
complicated
questions
that
arise.
and
i
think
one
for
instance
that
is
bother
than
is
whether
not
catv's
can
originate?
and
this
is
a
question
that
is
now
before
the
commission
and
whether
or
not
the
commission
can
prohibit
that
either
under
present
rules
is
whether
congress
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
that's
correct.
in
addition,
as
you
know
a
catv
system
have
multiple
channels.
the
ones
in
san
diego
have
12
channels
and
they
use
some
of
those
channels
or
can
use
some
of
those
channels
to
other
things
other
than
bringing
in
television.
and
they
could
originate
there
own
programs,
the
news
program
or
weather
program,
and
film
so
the
capability
of
catv,
the
effect
on
economic
status,
i
submit
such
a
complicated
subject
that
the
inference
that
congress
has
not
acted
at
this
time
is
not
that
they
agree
that
the
commission
has
so
far
but
perhaps
it
is
such
a
complicated
subject
that
they
want
to
time
the
act
upon
it
first.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
they've
had
i
think
two
years.
well,
they
asked
first
in
196o
when
congress
--
when
commission
didn't
ask
for
it
in
a
very
hard
way
and
in
the
second
time,
they
ask
for
it
and
as
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
hearings
and
what
extent
it
was
argued.
but
i
do
know
there
was
a
very
strenuous
minority
report
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
which
specifically
points
out,
why
the
commission
should
not
have
jurisdiction.
and
raises
the
very
problems
the
complications
will
arise
unless
congress
fully
considers
them.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
you
raised
the
question
as
what
was
the
answer
to
the
reasonableness
problem
that
mr.
geller
raises.
now
the
force
of
course
is,
we've
emphasized
that
there
is
no
electrical
interference.
the
point
is
that
its
only
economic
impact.
i
suggest
that
mr.
geller
may
have
a
very
reasonable
argument.
there
maybe
a
need
for
economic
control
against
to
ensure
the
viability
of
vhf
and
uhf
television.
they're
may
be
a
need
to
limit
the
right
of
american
public
to
watch
television
channels
that
are
freely
available
to
them.
there
may
be
even
a
need
to
give
this
power
to
the
federal
communications
commission
and
administrative
agency
but
i
suggest
that
is
a
matter
for
congress
and
mr.
geller's
argument
is
directed
to
the
wrong
forum
since
a
federal
agency
should
not
be
allowed
to
take
itself
up
by
its
foot
straps
and
launch
itself
into
a
new
field,
find
you
the
control
of
economics,
competition
without
specific
congressional
direction.
now
with
time
remaining
to
i
would
like
to
adjust
myself
for
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
which
it
said
this
commission
didn't
have
the
power
to
which
you
would
stay
ordered.
we
think
the
decision
is
eminently
sound
and
that
the
court
made
have
very
fine
analysis
of
the
powers
to
commission.
and
they
very
briefly
pointed
out
that
under
the
rule
making
sections
4
(i),
303
(f),
and
303
(r)
which
says
that,
the
powers
must
be
consistent
with
the
act.
that
if
they
had
the
tremendous
power,
if
the
commission
has
the
tremendous
power
to
issue
a
stay
without
a
hearing
and
upon
disputes
of
fact
because
there
is
a
lot
of
disputes
of
fact
in
this
petition
in
which
they
acted.
they
had
asked
the
congress
to
do
a
useless
thing
in
enacting
312
(b)
because
they
clearly
have
the
authority
to
do
everything
that
312
(b)
gave
them.
they
also
asked
the
commission
--
congress
to
do
i
useless
thing
when
it
given
the
parts
to
find
its
forfeitures
because
i
submit,
that
would
clearly
be
encompassed
in
this
broad
authority
they
now
claiming.
it
is
also
equal
important
that
when
congress
did
decide
to
give
them
some
additional
power
cease
and
desist,
after
they
claim,
they
had
no
right
except
the
power
to
revoke
licenses,
the
congress
very
carefully
hedged
that
power
in
with
limitations
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
licensee.
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
where
the
federal
agency
claims
that
under
the
implied
power
it's
taking
out
of
specifics,
it
has
greater
power
than
it
has
under
the
specific
authority
granted
to
it
by
congress.
and
mr.
geller
has
pointed
out
in
his
oral
argument
and
he
is
also
pointed
in
his
brief
that
the
commission
could
have
proceeded
by
a
general
order
in
this
rule
making.
they
could
have
come
up
with
an
order
saying
that
all
catv
stops
here.
now,
they
cite
no
authority
for
this
and
we
don't
concede
they
would
have
this
authority
even
though,
we
go
under
the
premise
they
have
something
have
jurisdictional
with
catv.
specifically,
they
would
not
have
the
authority
by
a
rule
making
to
issue
a
general
order
saying
that
all
vhf
televisions
have
to
go
off
the
air
at
8
o'clock
in
order
to
give
uhf
economic
protection.
the
section
316
would
prohibit
that
because
of
the
modification
and
license
and
then
entitled
adjudicatory
hearing.
but
we
really
think
the
argument
is
beside
the
point.
the
commission
elected
to
follow
another
procedure.
they
didn't
go
by
the
state
order.
they
didn't
attempt
by
a
stay
order
to
control
the
lawful
operations
of
the
catv
systems.
they
elected
to
go
on
the
ad
hoc
basis
and
use
a
stay
authority
and
an
interlocutory
type
of
authority
and
we
submit
they
clearly
do
not
have
that
authority.
and
the
syracuse
case
that
he
refers
to
which
upholds
the
authority
of
agency
that
either
go
by
general
rule
making
or
specific
case,
as
i
read
it
says,
our
goals
on
the
assumption
that
is
clear
that
the
agency
has
both
those
powers
and
the
case
says
it's
in
our
discretion
to
go
one
way
to
the
other.
here
the
key
is
and
we
dispute
that
they
have
the
authority
to
go
on
the
second
method
and
if
they
lacked
the
power
to
issue
a
temporally
injunction
to
stop
the
lawful
activities
upon
pleadings
which
are
completely
in
dispute
as
to
fact,
we
submit,
they
do
not
have
authority
to
issue
a
temporally
stay.
for
that
basis
we
feel
to
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
was
eminently
sound,
it
is
correct,
and
should
be
affirm
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
mission
cable
basically
attacks
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
communication
commission
on
two
grounds.
the
first
has
been
covered
very
extensively
with
mr.
scheiner,
but
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
our
position.
we
think
the
failure
of
jurisdiction
is
very
basic
simply
because
title
iii
is
a
licensing
statute
and
that
all
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
their
under
must
be
connected
with,
in
harmony
with,
and
for
the
further
of
this
licensing
function.
of
course,
there
are
specific
statutory
exceptions
that
congress
has
made
like
303
(f).
we
think
this
interpretation
is
consistent
with
statements
of
this
court.
starting
in
1940
in
pottsville,
in
sanders
1943
and
nbc,
and
of
course
in
1950
in
the
carol
case,
this
court
has
described
title
iii
as
a
licensing
section.
now,
the
commission
the
government
has
also
contended
that
they
have
the
right
to
regulate
fcc
--
the
catv
under
the
definition
of
radio
transmissions
and
they
concede
of
course
in
title
iii
is
as
limited
to
radio
or
radio
transmission.
and
mr.
geller
referred
to
the
definition
contained
in
2
(b)
and
2
(d)
of
the
communications
act
which
provides
that
radio
transmissions
cover
any
service
or
communication
that
is
incidental
thereto.
and
mr.
scheiner
has
pointed
out
that
under
this
interpretation
they
claim
jurisdiction
to
regulate
cn
----
the
catv
under
title
iii.
we
think
the
answer
to
this
argument
is
very
simple.
if
they
are
radio
transmissions,
the
present
rules
and
regulations
are
invalid
since
they
do
not
comply
with
the
specific
congressional
directives
contained
in
title
iii.
for
example
they
do
not
proceed
in
written
applications,
they
don't
give
instructions
permits,
they
don't
grant
licenses.
they
don't
determine
the
qualifications
of
the
operator.
equally
important
as
mr.
scheiner
pointed
out
they
don't
give
the
catv
operator
the
protections
provided
in
title
iii
for
station
licensees
and
again,
he
referred
to
section
316
and
326.
and
the
freedom
from
censorship,
i
think
could
not
be
more
clearly
violated
than
the
order
in
this
case
which
prohibits
mission
cable
from
bringing
in
the
signals
of
los
angeles
to
the
san
diego
area.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
mr.
justice
fortas,
we
would
say
that
that
is
not
within
the
power
the
commission
to
decide.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way.
i
do
understand
that
they
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
no,
that
is
not
sir.
i
concede
they
asked
by
implication,
but
we
suggest
that
if
under
the
definition
if
they
once
argued
the
catv
operations
do
come
as
a
regular
transmissions
then
they
are
stock
with
everything
in
title
iii.
they
can't
come
up
with
what
they
describe
as
a
limited
programming.
in
other
words,
they
either
have
to
stay
in
title
iii
or
they
have
to
get
out
of
it.
they
can't
pick
and
choose
in
title
iii
what
they
want
to
use.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
well,
they're
trying
to
get
out
was
first
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
i
do
not
think
that
--
i
didn't
understand
the
argument
that
way.
they're
using
the
term
incidental
as
a
definition
term
which
brings
him
within
the
build
he
be
classified
as
radio
transmission.
they
are
not
saying
that
that
definition
also
says
that
they
incidentally
can
use
some
powers
to
regulate.
that
as
i
understand
their
argument,
the
words
incidental
to
radio
transmission
means
they
are
the
same
as
radio
transmission
and
therefore,
they
are
under
title
iii.
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
if
they
are
not
radio
transmissions
then
title
iii
clearly
gives
them
no
authority
to
regulate
because
by
their
own
admission
is
limited
to
radio
transmissions.
but
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
our
second
argument
which
we
have
expressed
in
our
briefs
and
which
we
feel
also
that
clearly
shows
that
the
federal
communications
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
over
catv.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
yes,
i
think
they
would.
i
think
the
analogy
to
the
network
would
be
direct
then.
the
commission
in
nbc
case
have
to
–
been
to
control
the
network
affiliation
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
i'm
directing
my
attention
to
jurisdiction.
they
clearly
have
jurisdiction
over
that
station.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
i
would
suggest
that
for
the
same
reason
i'm
going
to
direct
myself,
they
would
not
have
that
you
would
be
in
a
proper
--
improper
exercise
that
their
authority
to
tell
that
station
it
couldn't
own
a
cable
which
was
extending
it
to
the
great
big
come
to
a
beyond.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
that
is
correct.
and
for
the
separates
of
which
i
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
now
is
that
they
call
it
catv
rules
by
the
commission's
own
admission
in
the
second
report
in
order
by
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
buckeye
case
are
designed
solely
for
the
elimination
of
competition
to
catv
to
the
uhf
stations
primarily.
and
to
limit
the
ability
of
american
citizens
to
watch
signals
that
are
freely
available
to
them
and
do
not
cause
any
electrical
interference
to
any
existing
station.
now
as
i
understood
the
commission
before
did
not
claim
any
explicit
authority
mr.
geller
said,
they
did.
i
understood
they
were
claiming
their
authority
under
an
applied
interpretation
of
the
statute.
then,
they
had
a
little
formula
that
it
went
like
this.
they
said
take
2
(a)
which
is
a
definition
the
commission
has
control
of
all
interstate
communications
by
wire
and
add
to
that
the
rule
making
provisions
of
303
(f),
4
(i),
and
303
(r)
and
apply
that
to
the
substantive
provisions,
307
(b)
and
303
(h)
and
you
come
up
with
jurisdiction.
now,
one
factor
in
this
equation
that
they
don't
particularly
emphasize
is
that
the
rule
making
functions
provide
that
these
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
there
under
must
be
consistent
with
the
act.
and
i
also
suggest
to
the
court
that
under
in
these
implied
powers
the
purposes
of
these
rules
and
regulations
must
be
consistent
with
the
condition
--
congressional
directive
for
purposes
of
enacting
the
act.
now,
this
court
had
occasion
on
numbers
cases
to
point
out,
why
congress
enacted
the
communications
act
and
the
radio
act
of
1927,
its
predecessor.
they
were
concern
according
to
this
court,
that
the
chaos
that
occurred
in
the
radio
that
stations
and
people
by
jumping
stations
from
frequency
to
frequency,
from
community
to
community
were
destroying
all
service
to
the
american
people
so
that
in
effect
their
was
no
radio
service
and
therefore,
it
was
necessary
come
up
with
a
licensing
act
to
control
these
people.
this
court
has
also
stated
that
the
second
purpose
was
that
congress
was
spurred
by
the
fear
monopoly
and
they
were
concerned
that
some
industries
might
gable
up
all
the
large
frequencies
and
place
them
in
a
large
metropolitan
areas
and
this
deprived
other
portions
of
the
united
states
of
the
services
and
as
many
services
as
possible.
these
two
reasons
clearly
point
out
that
congress
was
interested
in
dividing
up
this
electronic
pie
if
you
will
in
as
many
ways
as
possible
consistent
with
the
physical
laws
of
electronic
to
make
as
many
services
as
available
to
many
people
as
possible.
now
under
these
interpretations
consistent
with
these
interpretations,
this
court
for
instance
has
held
that
licensing
per
se
is
not
a
violation
of
freedom
of
speech
because
if
we
don't
have
licenses,
we
will
destroy
everything
and
therefore
it's
not
an
unreasonable
interpretation.
this
court
has
held
in
the
nbc
case
that
congress
had
--
the
commission
has
the
power
to
regulate
the
network
relations,
the
contracts
with
these
--
which
affiliated
stations
in
order
to
provide
better
and
more
services
and
this
was
incidental
to
their
licensing
functions.
and
in
united
states
v.
storer
this
court
has
held
that
the
commission
could
set
up
multiple
ownership
rules
as
incident
to
its
licensing
power
such
it
would
be
useless
to
make
a
commission
on
an
application
to
which
they
have
predetermined
was
already
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
well,
the
commission
is
--
the
government
in
its
brief
has
argued
again
and
again
until
congress
has
bestowed
comprehensive
powers
upon
this
commission
and
we
agree.
but
this
court
had
said
these
powers
are
not
limitless
and
they
must
be
interpreted
in
line
with
the
provisions
of
the
act.
now
with
this
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
two
specific
provisions
that
the
commission
claims
gives
it
the
power
to
regulate
catv
and
this
is
303
(h)
and
307
(b).
now,
303
(h)
provides
as
a
directive
to
the
commission
to
set
up
areas
and
zones
of
service
for
stations.
i'm
sure
this
court
is
aware
at
the
time
the
communications
act
was
enacted,
congress
was
thinking
primarily
of
the
standard
broadcast
band,
that
is
the
band
between
540
and
1600
ghz.
and
they
were
concerned,
that
the
interference
that
was
being
caused
and
congress
was
fully
aware
that
the
factors
that
cause
interference
are
the
same
factors
that
cause
service.
instead
of
broadcast
station
it
is
power
and
frequency
which
results
in
a
usable
service
to
a
certain
period
of
area
and
then
far
beyond
that,
is
a
creation
of
electrical
interference
that
destroys
other
service.
and
this
was
a
directive
to
the
commission
to
set
up
different
types
of
stations
with
different
coverages
and
different
power.
so
again,
they
could
get
as
many
possible
services
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
within
the
capabilities
of
the
physical
laws
of
electronics.
now,
307
(b)
as
the
court
is
aware
provides
that
in
handling
applications
the
commission
should
make
a
fair
and
efficient
distribution
of
services
and
facilities
throughout
the
communities
and
states
insofar
as
there
is
a
demand
for
the
same.
i
suggest
this
again
with
a
clear
indication
that
the
congress
intent
to
make
as
many
services
available
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states
as
would
be
possible
within
the
physical
laws
of
electronics
and
not
allow
them
all
to
get
in
one
place.
now
consistent
with
these
two
congressional
directives,
congress
has
come
up
with
this
--
the
commission
has
come
up
with
the
series
of
rules
and
regulations
to
cover
standard
broadcasting
and
television.
in
standard
broadcasting,
they
have
created
classes
of
stations.
there's
a
local
station
which
has
power
up
to
1
kilowatt
or
a
thousand
watts,
250
at
night.
they
have
created
the
regional
stations
with
powers
up
to
five
kilowatts.
clear
channel
stations
of
power
of
the
50
kilowatts,
they
have
day
time
stations.
the
commission
has
recognized
that
in
order
to
get
this
maximum
service,
they
should
limit
the
area
service
but
what
they
are
really
doing,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
not
limiting
the
area
of
service,
they
are
limiting
the
interference
implications
which
go
far
beyond
that
area
service
and
which
there
is
no
practical
way
to
live.
and
congress'
directive
to
create
different
areas
and
zones
was
again
a
clear
directive
to
make
as
many
services
available
to
the
people
of
united
states.
now
in
television,
it's
still
i
might
point
out
is
in
the
sample
that
in
united
states
we
have
a
few
frequencies
with
one's
am
station.
if
all
frequencies
have
one
am
station,
we'd
have
106
stations,
but
with
this
ability
to
create
different
classes
of
stations,
we
have
today
over
4,200
am
stations
operating
in
the
united
states.
now,
the
television
and
commission
did
the
same
thing,
using
a
slightly
different
plan.
they
set
up
the
television
allocation
plan.
they
provided
from
minimum
separation
distances
between
co-channel
and
adjacent
channel
stations
and
this
was
to
prevent
interference.
and
then
based
upon
this
minimum
separation
distances,
they
allocated
television
frequencies
to
all
the
communities
in
the
united
states
as
many
as
possible
while
it
could
still
avoid
interference
based
upon
these
minimum
separations.
and
then
they
limited
the
tower
height
and
the
power
which
were
two
of
the
factors
that
cause
both
service
and
interference
in
television.
so
that
as
many
as
possible,
again,
as
many
stations
as
possible
could
exist
within
this
electronic
spectrum.
now,
the
commission
has
set
up
classes
of
television
service.
there
are
city
grade,
grade
a
and
grade
b.
now
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware
this
grade
b
is
nothing
more
than
imaginary
or
fictional
line
it's
drawn
on
the
chart
which
is
an
engineer's
attempt
to
show
that
at
that
spot,
a
certain
grade
of
service,
a
certain
strength
of
signal
exists.
but
the
commission
has
never
contended
that
service
stops
at
that
grade
b
contour.
service
goes
far
beyond
that.
it
may
be
a
factor
of
terrain,
a
sensitivity
of
the
receiver,
the
height
of
the
antenna.
in
san
diego,
we
have
a
force
of
their
antennas
which
are
listening
off
the
air
to
this
los
angeles
stations.
the
commission
has
never
said
that
every
station
in
the
same
community
must
have
the
same
grade
b
contours.
within
the
limits
of
the
maximum
minimum
power,
they
can
have
any
height
than
any
tower
they
want.
so
in
the
same
city,
you
will
have
stations
with
different
grade
b
contours,
different
service
areas.
but
in
every
case
they
are
limited
by
the
commission's
rules
to
preventing
interference,
to
causing
interference,
beyond
those
grade
b
--
beyond
the
interference
which
is
well
beyond
the
grade
b
contour.
i
submit
that
the
purpose
of
congress
in
enacting
these
two
sections
was
very
clear.
it
was
to
provide
the
max
--
that
the
commission
should
create
the
maximum
number
of
services
possible
within
the
physical
laws
of
electronics.
now,
mr.
geller
stated
at
the
opening
that
the
congressional
--
congress
had
given
the
commission
a
mandate
to
have
local
service
and
he
referred
to
307
(b).
now,
if
he
was
saying
that
congress
gave
the
commission
a
mandate
to
provide
for
frequencies
in
every
community
so
that
they
would
be
available
if
they
were
needed,
i
agree.
i
submit
for
the
fcc
has
gone
wrong
in
the
cat
regulations
as
they
have
attempted
to
go
into
a
new
field
of
economy
–
of
the
economics.
they
have
attempted
to
limit
competition
in
an
attempt
to
guarantee
the
viability
of
uhf
stations
whether
the
people
want
to
see
them
or
not
and
i
submit
that
purpose
is
directly
contrary
to
the
congressional
purpose
in
setting
up
sections
307
(b)
and
303
(h).
now
justice
fortas,
i
think
you
ask
mr.
geller
a
question
the
other
day
as
to
whether
or
not
catv
would
cause
--
would
create
competition
to
the
network
stations?
and
i
think
mr.
geller
misunderstood
your
answer
--
your
question
because
the
answer
no
because
the
duplication
rules
would
prevent
competition.
i
assume
your
question
was
directed
to
point
would
unregulated
catv
cause
competition
to
networks
and
the
answer
in
emphatically,
yes.
they
would
be
the
prime
source
of
competition
and
the
federal
government,
the
district
--
department
of
justice
in
its
brief
in
a
district
–
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
in
the
itt
case,
specifically
propose
the
merger
on
the
grounds
that
itt
was
going
into
the
catv
business
and
this
would
be
greatest
possible
source
of
competition
to
the
networks.
now,
we
have
also
asked
this
court
to
reconsider
and
clarify
its
language
in
the
sander's
case
which
we
think
is
an
eminently
sound
decision,
since
it
holds
that
broadcasting
is
free.
it
is
a
freely
competitive
business
and
that
the
commission
has
no
control
over
the
business
of
broadcasting
and
that
the
broadcaster
must
stay
on
the
fall
upon
the
acceptability
of
his
product.
unfortunately,
there
is
some
other
language
in
the
case
that
commission
in
licensing
stations
must
consider
impact
of
competition
on
the
public.
and
as
the
result
of
that
language
as
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
district
columbia
circuit
on
the
caroll
case
has
come
up
with
the
rule
of
the
commission
must
consider
the
protest
or
the
petitioner
of
an
existing
station,
if
it
objects
to
a
new
license
being
granted
in
the
same
community
that
alleges
that
the
competition
will
hurt
the
public.
now,
there
have
been
a
lot
of
cases
started
to
that
rule.
there
been
a
lot
of
hearings,
but
i
know
of
no
instance
from
the
federal
communications
commission
has
denied
a
license
with
the
finding
that
the
competition
from
other
station
will
be
detrimental
to
the
public.
now,
the
commission
is
aware
and
i'm
sure
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice
that
time
after
time
stations
and
communities
are
not
financially
successful
and
they
go
through
one
owner
and
two-owner,
and
three
owners
until
finally
somebody
gets
hold
of
that
station
and
for
some
reason,
either
initiative
hard
work
knowledge
of
local
conditions
he
makes
it
successful
and
it
starts
producing
a
product
that
the
people
want
to
watch
and
then
it
starts
contributing
to
the
welfare
of
that
community.
now
broadcasting
is
something
unique,
it
is
something
that's
based
upon
an
initiative,
all
other
forms
of
information,
entertainment,
education,
or
in
competition
and
we
submit
congress
wisely
left
the
broadcasting
business
to
be
in
competition
and
broadcast
station
should
rely
upon
their
product.
and
we
submit
that
here,
where
non-micro
way
catv
does
in
no
way
causes
electrical
interference
to
existing
stations,
in
no
way
prevents
the
development
of
local
stations,
if
there
is
a
demand
from
the
citizens
for
that
station,
in
no
way
prevents
any
person
from
watching,
if
he's
desire
friends
to
see
--
when
the
catv
comes
in
upon
his
request,
he
can
have
a
switch
put
in
and
still
contain
--
maintain
his
outside
antenna.
it's
strictly
within
his
control
what
he
wants
to
watch.
i
submit
that
the
purpose
of
the
catv
rules
are
diametrically
opposed
to
the
intend
of
congress
and
that
enacting
both
the
act
in
these
two
specific
sections
which
the
commission
is
relying
upon
and
for
that
reason
it's
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
am
going
to
take
to
try
and
guess
why
congress
has
enacted
perhaps
express
in
considering
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
as
to
why
they
have
not
acted?
no.
there
is
nothing
in
the
reports.
they
must
be
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
now,
we
feel
on
the
contrary
that
this
is
such
a
complicated
subject
and
it
is
the
extending
the
power
of
the
commission
into
a
brand
new
field
which
congress
has
never
considered
the
administrative
agency
should
act
before,
that
inaction
is
only
because
of
the
complicated
subject
that
is
involved.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
because
we
have
--
they
have
just
not
have
time
to
consider.
now
some
of
the
unanswered
questions
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
would
hope
they
would
take
the
time
to
examine
any
complicated
questions
that
arise.
and
i
think
one
for
instance
that
is
bother
than
is
whether
not
catv's
can
originate?
and
this
is
a
question
that
is
now
before
the
commission
and
whether
or
not
the
commission
can
prohibit
that
either
under
present
rules
is
whether
congress
--
mr.
robert
l.
heald
that's
correct.
in
addition,
as
you
know
a
catv
system
have
multiple
channels.
the
ones
in
san
diego
have
12
channels
and
they
use
some
of
those
channels
or
can
use
some
of
those
channels
to
other
things
other
than
bringing
in
television.
and
they
could
originate
there
own
programs,
the
news
program
or
weather
program,
and
film
so
the
capability
of
catv,
the
effect
on
economic
status,
i
submit
such
a
complicated
subject
that
the
inference
that
congress
has
not
acted
at
this
time
is
not
that
they
agree
that
the
commission
has
so
far
but
perhaps
it
is
such
a
complicated
subject
that
they
want
to
time
the
act
upon
it
first.
mr.
robert
l.
heald
they've
had
i
think
two
years.
well,
they
asked
first
in
196o
when
congress
--
when
commission
didn't
ask
for
it
in
a
very
hard
way
and
in
the
second
time,
they
ask
for
it
and
as
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
hearings
and
what
extent
it
was
argued.
but
i
do
know
there
was
a
very
strenuous
minority
report
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
which
specifically
points
out,
why
the
commission
should
not
have
jurisdiction.
and
raises
the
very
problems
the
complications
will
arise
unless
congress
fully
considers
them.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
you
raised
the
question
as
what
was
the
answer
to
the
reasonableness
problem
that
mr.
geller
raises.
now
the
force
of
course
is,
we've
emphasized
that
there
is
no
electrical
interference.
the
point
is
that
its
only
economic
impact.
i
suggest
that
mr.
geller
may
have
a
very
reasonable
argument.
there
maybe
a
need
for
economic
control
against
to
ensure
the
viability
of
vhf
and
uhf
television.
they're
may
be
a
need
to
limit
the
right
of
american
public
to
watch
television
channels
that
are
freely
available
to
them.
there
may
be
even
a
need
to
give
this
power
to
the
federal
communications
commission
and
administrative
agency
but
i
suggest
that
is
a
matter
for
congress
and
mr.
geller's
argument
is
directed
to
the
wrong
forum
since
a
federal
agency
should
not
be
allowed
to
take
itself
up
by
its
foot
straps
and
launch
itself
into
a
new
field,
find
you
the
control
of
economics,
competition
without
specific
congressional
direction.
now
with
time
remaining
to
i
would
like
to
adjust
myself
for
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
which
it
said
this
commission
didn't
have
the
power
to
which
you
would
stay
ordered.
we
think
the
decision
is
eminently
sound
and
that
the
court
made
have
very
fine
analysis
of
the
powers
to
commission.
and
they
very
briefly
pointed
out
that
under
the
rule
making
sections
4
(i),
303
(f),
and
303
(r)
which
says
that,
the
powers
must
be
consistent
with
the
act.
that
if
they
had
the
tremendous
power,
if
the
commission
has
the
tremendous
power
to
issue
a
stay
without
a
hearing
and
upon
disputes
of
fact
because
there
is
a
lot
of
disputes
of
fact
in
this
petition
in
which
they
acted.
they
had
asked
the
congress
to
do
a
useless
thing
in
enacting
312
(b)
because
they
clearly
have
the
authority
to
do
everything
that
312
(b)
gave
them.
they
also
asked
the
commission
--
congress
to
do
i
useless
thing
when
it
given
the
parts
to
find
its
forfeitures
because
i
submit,
that
would
clearly
be
encompassed
in
this
broad
authority
they
now
claiming.
it
is
also
equal
important
that
when
congress
did
decide
to
give
them
some
additional
power
cease
and
desist,
after
they
claim,
they
had
no
right
except
the
power
to
revoke
licenses,
the
congress
very
carefully
hedged
that
power
in
with
limitations
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
licensee.
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
where
the
federal
agency
claims
that
under
the
implied
power
it's
taking
out
of
specifics,
it
has
greater
power
than
it
has
under
the
specific
authority
granted
to
it
by
congress.
and
mr.
geller
has
pointed
out
in
his
oral
argument
and
he
is
also
pointed
in
his
brief
that
the
commission
could
have
proceeded
by
a
general
order
in
this
rule
making.
they
could
have
come
up
with
an
order
saying
that
all
catv
stops
here.
now,
they
cite
no
authority
for
this
and
we
don't
concede
they
would
have
this
authority
even
though,
we
go
under
the
premise
they
have
something
have
jurisdictional
with
catv.
specifically,
they
would
not
have
the
authority
by
a
rule
making
to
issue
a
general
order
saying
that
all
vhf
televisions
have
to
go
off
the
air
at
8
o'clock
in
order
to
give
uhf
economic
protection.
the
section
316
would
prohibit
that
because
of
the
modification
and
license
and
then
entitled
adjudicatory
hearing.
but
we
really
think
the
argument
is
beside
the
point.
the
commission
elected
to
follow
another
procedure.
they
didn't
go
by
the
state
order.
they
didn't
attempt
by
a
stay
order
to
control
the
lawful
operations
of
the
catv
systems.
they
elected
to
go
on
the
ad
hoc
basis
and
use
a
stay
authority
and
an
interlocutory
type
of
authority
and
we
submit
they
clearly
do
not
have
that
authority.
and
the
syracuse
case
that
he
refers
to
which
upholds
the
authority
of
agency
that
either
go
by
general
rule
making
or
specific
case,
as
i
read
it
says,
our
goals
on
the
assumption
that
is
clear
that
the
agency
has
both
those
powers
and
the
case
says
it's
in
our
discretion
to
go
one
way
to
the
other.
here
the
key
is
and
we
dispute
that
they
have
the
authority
to
go
on
the
second
method
and
if
they
lacked
the
power
to
issue
a
temporally
injunction
to
stop
the
lawful
activities
upon
pleadings
which
are
completely
in
dispute
as
to
fact,
we
submit,
they
do
not
have
authority
to
issue
a
temporally
stay.
for
that
basis
we
feel
to
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
was
eminently
sound,
it
is
correct,
and
should
be
affirm
by
this
court.
