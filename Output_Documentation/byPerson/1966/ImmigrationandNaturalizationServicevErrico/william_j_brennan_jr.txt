william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
has
all
of
these
been
changed
by
each
provisions
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
was
just
wondering
how
big
a
problem
is
this
in
number
any
idea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
he
(inaudible)
re-enter
under
the
(inaudible)
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let's
see
he
is
the
parent
of
the
united
states
citizen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
child
born
to
the
marriage.
his
wife
was
--
came
here
with
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
is
otherwise
admissible
then
he
comes
within
241
(f),
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
seem
--
i
just
want
to
get
this
clear.
his
argument
is
at
the
time
he
came
he
might
have
come
as
a
quota
immigrant
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it
was
oversubscribe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
is
--
what
is
--
why
does
he
say
he
was
otherwise
admissible?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
old
was
he
you
say
when
he
came?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
that
he'd
welcome
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
get
the
certificate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
only
attended
for
about
four
months.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
wasn't
he
asked
those
question
when
he
arrived
(inaudible)
and
don't
they
ask
him,
are
you
a
communist
or
are
you
a
prostitute
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
they
ask
him
all
those
questions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
confess
those
--
those
labels
leave
easily
qualitative
and
quantitative.
does
that
all
amount
anything
more
than
that
if
there
are
personal
characteristics
which
disqualify
one
from
entry
or
make
one
excludable
from
it
that
lying
about
one
of
those
is
not
forgiven
by
the
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
--
and
to
the
quota,
system
does
not
set
up
any
personal
characteristics
as
basis
of
disqualification.
is
that
what
you
mean
by
quantitative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
if
you
lie
about
some
personal
characteristics,
that
is
one's
belief
or
one's
condition
of
health
or
whether
one
is
a
prostitute
or
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
say
but
why
is
that
excused
if
lying
about
something
which
merely
got
you
a
better
place
or
a
preferential
position
to
come
in
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
say
no
one's
making
clear
to
me
what
this
distinction
of
those
labels
quantitative
and
qualitative
suppose
to
mean.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
a
communist?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
not
have
tuberculosis
or
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
actually
if
one
is
a
skilled
mechanic,
one
man
has
a
preference
on
entrance.
it's
not
a
disqualification
on
the
contrary
if
a
characteristic
which
assures
your
entry
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
wish
you
forget
those
labels
if
i
can
follow
you
easily
if
you
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
not
going
to
use
qualitative.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
this
come
down
to
this
mr.
solicitor
general,
your
argument
as
i
understand
on
the
other
side
is,
if
you
lie
about
something
as
having
a
characteristic
which
is
something
we
desire
and
you
in
fact
don't
have
it,
the
statute
excuses
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
you
lie
about
something
which
is
as
to
the
characteristic
which
we
don't
want
you
to
have
then
the
statute
doesn't
excuse
it.
that
is
if
you
lie
about
being
a
communist,
if
you
lie
about
being
a
prostitute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
you
say
--
is
that
what
the
other
side
says?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
not
the
qualitative
or
quantitative
role.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
--
i
gather
does
that
mean
or
not
and
that
persons
presented
are
those
characteristics
are
disqualified
from
entry
or
excludable
from
entry
or
whatever?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
they
allow,
whichever?
they
are
characteristics
that
we
think
the
congress
has
thought
so
undesirable
that
people
posses
of
them
shall
not
be
admitted
to
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
you
are
talking
about
--
what
we're
talking
about
the
former
who
are
characteristics
that
congress
thought
so
desirable
that
we
wanted
people
like
that
to
come
into
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
because
you
are
an
american
citizen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
congressional
determination,
we
want
people
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
it
takes
years
that
your
client
went
through
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
makes
it
--
it
was
in
fact
a
marriage
but
it
was
only
for
the
purpose
of
qualifying
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
father
(inaudible),
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general
how
long
--
how
does
the
quota
system
operate?
for
how
many
years
they
had
--
do
they
fill
quotas?q
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
past.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
they
--
how
do
they
accuse
the
first
come,
first
served?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
any
year,
--
so
the
--
when
you
say
that
he's
ineligible
because
the
quota
is
over
subscribed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
for
that
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
you're
on
--
if
you're
in
the
quota
for
one
year,
can
you
come
any
time
during
that
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
--
you
wait
for
your
number
to
come
up
during
the
year
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
say
i'm
on
the
quota.(voice
overlap)
say
i'm
in
the
quota,
that
i'm
listed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
waiting
for
my
number
to
come
up.
but
it
might
not
come
up
for
100
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
then
i
lie
about
my
--
then
i
go
through
a
phony
marriage
with
an
american
citizen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
have
a
child
over
here
and
then
illegitimate
child.
i
can
stay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
section
7
will
accept
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
send
them
to
wait
for
his
number?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
so
don't
send
him
back
and
wait
for
his
number
to
ever
come
up
and
yet
if
he
did
--
and
yet
his
brother
who
did
not
have
a
number
you
send
him
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
wait
a
minute,
you're
saying
that
he's
deportable
here
because
he
wasn't
otherwise
admissible
and
he
wasn't
otherwise
admissible
because
he
--
because
the
quota
was
oversubscribed
and
he
wasn't
honored?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
wasn't
entered,
he
didn't
have
a
number.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
my
example
if
i
got
a
number
even
if
i
wont
be
here
for
a
hundred
years.
i
can
stay
although
my
brother
who
doesn't
have
a
number
i
will
send
him
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sure
i
assume
both
cases
the
applicant
has
lied
and
one
of
them
goes
home
and
the
other
one
doesn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
isn't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
gets
her
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you'd
have
to
wait
for
another
10
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
might
get
a
preferential
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
does
this
mean
then
you
send
her
back
and
she
comes
right
back
to
the
same
shift?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
that
she
doesn't
do
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
position
is
sustained
here
and
you
send
her
back.
does
she
just
turn
her
back
again?
i
guess
she
come
back
by
plane
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
there's
no
quota
why
wouldn't
she?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
i
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
interest
but
she
just
applied
for
suspension,
get
it
and
meanwhile
processed
that
application,
come
in
with
quota
or
not
quota
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
she
wouldn't
have
to
leave.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
she
then
go
back
and
start
over
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
she
has
to
go
to
jamaica
or
could
she
go
to
canada?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
take
any
longer
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
you
pointed
out
in
page
34
or
36
of
your
brief
in
the
last
case,
there
are
many
situations
in
which
this
statute
would
have
application.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
like
to
be
fair
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
gather
jamaica
was
–had
a
quota
but
is
part
of
the
british?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now,
was
it
that
certain,
was
that
oversubscribed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
see
it.
it
had
a
--
as
part
of
the
british
empire
it
had
an
independent
quota
of
100.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
oversubscribed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
there's
no
quota?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
case
was
in
process
when
this
law
was
changed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
this
case
often
close
to
most
witness?
but
certainly,
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
case
of
controversy
is
left
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
this
going
to
be
settled
on
the
errico
case?
i
am
just
wondering
why
we
have
to
go
citing
this
one
under
the
circumstance,
he
is
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
just
have
to
stick
to
this
case
mr.
solicitor
general
because
otherwise
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
conflict.
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
certiorari
granted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
has
all
of
these
been
changed
by
each
provisions
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
was
just
wondering
how
big
a
problem
is
this
in
number
any
idea?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
he
(inaudible)
re-enter
under
the
(inaudible)
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let's
see
he
is
the
parent
of
the
united
states
citizen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
child
born
to
the
marriage.
his
wife
was
--
came
here
with
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
is
otherwise
admissible
then
he
comes
within
241
(f),
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
seem
--
i
just
want
to
get
this
clear.
his
argument
is
at
the
time
he
came
he
might
have
come
as
a
quota
immigrant
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it
was
oversubscribe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
is
--
what
is
--
why
does
he
say
he
was
otherwise
admissible?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
old
was
he
you
say
when
he
came?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
that
he'd
welcome
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
get
the
certificate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
only
attended
for
about
four
months.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
wasn't
he
asked
those
question
when
he
arrived
(inaudible)
and
don't
they
ask
him,
are
you
a
communist
or
are
you
a
prostitute
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
they
ask
him
all
those
questions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
confess
those
--
those
labels
leave
easily
qualitative
and
quantitative.
does
that
all
amount
anything
more
than
that
if
there
are
personal
characteristics
which
disqualify
one
from
entry
or
make
one
excludable
from
it
that
lying
about
one
of
those
is
not
forgiven
by
the
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
--
and
to
the
quota,
system
does
not
set
up
any
personal
characteristics
as
basis
of
disqualification.
is
that
what
you
mean
by
quantitative?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
(voice

--
if
you
lie
about
some
personal
characteristics,
that
is
one's
belief
or
one's
condition
of
health
or
whether
one
is
a
prostitute
or
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
say
but
why
is
that
excused
if
lying
about
something
which
merely
got
you
a
better
place
or
a
preferential
position
to
come
in
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
say
no
one's
making
clear
to
me
what
this
distinction
of
those
labels
quantitative
and
qualitative
suppose
to
mean.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
a
communist?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
not
have
tuberculosis
or
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
actually
if
one
is
a
skilled
mechanic,
one
man
has
a
preference
on
entrance.
it's
not
a
disqualification
on
the
contrary
if
a
characteristic
which
assures
your
entry
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
wish
you
forget
those
labels
if
i
can
follow
you
easily
if
you
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we're
not
going
to
use
qualitative.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
this
come
down
to
this
mr.
solicitor
general,
your
argument
as
i
understand
on
the
other
side
is,
if
you
lie
about
something
as
having
a
characteristic
which
is
something
we
desire
and
you
in
fact
don't
have
it,
the
statute
excuses
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
you
lie
about
something
which
is
as
to
the
characteristic
which
we
don't
want
you
to
have
then
the
statute
doesn't
excuse
it.
that
is
if
you
lie
about
being
a
communist,
if
you
lie
about
being
a
prostitute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
you
say
--
is
that
what
the
other
side
says?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
not
the
qualitative
or
quantitative
role.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
say
--
i
gather
does
that
mean
or
not
and
that
persons
presented
are
those
characteristics
are
disqualified
from
entry
or
excludable
from
entry
or
whatever?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
they
allow,
whichever?
they
are
characteristics
that
we
think
the
congress
has
thought
so
undesirable
that
people
posses
of
them
shall
not
be
admitted
to
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
you
are
talking
about
--
what
we're
talking
about
the
former
who
are
characteristics
that
congress
thought
so
desirable
that
we
wanted
people
like
that
to
come
into
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
because
you
are
an
american
citizen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
congressional
determination,
we
want
people
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
it
takes
years
that
your
client
went
through
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
makes
it
--
it
was
in
fact
a
marriage
but
it
was
only
for
the
purpose
of
qualifying
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
father
(inaudible),
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general
how
long
--
how
does
the
quota
system
operate?
for
how
many
years
they
had
--
do
they
fill
quotas?q
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
past.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
they
--
how
do
they
accuse
the
first
come,
first
served?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
in
any
year,
--
so
the
--
when
you
say
that
he's
ineligible
because
the
quota
is
over
subscribed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
for
that
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
you're
on
--
if
you're
in
the
quota
for
one
year,
can
you
come
any
time
during
that
year?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
that
--
you
wait
for
your
number
to
come
up
during
the
year
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
say
i'm
on
the
quota.(voice
overlap)
say
i'm
in
the
quota,
that
i'm
listed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
waiting
for
my
number
to
come
up.
but
it
might
not
come
up
for
100
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
then
i
lie
about
my
--
then
i
go
through
a
phony
marriage
with
an
american
citizen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
have
a
child
over
here
and
then
illegitimate
child.
i
can
stay?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
section
7
will
accept
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
send
them
to
wait
for
his
number?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
so
don't
send
him
back
and
wait
for
his
number
to
ever
come
up
and
yet
if
he
did
--
and
yet
his
brother
who
did
not
have
a
number
you
send
him
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
wait
a
minute,
you're
saying
that
he's
deportable
here
because
he
wasn't
otherwise
admissible
and
he
wasn't
otherwise
admissible
because
he
--
because
the
quota
was
oversubscribed
and
he
wasn't
honored?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
wasn't
entered,
he
didn't
have
a
number.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
my
example
if
i
got
a
number
even
if
i
wont
be
here
for
a
hundred
years.
i
can
stay
although
my
brother
who
doesn't
have
a
number
i
will
send
him
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sure
i
assume
both
cases
the
applicant
has
lied
and
one
of
them
goes
home
and
the
other
one
doesn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
isn't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
gets
her
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you'd
have
to
wait
for
another
10
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
might
get
a
preferential
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
does
this
mean
then
you
send
her
back
and
she
comes
right
back
to
the
same
shift?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
that
she
doesn't
do
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
position
is
sustained
here
and
you
send
her
back.
does
she
just
turn
her
back
again?
i
guess
she
come
back
by
plane
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
there's
no
quota
why
wouldn't
she?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
i
just
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
interest
but
she
just
applied
for
suspension,
get
it
and
meanwhile
processed
that
application,
come
in
with
quota
or
not
quota
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
she
wouldn't
have
to
leave.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
she
then
go
back
and
start
over
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
she
has
to
go
to
jamaica
or
could
she
go
to
canada?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
take
any
longer
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
you
pointed
out
in
page
34
or
36
of
your
brief
in
the
last
case,
there
are
many
situations
in
which
this
statute
would
have
application.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
like
to
be
fair
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
gather
jamaica
was
–had
a
quota
but
is
part
of
the
british?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now,
was
it
that
certain,
was
that
oversubscribed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
see
it.
it
had
a
--
as
part
of
the
british
empire
it
had
an
independent
quota
of
100.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
oversubscribed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
there's
no
quota?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
case
was
in
process
when
this
law
was
changed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
this
case
often
close
to
most
witness?
but
certainly,
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
case
of
controversy
is
left
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
is
this
going
to
be
settled
on
the
errico
case?
i
am
just
wondering
why
we
have
to
go
citing
this
one
under
the
circumstance,
he
is
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
just
have
to
stick
to
this
case
mr.
solicitor
general
because
otherwise
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
conflict.
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
certiorari
granted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
it
is.
