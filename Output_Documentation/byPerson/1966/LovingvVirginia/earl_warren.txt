mr.

chief

your
motion
is
granted.
mr.
hirschkop,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
states
for
the
first
time
in
that
--
in
the
20s
passed
these
kinds
of
laws,
do
you
recall?
chief

earl

but
you
were
saying
that
the
western
states
and
the
eastern
states
and
others
during
the
1924
period
passed
these
laws
as
i
understood
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
what
relevance
do
that
1924
period
have
to
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
order
--
have
you
agreed
upon
an
order
or
--
or
i
would
think
mr.
marutani
would
probably
be
next?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
that
would
be
the
normal
way.
mr.
marutani,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wouldn't
you
--
wouldn't
you
concede
mr.
marutani
that
if
the
law
provided
that
the
other
races
so-called
must
not
intermarry
that
the
law
would
be
good?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
the
reason
i
ask
it
was
because
there
were
some
and
had
mentioned
what
you
have
said
that
--
that
they
were
denied
equal
protection
in
that
there
was
not
the
same
prohibition
against
intermarrying
of
the
so-called
races.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcilwaine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
falls
on
the
question
of
equal
protection,
maybe
your
--
your
section
which
allows
anyone
with
one-sixteenth
or
less
of
indian
blood
to
--
to
intermarry
with
the
--
with
whites
would
have
some
significance,
would
it
not
where
--
where
that
this
one
says,
anyone
who
has
got
a
colored
blood
in
them
cannot
marry
with
the
white.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
do
put
a
restrictions
on
north
american-indians
if
they
have
more
than
one-sixteenth
of
indian
blood
in
them,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
no
indians
in
virginia?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
get
that
from
the
debates
on
the
fourteenth
amendment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
did
you
--
where
did
you
quote
that
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
a
little
different
though,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcilwaine,
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
are
people
who
have
the
same
--
same
feeling
about
and
interreligious
marriages,
but
because
that
maybe
true,
would
you
think
that
the
state
could
prohibit
people
from
having
interreligious
marriages?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
--
because
you
believe
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
wrote
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
mr.
gordon
take
the
position
that
there
is
a
basic
difference
in
the
intelligence
in
the
races?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
what
you
thought
of
the
findings
of
this
great
committee
of
unesco
where
--
where
about
20
of
greatest
anthropologists
in
the
world
joined
unanimously
in
making
some
very
cogent
findings
on
--
on
the
races.
do
you
agree
with
that
or
is
it
--
your
position
consistent
with
what
is
said
by
this
group?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
hardly
think
that
--
i
hardly
think
that
the
whole
scientific
community
would
agree
with
mr.
gordon
either,
would
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
last
paragraph
of
unesco's
report
is
rather
definite.
it
isn't
general
in
any
sense.
it
said,
"the
biological
data
given
above
stand
an
open
contradiction
to
the
tenets
of
racism.
racist's
theories
can
in
no
way
pretend
to
have
any
scientific
foundation
and
the
anthropologist
should
endeavor
to
prevent
the
results
of
their
researches
from
being
used
in
such
a
bias
way
that
they
would
serve
nonscientific
ends
that
rather
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
a
definite
finding
it
seems
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
want
to
know
mr.
mcilwaine
if
it
does
work
equally
as
against
both.
now,
as
counsel
pointed
out,
it
--
it
prevents
--
it
keeps
the
white
race
as
you
--
you
would
say
pure
but
it
doesn't
keep
the
other
racists
that
way.
you
don't
--
you
don't
have
any
prohibition
against
the
negro
marrying
a
malay
or
a
mongolian.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
if
it's
to
--
if
it
is
to
preserve
the
purity
of
the
racists,
why
aren't
they
and
as
much
entitled
to
have
purity
of
their
racists
protected
as
a
white
race?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
--
what
prohibits
it
under
virginia
law?
what
prohibits
the
--
a
negro
from
marrying
an
indian?
what
prevents
a
negro
from
marrying
a
japanese
or
a
malay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
understood
from
the
brief
of
mr.
marutani
that
there
are
1750
japanese
in
virginia
according
to
the
last
census.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
we
--
do
we
deny
for
protection
to
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
what
i'm
concerned
with.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
principle
because
there
are
only
a
few
people
of
one
race
in
virginia
that
virginia
can
say
they
have
no
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
they
have
the
same
rights
as
the
other
--
other
race,
the
white
race
to
keep
their
race
pure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
they
have
--
they've
got
enough
of
them,
is
that
all
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
a
lot
of
indians
in
the
south,
aren't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
man
says
they're
lot.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
that
either
of
this
happened
to
be
one
of
the
1750
japanese
who
are
in
the
state
and
you
have
a
law
of
that
kind,
we
would
deal
with
–
we
would
somewhat
to
mean,
would
we
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
probably
against
japanese
marrying
whites.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said
counsel
to
think
it
was
rather
open
question
as
to
whether
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
your
statute
require
--
apply
only
the
colored
people,
negroes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
about
colored?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
it
does
--
it
does
apply,
doesn't
it,
to
american-indians
if
they
--
if
anyone
has
more
of
the
one-sixteenth
indian
blood
in
them,
it
applies
to
him,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
that's
the
same
--
same
body
of
law
on
this
area,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
ever
declared
it
to
be
unconstitutional
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
invalid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
felony,
as
a
felony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
though
you
had
a
general
statutes
that
says
every
--
every
marriage
between
colored
person
and
a
white
was
void
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
without
the
necessity
of
divorce
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
any
other
judicial
decree.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
that
they
would
be
--
that
they
would
be
living
in
adultery,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
earlier
in
your
argument
that
if
--
if
the
state
of
virginia
had
--
had
shown
a
strong
of
interest
as
they've
shown
in
this
case
to
preserve
purity
the
races
that
they
probably
would
not
recognized
the
marriage
of
another
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
thought
you've
got
a
statute
which
said
that
--
that
cohabitation
between
whites
or
between
negroes
was
only
a
misdemeanor
but
that
it
said
it
was
between
white
and
negro,
it
was
a
felony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
assuming
mr.
--
mr.
mcilwaine
that
is
correct
in
the
scientific
findings,
is
there
quite
any
of
those
things
to
the
rights
of
people
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
of
the
laws?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
does
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
argues
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
legal
writer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
happened
to
be
the
same
16
states
that
had
school
segregation
laws,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

16
are
not
among
those
that
had
segregation
laws.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
those
16
that
--
i've
been
--
i've
just
been
looking
at
the
list
and
i
--
i
can't
see
single
one
of
these
states
that
wasn't
among
those
that
had
miscegenation
or
had
the
school
segregation
laws.
you
may
find
one
but
i
like

(voice

chief

but
they
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcilwaine,
didn't
--
didn't
we
in
the
segregation
cases
have
also
argued
to
us
what
was
supposed
to
be
scientific
evidence
to
the
--
to
the
effect
the
whites
would
be
injured
by
having
to
go
to
school
with
the

with
the

chief

isn't
that

isn't
the

argument
you're
making
here?
chief

chief

you're

that's
all
what
i'm
concerned
with.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
principle
because
there
are
only
a
few
people
of
one
race
in
virginia
that
virginia
can
say
they
have
no
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

they
have
the
same
rights
as
the
other
--
other
race,
the
white
race
to
keep
their
race
pure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
(voice

chief
justice
earl
warren
because
they
have
--
they've
got
enough
of
them,
is
that
all
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
a
lot
of
indians
in
the
south,
aren't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
man
says
they're
lot.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
that
either
of
this
happened
to
be
one
of
the
1750
japanese
who
are
in
the
state
and
you
have
a
law
of
that
kind,
we
would
deal
with
–
we
would
somewhat
to
mean,
would
we
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
probably
against
japanese
marrying
whites.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said
counsel
to
think
it
was
rather
open
question
as
to
whether
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
your
statute
require
--
apply
only
the
colored
people,
negroes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
about
colored?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
it
does
--
it
does
apply,
doesn't
it,
to
american-indians
if
they
--
if
anyone
has
more
of
the
one-sixteenth
indian
blood
in
them,
it
applies
to
him,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
that's
the
same
--
same
body
of
law
on
this
area,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
ever
declared
it
to
be
unconstitutional
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
invalid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
felony,
as
a
felony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
though
you
had
a
general
statutes
that
says
every
--
every
marriage
between
colored
person
and
a
white
was
void
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
without
the
necessity
of
divorce
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
any
other
judicial
decree.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
that
they
would
be
--
that
they
would
be
living
in
adultery,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
earlier
in
your
argument
that
if
--
if
the
state
of
virginia
had
--
had
shown
a
strong
of
interest
as
they've
shown
in
this
case
to
preserve
purity
the
races
that
they
probably
would
not
recognized
the
marriage
of
another
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
thought
you've
got
a
statute
which
said
that
--
that
cohabitation
between
whites
or
between
negroes
was
only
a
misdemeanor
but
that
it
said
it
was
between
white
and
negro,
it
was
a
felony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
assuming
mr.
--
mr.
mcilwaine
that
is
correct
in
the
scientific
findings,
is
there
quite
any
of
those
things
to
the
rights
of
people
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
of
the
laws?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
does
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
argues
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
he
legal
writer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
happened
to
be
the
same
16
states
that
had
school
segregation
laws,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

16
are
not
among
those
that
had
segregation
laws.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
talking
about
those
16
that
--
i've
been
--
i've
just
been
looking
at
the
list
and
i
--
i
can't
see
single
one
of
these
states
that
wasn't
among
those
that
had
miscegenation
or
had
the
school
segregation
laws.
you
may
find
one
but
i
like

(voice

--

mr.
mcilwaine,
didn't
--
didn't
we
in
the
segregation
cases
have
also
argued
to
us
what
was
supposed
to
be
scientific
evidence
to
the
--
to
the
effect
the
whites
would
be
injured
by
having
to
go
to
school
with
the

with
the
negroes?
chief
justice
earl

isn't
that
--
isn't
the
same
argument
you're
making
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
almost
in
the
same
dilemma
yourself,
aren't
you,
according
the
virginia

history
of
virginia

but
finding
