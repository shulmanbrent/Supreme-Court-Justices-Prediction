mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
case
which
arises
out
of
a
judicial
inquiry
established
by
the
appellate
division,
second
department
state
of
new
york
to
reach
this
court.
the
first
anonymous
v.
baker
to
sustain
by
a
narrow
majority,
the
validity
of
the
procedures
followed
by
that
inquiry
against
the
claim
that
where
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
second
was
cohen
against
hurley,
in
which
by
the
same
majority
do
upheld
the
disbarment
of
a
lawyer
who
withheld
by
the
majority
in
that
case
to
have
pleaded
only
his
state
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
that
case
also
was
decided
before
new
york
and
the
other
state
were
required
to
give
recognition
to
the
fifth
amendment.
that
requirement
being
imposed
by
your
decision
in
the
malloy
against
hogan
and
for
reasons
which
are
set
forth
with
greater
detail
in
our
brief,
we
feel
that
for
these
reasons,
the
decisions
in
cohen
against
hurley
is
certainly
not
controlling
and
indeed
hardly
enough
competitive
here.
this
case,
it
does
present
the
question
squarely
of
what
construction
must
be
given
to
the
word
compel
in
the
fifth
amendment.
the
petitioner
here
was
admitted
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
1926.
he
practice
without
criticism
or
approach
until
june
of
1959
when
he
was
served
with
a
subpoena
commanding
him
to
appear
before
this
judicial
inquiry.
the
subpoena
indicated
that
he
would
be
required
to
testify
with
respect
to
matters
pertaining
to
its
businesses
and
attorney
and
it
also
requested
that
he
produced
a
large
number
records
all
of
which
were
designated
in
12
separate
very
broad
categories
and
indeed
a
catch-all
phrase
which
said
that
he
was
required
to
produce
all
other
deeds,
evidences
and
writings
which
you
have
in
your
custody
or
power
concerning
the
premises.
insofar
as
it
appears,
there
were
no
charges
against
him
and
respondent's
brief
indicates
that
the
reason
that
he
was
called
was
because
he
had
filed
a
large
number
of
what
are
known
the
statements
of
retainer.
these
are
statements
which
are
required
to
be
filed
with
the
appellate
division
by
attorneys
who
have
more
than
a
certain
number;
i
believe
that's
five
cases
in
a
given
year
in
which
their
compensation
is
on
a
contingent
basis.
and
he
had
well
in
excess
of
the
required
number
and
had
filed
a
statement.
he
appeared
before
the
inquiry.
he
moved
to
quash
the
subpoena.
this
motion
was
denied,
appeals
were
taken
and
the
denial
was
upheld.
he
then
interposed
a
claim
of
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
as
made
--
well,
he
claims
the
privilege
under
the
state
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
well.
and
it
was
made
claim
to
him
at
the
time
he
first
claimed
the
privilege
that
it
was
available.
it
was
--
there
was
stated
unequivocally
by
the
presiding
justice
that
he
have
an
absolute
right
to
claim
the
privilege.
he
was
informed
that
there
was
a
test
case
pending
that
was
cohen
against
hurley
and
that
would
be
appropriate
to
recess
the
hearing
until
the
determination
of
that
case
and
this
was
done
and
the
rather
lengthy
recess
ensued.
subsequently,
after
the
decision
in
cohen
against
hurley,
he
was
again
requested
to
appear
after
some
vacillation
he
did
reinstitute
his
claim
that
quite
unequivocally
and
in
connection
with
that,
it
was
made
claim
to
him
that
while
he
had
a
right
to
claim
the
privilege,
the
consequences
might
be
very
serious.
indeed
that
the
consequences
might
be
disbarment.
irrelevant
portions
to
which
i
refer
are
pages
44
and
45
of
the
record.
the
counsel
for
the
inquiry
quoted
from
the
cohen
decision.
i
pointed
that
it
was
to
be
urged
that
the
appellate
division
--
to
the
appellate
division
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
same
kind
of
failure
to
cooperate
with
the
court
which
were
the
basis
for
the
disbarment
of
cohen.
nevertheless,
he
adhered
to
his
determination
with
his
decision
not
to
respond
or
to
read
--
or
to
produce
these
records
and
subsequently,
the
appellate
division
ordered
respondent
to
institute
proceedings
which
are
procedure
filed
in
new
york
for
disbarment.
the
proceedings
were
held
a
rather
full
account
of
the
proceedings
before
the
judicial
inquiry
can
be
found
in
the
referee's
report
that
which
is
at
pages
56
to
81
of
the
record.
these
proceedings
are
held
before
a
referee.
there
was
an
petition
to
the
appellate
division
to
confirm
the
order
of
the
referee
and
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
is
found
at
record
83.
essentially,
the
appellate
division
held
once
again,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
but
that
in
doing
so,
he
had
failed
to
observe
his
obligation
to
be
candid,
to
be
frank,
to
be
cooperative
with
the
court
in
which
his
failure
to
conform
with
that
duty
which
was
the
basis
for
the
other
of
disbarment.
the
appeal
was
taken
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
we
assert
of
course
that
it's
only
on
the
basis
of
such
inference
that
this
could
be
done.
but
the
appellate
division
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
the
appellate
division
disclaimed
any
inference
of
wrongdoing.
the
court
of
appeals
to
which
an
appeal
was
taken
affirmed
summarily
with
a
very
brief
memorandum
of
opinion
which
i
think
i
might
read
it
said
simply
or
to
affirm
now
the
authority
of
cohen
against
hurley
366
u.s.
and
on
the
further
ground
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
does
not
apply
to
a
demand,
not
for
oral
testimony
but
that
an
attorney
produce
records
required
by
law
to
be
kept
with
him
--
by
him,
boyd
and
davis,
and
shapiro
against
the
united
states
which
is
of
course
the
relevant
decision.
to
return
to
the
irrational
of
the
appellate
division,
a
--
it
assert
quite
plainly
that
no
inference
of
wrongdoing
of
any
kind
was
being
drawn
from
his
assertion
of
privilege.
the
appellate
division
said
that
when
he
appeared
before
the
inquiry
and
i
quote
its
words,
he
had
an
absolute
right
to
invoke
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
in
other
words,
the
right
or
privilege
not
to
testify
but
that
he
also
have
a
common
law
right,
possibly
a
statutory
right.
there
is
a
provision
of
new
york
law
which
regulates
the
practice
of
law
by
attorneys.
but
he
also
had
this
common
law
duty
to
testify
and
that
the
duty
to
testify
can
be
separated
and
viewed
entirely
apart
from
the
right
not
to
testify.
now,
the
fist
question
is
whether
this
is
simply
playing
his
words
as
we
asserted
this
or
whether
this
is
in
fact
a
fair
and
meaningful
way
of
looking
at
this
matter.
the
question
is
most
important
because
if
the
appellate
division
in
the
new
york
courts
are
correct.
then
this
really
contend
a
very
simple
case.
there's
no
problem
at
all.
they
admit
that
no
penalty,
no
sanction
is
being
imposed
by
reason
of
the
invitation
of
the
privilege.
indeed
they
say
if
--
it
is
not
even
being
impaired
or
diminished
in
any
way.
they
say
they
are
focusing
on
this
obligation
to
cooperate.
his
duty
to
testify
and
it
is
unrelated
to
his
right
not
to
testify.”
i
think
it
can
be
demonstrated
quite
easily
and
readily
that
there
can
no
separation
of
these
two
opposite
sides
of
the
same
coin
and
that's
best
on
by
considering
what
would
be
the
result
if
his
refusal
to
testify
had
been
placed
upon
the
attorney-client
privilege.
here,
i
think,
everyone
respondent
to
new
york
courts
would
all
agree
that
he
could
not
be
disbarred
for
failure
to
cooperate
with
the
new
york
courts
by
failing
to
be
candid,
by
failing
to
be
frank
with
them.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
that's
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice
fortas.
it
is
not
his
privilege
but
the
point
is
that
you
must
examine
the
reason
for
his
refusal
to
be
cooperative.
the
question
of
what
that
reason
is,
i'm
putting
aside
for
the
moment.
the
only
question
i'm
directing
myself
to
is
must
you
examine
the
reasons.
can
you
avoid
looking
entirely
at
the
reason?
now,
the
appellate
division
has
said,
yes,
we
can
avoid
looking
at
the
reason.
and
all
i'm
asserting
now
is
that
they
cannot
do
so.
if
they
could
avoid
looking
at
the
reason,
they
could
have
avoided
just
as
well
at
its
privilege
had
been
the
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes,
that
is
quite
right.
he
has
an
excellent
satisfactory
reason
for
his
failure
to
be
cooperative
for
his
failure
to
be
frank
with
the
court.
the
failure
is
exactly
the
same
but
you
excuse
it
in
that
case
because
he
has
no
privilege
whatever.
he
has
no
basis
for
refusing
to
answer.
but
you
examine
the
question
of
whether
he
has
a
basis
or
no
basis
for
refusing
to
answer
in
reaching
your
conclusion.
and
this
is
what
i
say
must
be
done
here.
in
examining
the
question
of
whether
he
is
guilty
of
a
failure
to
cooperate
with
the
court.
you
must
examine
the
question
of
whether
he
has
an
adequate
basis
or
not.
the
question
before
the
court
is
not
whether
these
two
opposite
side
of
the
same
coin
can
be
viewed
separately
but
whether
his
failure
to
comply
with
his
obligation
to
be
cooperative
with
the
court
is
subject
to
the
claim
of
privilege
or
not
subject
to
the
claim
of
privilege.
this
is
phrase
incidentally
which
i
draw
off
in
justice
--
judge
cardozo,
then
judge
cardozo
in
the
case
of
karlin
v.
culkin
when
he
was
chief
judge
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
question
which
must
be
decided
is
his
failure
to
cooperate
subject
to
the
privilege
which
is
his
by
virtue
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
is
it
not
subject
to
a
privilege.
now,
that
question
was
not
looked
into,
not
examined
at
all
by
the
courts
of
new
york.
but
it
is
i
think
before
this
court
and
i
should
like
to
turn
to
it.
the
question
then
is,
what
are
the
possible
bases
for
concluding
as
new
york
would
like
to
conclude
that
this
duty
to
cooperate
must
prevail.
now
the
first
is
the
one
adhere
to
suggested
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
that
is
i
suppose
it
could
be
held
that
in
the
proceedings
such
as
this.
an
inference
of
guilt
or
of
misconduct
might
be
drawn,
though
you
cannot
under
the
griffin
case
draw
such
an
inference
in
other
proceedings.
this
i
must
say
would
go
into
conduct
to
virtually
every
decision
of
this
court.
if
there's
one
thing
that's
clear,
if
there's
one
thing
that
has
no
division
within
the
court
about
it
is
that
the
no
improper
inference
of
guilt
and
misconduct
of
any
kind
may
be
drawn
from
the
invocation
in
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
this
is
the
(inaudible)
decision
in
grinwold
and
griffin.
so
i
think
this
manner
of
saying
that
the
duty
to
cooperate
with
the
courts
which
regulate
the
practice
of
law
must
be
set
aside.
the
second
possibility
would
be
to
engage
in
analysis
of
the
comparative
value
of
a
--
the
comparative
importance
the
way
to
be
given
to
the
need
to
cooperate
with
the
court
as
against
the
policies.
the
importance
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
here
again,
i
think
we
run
into
a
consistent
line
of
decisions
of
this
court.
so
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
had
been
interpreted
date,
it's
been
uniformly
held
that
this
kind
of
process
is
not
engaged
in.
whatever
the
fifth
amendment
mean,
it
means
and
it's
not
to
be
abridged
by
virtue
of
what
is
considered
to
be
a
greater
objective
of
the
state.
the
objective
of
punishing
persons
who
are
thought
possibly
guilty
of
murder
or
other
serious
crime
is
certainly
as
important
to
one
as
we
know.
but
it
does
not
prevail
against
the
fifth
amendment
and
so
i
think
that
some
sort
of
waned
process
to
determine
the
relative
value
of
these
two
again
must
be
set
aside.
i
may
say
in
passing
that
even
in
such
process
where
to
be
engaged
in.
it
would
not
be
on
the
basis
of
simply
determination
of
which
would
they
considered
to
more
valuable.
the
test
would
have
to
be
one
of
necessity
rather
than
reasonable
relationship.
the
same
test
which
has
been
applied
in
shelton
v.
tucker,
mclaughlin
against
florida
and
a
host
of
other
cases
that
wherever
a
regulatory
function
has
the
tendency
to
impair
a
significant
constitutional
right.
a
much
sterner
test
has
been
applied
by
this
court
and
i
presume
will
continue
to
be
applied
by
this
court.
we
then
come
to
the
only
other
two
bases
that
i
can
see
for
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
duty
to
cooperate
must
prevail
over
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
that
would
be
to
construe
the
fifth
amendment
narrowly
so
as
to
make
it
not
apply
in
this
situation
at
all
or
to
employ
some
sort
of
waiver
approach.
now,
i
mention
the
two
of
these
together
because
the
arguments
which
are
used
for
each
of
these
possible
bases
for
narrowing
the
protection
of
the
privilege
tend
to
be
the
same.
in
each
case,
the
same
starting
place
is
to
consider
the
role
of
the
lawyer
in
our
society.
it's
pointed
out
that
the
lawyers
are
engaged
in
the
administration
of
justice
that
there
were
no
public
service,
that
they
operate
on
the
high
ethical
standards
which
are
greater
than
those
normally
applied,
normally
demanded
of
other
professions.
now,
of
course
we
agree
fully
that
membership
in
the
bar
carries
with
it
proud
obligations
that
are
not
imposed
upon
other
occupations
nor
a
profession
say
if
the
duty
to
represent
indigents
for
example,
without
compensation
to
the
court
in
line,
limitations
upon
what
we
may
properly
do
in
advance
and
the
interest
of
our
clients
is
another.
i
think
however
that
as
lawyers
and
as
judges,
we
have
to
guard
against
being
taking
too
parochial
view
and
guard
also
against
being
swept
away
by
this
rhetoric.
the
--
there's
no
question
that
the
state
as
a
result
of
the
special
law
of
the
attorney
may
regulate
the
practice
of
law
very
closely
indeed
but
there
is
a
second
more
important
question
here
and
that
is
whether
there's
a
constitutional
difference
between
the
authority
to
regulate
the
bar
and
the
authority
to
regulate
any
other
profession.
and
try
as
i
may
--
i
don't
think
i
can
find
one.
there
are
countless
other
oblig
--
other
occupations
that
maybe
and
are
being
regulated
by
the
state
and
while
they
don't
avow
the
administration
of
justice,
they
all
relate
in
some
very
significant
way
to
public
health
to
the
public
safety.
at
least
they
involved
some
legitimate
concern
of
a
state.
and
i
see
no
way
in
which
one
could
not
find
a
rational
basis,
a
rational
reasons
for
a
legislator
to
conclude
that
if
it
is
regulating
a
particular
occupation
that
it
would
be
more
effective,
more
efficient,
if
it
could
demand
the
persons
who
are
engaged
in
that
occupation
that
they
respond
to
certain
questions
relating
to
the
manner
in
which
that
business
is
carried
out.
you
always
in
every
instance
in
which
there
is
regulatory
activity
being
carried
on
be
able
to
construct
a
sound
reasonable
argument
of
this
kind.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
i
certainly
hope
too,
because
i
think
that
the
argument
i
make
in
here
affect
the
shapiro
point
as
well.
i
simply
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
area
that
i'm
discussing
would
not
involved
merely
occupation
subject
to
regulation
but
the
very
vast
area
dealing
with
the
use
of
public
resources,
dealing
with
the
use
of
benefits
of
one
kind
or
another
that
the
government
provide
to
its
citizens.
i'm
talking
about
such
things
as
at
lease
of
government
land
that
received
the
proper
support
payments
more
of
its
insurance,
the
use
of
public
airports.
in
all
of
this
area,
it
is
always
possible
to
construct
a
rational
argument
for
showing
that
the
program
can
be
administered
more
efficiently.
if
the
recipients
of
these
benefits
where
to
respond
to
questions
about
how
the
benefits
are
to
be
used?
and
if
the
fifth
amendment
is
to
be
construed
so
that
it
no
longer
apply
in
every
instance
in
which
there
is
regulation
of
a
particular
industry.
then
this
would
represent
about
his
drastic
or
rejection
of
the
decisions
of
the
past
two
terms
as
could
be
possibly
imaginable.
now,
i
pass
over
my
discussion
of
the
weight
of
privilege
to
get
to
the
shapiro
case
because
i
think
that
what
i've
been
saying
until
now
affect
the
shapiro
doctrine
as
well.
in
that
case
to
recall
it
briefly
to
your
mind,
the
court
held
that
wherever
a
statute
or
regulation
requires
keeping
records.
those
records
which
otherwise
would
be
considered
private
which
might
had
been
kept
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
statute
are
somehow
converted
into
if
not
public
record
at
least
quasi-public
records
and
that
they're
not
protected
against
disclosure
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now,
this
holding
was
preceded
by
a
sentence
in
the
court's
opinion
which
bears
reading.
the
court
said,
“it
may
be
assumed
at
the
outset
that
there
are
limits
which
the
government
cannot
constitutionally
exceed
in
requiring
the
keeping
of
records
which
may
be
inspected
by
the
administrative
agency
and
may
be
used
in
prosecuting
statutory
violations
committed
by
the
record
keeper
himself.
but
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
“no
serious
misgiving
that
these
bounds
have
been
overstep
would
appear
to
be
evoked
where
there
is
--
when
there
is
a
sufficient
relations
between
the
activity
sort
to
be
regulated
and
the
public
concern.
so
that
the
government
can
constitutionally
regulate
or
forbid
the
basic
activity
concerned
and
can
constitutionally
require
the
keeping
of
a
particular
records
subject
to
inspection
by
the
administrator.
and
while
that
sentence
is
somewhat
circular,
its
breadth
is
enormous
and
particularly
in
terms
of
the
way
which
the
commerce
power
and
the
police
power
of
the
state
has
been
interpreted
today.
but
the
court
has
said,
“it's
in
every
instance
where
a
business
is
subject
to
regulation.
its
records
which
are
designated
as
required
to
be
kept
no
longer
are
entitled
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
the
face
of
the
set
of
rule
that
the
privilege
applies
to
documents
as
well
as
to
oral
testimony.
now,
this
--
the
question
really
is
how
shall
broad
an
en
route
into
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
could
have
been
rendered
by
this
court.
the
fact
is
that
there
is
a
uniform
cause
of
constitutional
adjudication
from
boyd
and
running
through
malloy
and
griffin,
and
miranda
last
term
in
which
repeatedly,
this
court
has
announced
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
to
be
given
a
broad
and
not
a
niggardly
or
grudging
interpretation.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well
i
think,
we
would
still
have
to
reverse
the
judgment
below
because
of
the,
first,
the
lack
of
clarity
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
second,
i
think
because
of
the
doctrine
of
raley
against
ohio
which
is
a
subsidiary
point
which
we
make
in
our
brief
which
i
have
not
planned
to
cover
an
argument.
so
that
there
are
the
grounds
which
i
think
would
require
reversal
on
the
decision
below.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
there
was
no
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
there
was
--
there
were
questions
put
unanswered
but
they
related
expressly
to
whether
he
would
produce
certain
designated
documents
called
for
by
the
subpoena
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
i
think
shapiro
itself
holds
and
your
other
cases
do
hold
that
the
privilege
does
apply
to
questions
which
are
related
to
documents.
that
issue
was
well
settled
and
it
is
not
to
be
reexamined
here?
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
not
involved
here.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
that
--
that's
quite
a
fair
statement
justice
fortas.
i
think
it
should
--
this
should
be
said,
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
to
the
extent
that
questions
were
put
were
upon
the
documents.
there
was
no
effort
to
go
through
this
charade
of
putting
a
great
many
questions
and
getting
answers
to
each
of
them
in
terms
of
whether
the
privilege
was
to
be
invoked
or
not.
i
think
that
the
presiding
justice
and
counsel
for
the
inquiry,
simply
wanted
to
make
a
clear
record
that
were
questions
were
put
and
he
was
called
to
the
purposes
of
testimony.
he
would
claim
his
privilege.
the
record
was
clearly
made
and
this
was
considered
satisfactory
by
all
concerned.
but
it
is
certain
true
that
the
focus
was
upon
the
records
and
i
think
there
is
substantial
basis
for
your
reaching
the
question
of
whether
shapiro
should
continue
to
be
applied?
the
fact
is
that
this
case
stands
out
as
a
glaring
excrescence
upon
the
line
of
constitutional
decisions
that
runs
from
boyd
until
the
present
time.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
no,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
affirm
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
let
me
make
direct
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
it
is
pretty
close
to
it
justice
fortas
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
now
i
think,
it's
fair
to
say
that
you
look
at
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
does
read
affirm
on
the
basis
that
cohen
against
hurley
and
on
the
further
ground
that
shapiro
applies
and
it
--
it
might
not
be
possible
to
say
that
if
the
courts,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
had
understood
and
had
recognized
that
cohen
v.
hurley
was
no
longer
a
good
law
that
the
decision
would
have
been
the
same.
but
i
must
agree
that
shapiro
is
presented
here
or
almost
presented.
i'll
put
it
that
way.
i
think
also
the
fact
that
he
was
assured
by
the
presiding
justice
that
he
had
a
privilege
with
respect
to
the
documents
at
the
time
that
these
questions
were
put
and
the
fact
that
the
appellate
division
reaffirmed
the
fact
that
he
had
a
privilege
with
respect
to
these
documents
would
bring
the
raley
against
ohio
case
into
play.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
if
--
well,
in
raley
against
ohio,
the
petitioners
there
were
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
because
of
immunity
statute.
i
think
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
he
was
told
that
he
had
a
privilege
with
respect
to
these
documents.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes.
the
cohen
and
hurley
did
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
he
was
relying
if,
your
honor
please,
upon
the
malloy
against
hogan
case.
the
cohen
against
hurley
case
made
a
quite
claim
that
there
was
no
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment
on
that
case.
but
he
was
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
right.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
that
was
to
determine
whether
the
rational
of
the
court
was
acceptable.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
no.
that
cohen
and
hurley
was
at
this
case
that
this
was
suspended
for.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh!
well,
ask
the
cohen
against
hurley.
he
was
again
assured
that
he
have
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
relating
to
these
documents.
cohen
and
hurley
didn't
touch
that
at
all.
following
your
decision
he
was
told,
“yes,
you
may
refuse
to
produce
these
documents
by
reason
of
the
privilege
which
you
enjoy
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
it
was
only
when
he
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
alternatively
that
he
did
not
have
any
privilege
at
all
with
respect
to
these
documents.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
because
of
shapiro
but
this
was
not
involved
at
all
while
the
judicial
inquiry
was
going
on
and
there's
nothing
in
the
appellate
division
opinioned
itself
that
relates
to
this.
this
came
up
only
when
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
its
decisions.
there
was
something
in
briefs
to
that
effect
i
should
add.
but
it
did
not
come
up
at
all
until
the
appellate
division
had
decided
the
case.
so
that
i
think
the
situation
is
very
comfortable
to
what
it
was
in
raley
against
ohio.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
i'm
content
to
have
you
reach
and
decide
the
shapiro
case
because
i
do
think
the
court
should
do
so.
if
i
may,
i
can't
cover
the
shapiro
case
in
the
moment
or
two
that
i
have
available.
but
i'd
like
to
point
to
one
thing
about
it.
the
statute
involved
in
shapiro
required
every
person
subject
to
this
regulation.
to
keep
and
make
available
for
examination
by
the
office
of
price
administration
records
of
the
same
kind
as
he
has
customarily
kept
relating
to
the
prices
which
he
charges
for
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables.
and
the
bases
upon
which
he
determine
maximum
prices
for
these
commodities.
i
suggest
that
if
that
statute
had
gone
on
to
say
and
every
such
person
who
fails
to
keep
such
records
or
whose
records
are
inadequate
shall
appear
before
the
administrator
upon
his
demand
and
shall
give
testimony
concerning
the
prices
which
he
charges
for
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
and
the
bases
upon
which
he
determine
maximum
prices
for
those
commodities.
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
shapiro
case
that
will
indicate
in
any
way
why
there
should
be
a
differentiation
between
the
record
portion
of
that
statute
which
i
have
hypothesized
and
the
oral
portion
of
that.
the
opinion
itself
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
i
have
made
an
argument
in
our
brief
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
--
that
the
record
keeping
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
--
i
must
say,
we
have
briefed
and
argued
this
case
under
this
assumption
that
the
power
of
the
appellate
division
to
regulate
the
practice
of
law
is
very
broad
indeed.
and
that
it
does
have
the
authority
to
require
the
keeping
of
records
of
this
time.
do
not
think
that
should
carry
with
it
automatically
the
abandonment
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
unless
you
are
prepared
to
overall
avoid
and
to
hold
that
the
documentary
matter
is
not
subject
to
the
privilege
as
oral
testimony
is.
that's
would
require
to
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
all
that
i
suggest
is
that
there's
not
a
word
in
shapiro
that
suggest
what
that
difference
might
be.
and
that
other
decision
of
this
court
such
as
albertson
make
it
plain
that
there
should
be
no
significant
difference
between
documents
and
oral
testimony.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
no.
i
--
i
do
think
that
there
was
an
intention
to
require
him
to
testify
and
to
make
a
record
to
that
effect.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes.
they're
testimonial
record.
i
think
in
fact
they're
broader
than
the
records.
he
was
required
to
keep
by
rule
5
of
the
appellate
division.
but
this
is
another
point
entirely.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
the
third
case
which
arises
out
of
a
judicial
inquiry
established
by
the
appellate
division,
second
department
state
of
new
york
to
reach
this
court.
the
first
anonymous
v.
baker
to
sustain
by
a
narrow
majority,
the
validity
of
the
procedures
followed
by
that
inquiry
against
the
claim
that
where
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
second
was
cohen
against
hurley,
in
which
by
the
same
majority
do
upheld
the
disbarment
of
a
lawyer
who
withheld
by
the
majority
in
that
case
to
have
pleaded
only
his
state
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
that
case
also
was
decided
before
new
york
and
the
other
state
were
required
to
give
recognition
to
the
fifth
amendment.
that
requirement
being
imposed
by
your
decision
in
the
malloy
against
hogan
and
for
reasons
which
are
set
forth
with
greater
detail
in
our
brief,
we
feel
that
for
these
reasons,
the
decisions
in
cohen
against
hurley
is
certainly
not
controlling
and
indeed
hardly
enough
competitive
here.
this
case,
it
does
present
the
question
squarely
of
what
construction
must
be
given
to
the
word
compel
in
the
fifth
amendment.
the
petitioner
here
was
admitted
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
1926.
he
practice
without
criticism
or
approach
until
june
of
1959
when
he
was
served
with
a
subpoena
commanding
him
to
appear
before
this
judicial
inquiry.
the
subpoena
indicated
that
he
would
be
required
to
testify
with
respect
to
matters
pertaining
to
its
businesses
and
attorney
and
it
also
requested
that
he
produced
a
large
number
records
all
of
which
were
designated
in
12
separate
very
broad
categories
and
indeed
a
catch-all
phrase
which
said
that
he
was
required
to
produce
all
other
deeds,
evidences
and
writings
which
you
have
in
your
custody
or
power
concerning
the
premises.
insofar
as
it
appears,
there
were
no
charges
against
him
and
respondent's
brief
indicates
that
the
reason
that
he
was
called
was
because
he
had
filed
a
large
number
of
what
are
known
the
statements
of
retainer.
these
are
statements
which
are
required
to
be
filed
with
the
appellate
division
by
attorneys
who
have
more
than
a
certain
number;
i
believe
that's
five
cases
in
a
given
year
in
which
their
compensation
is
on
a
contingent
basis.
and
he
had
well
in
excess
of
the
required
number
and
had
filed
a
statement.
he
appeared
before
the
inquiry.
he
moved
to
quash
the
subpoena.
this
motion
was
denied,
appeals
were
taken
and
the
denial
was
upheld.
he
then
interposed
a
claim
of
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
as
made
--
well,
he
claims
the
privilege
under
the
state
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
well.
and
it
was
made
claim
to
him
at
the
time
he
first
claimed
the
privilege
that
it
was
available.
it
was
--
there
was
stated
unequivocally
by
the
presiding
justice
that
he
have
an
absolute
right
to
claim
the
privilege.
he
was
informed
that
there
was
a
test
case
pending
that
was
cohen
against
hurley
and
that
would
be
appropriate
to
recess
the
hearing
until
the
determination
of
that
case
and
this
was
done
and
the
rather
lengthy
recess
ensued.
subsequently,
after
the
decision
in
cohen
against
hurley,
he
was
again
requested
to
appear
after
some
vacillation
he
did
reinstitute
his
claim
that
quite
unequivocally
and
in
connection
with
that,
it
was
made
claim
to
him
that
while
he
had
a
right
to
claim
the
privilege,
the
consequences
might
be
very
serious.
indeed
that
the
consequences
might
be
disbarment.
irrelevant
portions
to
which
i
refer
are
pages
44
and
45
of
the
record.
the
counsel
for
the
inquiry
quoted
from
the
cohen
decision.
i
pointed
that
it
was
to
be
urged
that
the
appellate
division
--
to
the
appellate
division
that
he
was
guilty
of
the
same
kind
of
failure
to
cooperate
with
the
court
which
were
the
basis
for
the
disbarment
of
cohen.
nevertheless,
he
adhered
to
his
determination
with
his
decision
not
to
respond
or
to
read
--
or
to
produce
these
records
and
subsequently,
the
appellate
division
ordered
respondent
to
institute
proceedings
which
are
procedure
filed
in
new
york
for
disbarment.
the
proceedings
were
held
a
rather
full
account
of
the
proceedings
before
the
judicial
inquiry
can
be
found
in
the
referee's
report
that
which
is
at
pages
56
to
81
of
the
record.
these
proceedings
are
held
before
a
referee.
there
was
an
petition
to
the
appellate
division
to
confirm
the
order
of
the
referee
and
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division
is
found
at
record
83.
essentially,
the
appellate
division
held
once
again,
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
but
that
in
doing
so,
he
had
failed
to
observe
his
obligation
to
be
candid,
to
be
frank,
to
be
cooperative
with
the
court
in
which
his
failure
to
conform
with
that
duty
which
was
the
basis
for
the
other
of
disbarment.
the
appeal
was
taken
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
we
assert
of
course
that
it's
only
on
the
basis
of
such
inference
that
this
could
be
done.
but
the
appellate
division
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
the
appellate
division
disclaimed
any
inference
of
wrongdoing.
the
court
of
appeals
to
which
an
appeal
was
taken
affirmed
summarily
with
a
very
brief
memorandum
of
opinion
which
i
think
i
might
read
it
said
simply
or
to
affirm
now
the
authority
of
cohen
against
hurley
366
u.s.
and
on
the
further
ground
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
does
not
apply
to
a
demand,
not
for
oral
testimony
but
that
an
attorney
produce
records
required
by
law
to
be
kept
with
him
--
by
him,
boyd
and
davis,
and
shapiro
against
the
united
states
which
is
of
course
the
relevant
decision.
to
return
to
the
irrational
of
the
appellate
division,
a
--
it
assert
quite
plainly
that
no
inference
of
wrongdoing
of
any
kind
was
being
drawn
from
his
assertion
of
privilege.
the
appellate
division
said
that
when
he
appeared
before
the
inquiry
and
i
quote
its
words,
he
had
an
absolute
right
to
invoke
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
in
other
words,
the
right
or
privilege
not
to
testify
but
that
he
also
have
a
common
law
right,
possibly
a
statutory
right.
there
is
a
provision
of
new
york
law
which
regulates
the
practice
of
law
by
attorneys.
but
he
also
had
this
common
law
duty
to
testify
and
that
the
duty
to
testify
can
be
separated
and
viewed
entirely
apart
from
the
right
not
to
testify.
now,
the
fist
question
is
whether
this
is
simply
playing
his
words
as
we
asserted
this
or
whether
this
is
in
fact
a
fair
and
meaningful
way
of
looking
at
this
matter.
the
question
is
most
important
because
if
the
appellate
division
in
the
new
york
courts
are
correct.
then
this
really
contend
a
very
simple
case.
there's
no
problem
at
all.
they
admit
that
no
penalty,
no
sanction
is
being
imposed
by
reason
of
the
invitation
of
the
privilege.
indeed
they
say
if
--
it
is
not
even
being
impaired
or
diminished
in
any
way.
they
say
they
are
focusing
on
this
obligation
to
cooperate.
his
duty
to
testify
and
it
is
unrelated
to
his
right
not
to
testify.”
i
think
it
can
be
demonstrated
quite
easily
and
readily
that
there
can
no
separation
of
these
two
opposite
sides
of
the
same
coin
and
that's
best
on
by
considering
what
would
be
the
result
if
his
refusal
to
testify
had
been
placed
upon
the
attorney-client
privilege.
here,
i
think,
everyone
respondent
to
new
york
courts
would
all
agree
that
he
could
not
be
disbarred
for
failure
to
cooperate
with
the
new
york
courts
by
failing
to
be
candid,
by
failing
to
be
frank
with
them.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
that's
exactly
the
point
mr.
justice
fortas.
it
is
not
his
privilege
but
the
point
is
that
you
must
examine
the
reason
for
his
refusal
to
be
cooperative.
the
question
of
what
that
reason
is,
i'm
putting
aside
for
the
moment.
the
only
question
i'm
directing
myself
to
is
must
you
examine
the
reasons.
can
you
avoid
looking
entirely
at
the
reason?
now,
the
appellate
division
has
said,
yes,
we
can
avoid
looking
at
the
reason.
and
all
i'm
asserting
now
is
that
they
cannot
do
so.
if
they
could
avoid
looking
at
the
reason,
they
could
have
avoided
just
as
well
at
its
privilege
had
been
the
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes,
that
is
quite
right.
he
has
an
excellent
satisfactory
reason
for
his
failure
to
be
cooperative
for
his
failure
to
be
frank
with
the
court.
the
failure
is
exactly
the
same
but
you
excuse
it
in
that
case
because
he
has
no
privilege
whatever.
he
has
no
basis
for
refusing
to
answer.
but
you
examine
the
question
of
whether
he
has
a
basis
or
no
basis
for
refusing
to
answer
in
reaching
your
conclusion.
and
this
is
what
i
say
must
be
done
here.
in
examining
the
question
of
whether
he
is
guilty
of
a
failure
to
cooperate
with
the
court.
you
must
examine
the
question
of
whether
he
has
an
adequate
basis
or
not.
the
question
before
the
court
is
not
whether
these
two
opposite
side
of
the
same
coin
can
be
viewed
separately
but
whether
his
failure
to
comply
with
his
obligation
to
be
cooperative
with
the
court
is
subject
to
the
claim
of
privilege
or
not
subject
to
the
claim
of
privilege.
this
is
phrase
incidentally
which
i
draw
off
in
justice
--
judge
cardozo,
then
judge
cardozo
in
the
case
of
karlin
v.
culkin
when
he
was
chief
judge
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
question
which
must
be
decided
is
his
failure
to
cooperate
subject
to
the
privilege
which
is
his
by
virtue
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
is
it
not
subject
to
a
privilege.
now,
that
question
was
not
looked
into,
not
examined
at
all
by
the
courts
of
new
york.
but
it
is
i
think
before
this
court
and
i
should
like
to
turn
to
it.
the
question
then
is,
what
are
the
possible
bases
for
concluding
as
new
york
would
like
to
conclude
that
this
duty
to
cooperate
must
prevail.
now
the
first
is
the
one
adhere
to
suggested
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
that
is
i
suppose
it
could
be
held
that
in
the
proceedings
such
as
this.
an
inference
of
guilt
or
of
misconduct
might
be
drawn,
though
you
cannot
under
the
griffin
case
draw
such
an
inference
in
other
proceedings.
this
i
must
say
would
go
into
conduct
to
virtually
every
decision
of
this
court.
if
there's
one
thing
that's
clear,
if
there's
one
thing
that
has
no
division
within
the
court
about
it
is
that
the
no
improper
inference
of
guilt
and
misconduct
of
any
kind
may
be
drawn
from
the
invocation
in
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
this
is
the
(inaudible)
decision
in
grinwold
and
griffin.
so
i
think
this
manner
of
saying
that
the
duty
to
cooperate
with
the
courts
which
regulate
the
practice
of
law
must
be
set
aside.
the
second
possibility
would
be
to
engage
in
analysis
of
the
comparative
value
of
a
--
the
comparative
importance
the
way
to
be
given
to
the
need
to
cooperate
with
the
court
as
against
the
policies.
the
importance
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
here
again,
i
think
we
run
into
a
consistent
line
of
decisions
of
this
court.
so
far
as
the
fifth
amendment
had
been
interpreted
date,
it's
been
uniformly
held
that
this
kind
of
process
is
not
engaged
in.
whatever
the
fifth
amendment
mean,
it
means
and
it's
not
to
be
abridged
by
virtue
of
what
is
considered
to
be
a
greater
objective
of
the
state.
the
objective
of
punishing
persons
who
are
thought
possibly
guilty
of
murder
or
other
serious
crime
is
certainly
as
important
to
one
as
we
know.
but
it
does
not
prevail
against
the
fifth
amendment
and
so
i
think
that
some
sort
of
waned
process
to
determine
the
relative
value
of
these
two
again
must
be
set
aside.
i
may
say
in
passing
that
even
in
such
process
where
to
be
engaged
in.
it
would
not
be
on
the
basis
of
simply
determination
of
which
would
they
considered
to
more
valuable.
the
test
would
have
to
be
one
of
necessity
rather
than
reasonable
relationship.
the
same
test
which
has
been
applied
in
shelton
v.
tucker,
mclaughlin
against
florida
and
a
host
of
other
cases
that
wherever
a
regulatory
function
has
the
tendency
to
impair
a
significant
constitutional
right.
a
much
sterner
test
has
been
applied
by
this
court
and
i
presume
will
continue
to
be
applied
by
this
court.
we
then
come
to
the
only
other
two
bases
that
i
can
see
for
reaching
the
conclusion
that
the
duty
to
cooperate
must
prevail
over
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
that
would
be
to
construe
the
fifth
amendment
narrowly
so
as
to
make
it
not
apply
in
this
situation
at
all
or
to
employ
some
sort
of
waiver
approach.
now,
i
mention
the
two
of
these
together
because
the
arguments
which
are
used
for
each
of
these
possible
bases
for
narrowing
the
protection
of
the
privilege
tend
to
be
the
same.
in
each
case,
the
same
starting
place
is
to
consider
the
role
of
the
lawyer
in
our
society.
it's
pointed
out
that
the
lawyers
are
engaged
in
the
administration
of
justice
that
there
were
no
public
service,
that
they
operate
on
the
high
ethical
standards
which
are
greater
than
those
normally
applied,
normally
demanded
of
other
professions.
now,
of
course
we
agree
fully
that
membership
in
the
bar
carries
with
it
proud
obligations
that
are
not
imposed
upon
other
occupations
nor
a
profession
say
if
the
duty
to
represent
indigents
for
example,
without
compensation
to
the
court
in
line,
limitations
upon
what
we
may
properly
do
in
advance
and
the
interest
of
our
clients
is
another.
i
think
however
that
as
lawyers
and
as
judges,
we
have
to
guard
against
being
taking
too
parochial
view
and
guard
also
against
being
swept
away
by
this
rhetoric.
the
--
there's
no
question
that
the
state
as
a
result
of
the
special
law
of
the
attorney
may
regulate
the
practice
of
law
very
closely
indeed
but
there
is
a
second
more
important
question
here
and
that
is
whether
there's
a
constitutional
difference
between
the
authority
to
regulate
the
bar
and
the
authority
to
regulate
any
other
profession.
and
try
as
i
may
--
i
don't
think
i
can
find
one.
there
are
countless
other
oblig
--
other
occupations
that
maybe
and
are
being
regulated
by
the
state
and
while
they
don't
avow
the
administration
of
justice,
they
all
relate
in
some
very
significant
way
to
public
health
to
the
public
safety.
at
least
they
involved
some
legitimate
concern
of
a
state.
and
i
see
no
way
in
which
one
could
not
find
a
rational
basis,
a
rational
reasons
for
a
legislator
to
conclude
that
if
it
is
regulating
a
particular
occupation
that
it
would
be
more
effective,
more
efficient,
if
it
could
demand
the
persons
who
are
engaged
in
that
occupation
that
they
respond
to
certain
questions
relating
to
the
manner
in
which
that
business
is
carried
out.
you
always
in
every
instance
in
which
there
is
regulatory
activity
being
carried
on
be
able
to
construct
a
sound
reasonable
argument
of
this
kind.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
i
certainly
hope
too,
because
i
think
that
the
argument
i
make
in
here
affect
the
shapiro
point
as
well.
i
simply
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
area
that
i'm
discussing
would
not
involved
merely
occupation
subject
to
regulation
but
the
very
vast
area
dealing
with
the
use
of
public
resources,
dealing
with
the
use
of
benefits
of
one
kind
or
another
that
the
government
provide
to
its
citizens.
i'm
talking
about
such
things
as
at
lease
of
government
land
that
received
the
proper
support
payments
more
of
its
insurance,
the
use
of
public
airports.
in
all
of
this
area,
it
is
always
possible
to
construct
a
rational
argument
for
showing
that
the
program
can
be
administered
more
efficiently.
if
the
recipients
of
these
benefits
where
to
respond
to
questions
about
how
the
benefits
are
to
be
used?
and
if
the
fifth
amendment
is
to
be
construed
so
that
it
no
longer
apply
in
every
instance
in
which
there
is
regulation
of
a
particular
industry.
then
this
would
represent
about
his
drastic
or
rejection
of
the
decisions
of
the
past
two
terms
as
could
be
possibly
imaginable.
now,
i
pass
over
my
discussion
of
the
weight
of
privilege
to
get
to
the
shapiro
case
because
i
think
that
what
i've
been
saying
until
now
affect
the
shapiro
doctrine
as
well.
in
that
case
to
recall
it
briefly
to
your
mind,
the
court
held
that
wherever
a
statute
or
regulation
requires
keeping
records.
those
records
which
otherwise
would
be
considered
private
which
might
had
been
kept
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
statute
are
somehow
converted
into
if
not
public
record
at
least
quasi-public
records
and
that
they're
not
protected
against
disclosure
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now,
this
holding
was
preceded
by
a
sentence
in
the
court's
opinion
which
bears
reading.
the
court
said,
“it
may
be
assumed
at
the
outset
that
there
are
limits
which
the
government
cannot
constitutionally
exceed
in
requiring
the
keeping
of
records
which
may
be
inspected
by
the
administrative
agency
and
may
be
used
in
prosecuting
statutory
violations
committed
by
the
record
keeper
himself.
but
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
“no
serious
misgiving
that
these
bounds
have
been
overstep
would
appear
to
be
evoked
where
there
is
--
when
there
is
a
sufficient
relations
between
the
activity
sort
to
be
regulated
and
the
public
concern.
so
that
the
government
can
constitutionally
regulate
or
forbid
the
basic
activity
concerned
and
can
constitutionally
require
the
keeping
of
a
particular
records
subject
to
inspection
by
the
administrator.
and
while
that
sentence
is
somewhat
circular,
its
breadth
is
enormous
and
particularly
in
terms
of
the
way
which
the
commerce
power
and
the
police
power
of
the
state
has
been
interpreted
today.
but
the
court
has
said,
“it's
in
every
instance
where
a
business
is
subject
to
regulation.
its
records
which
are
designated
as
required
to
be
kept
no
longer
are
entitled
to
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
the
face
of
the
set
of
rule
that
the
privilege
applies
to
documents
as
well
as
to
oral
testimony.
now,
this
--
the
question
really
is
how
shall
broad
an
en
route
into
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
could
have
been
rendered
by
this
court.
the
fact
is
that
there
is
a
uniform
cause
of
constitutional
adjudication
from
boyd
and
running
through
malloy
and
griffin,
and
miranda
last
term
in
which
repeatedly,
this
court
has
announced
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
to
be
given
a
broad
and
not
a
niggardly
or
grudging
interpretation.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well
i
think,
we
would
still
have
to
reverse
the
judgment
below
because
of
the,
first,
the
lack
of
clarity
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
second,
i
think
because
of
the
doctrine
of
raley
against
ohio
which
is
a
subsidiary
point
which
we
make
in
our
brief
which
i
have
not
planned
to
cover
an
argument.
so
that
there
are
the
grounds
which
i
think
would
require
reversal
on
the
decision
below.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
there
was
no
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
there
was
--
there
were
questions
put
unanswered
but
they
related
expressly
to
whether
he
would
produce
certain
designated
documents
called
for
by
the
subpoena
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
i
think
shapiro
itself
holds
and
your
other
cases
do
hold
that
the
privilege
does
apply
to
questions
which
are
related
to
documents.
that
issue
was
well
settled
and
it
is
not
to
be
reexamined
here?
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
not
involved
here.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
that
--
that's
quite
a
fair
statement
justice
fortas.
i
think
it
should
--
this
should
be
said,
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
to
the
extent
that
questions
were
put
were
upon
the
documents.
there
was
no
effort
to
go
through
this
charade
of
putting
a
great
many
questions
and
getting
answers
to
each
of
them
in
terms
of
whether
the
privilege
was
to
be
invoked
or
not.
i
think
that
the
presiding
justice
and
counsel
for
the
inquiry,
simply
wanted
to
make
a
clear
record
that
were
questions
were
put
and
he
was
called
to
the
purposes
of
testimony.
he
would
claim
his
privilege.
the
record
was
clearly
made
and
this
was
considered
satisfactory
by
all
concerned.
but
it
is
certain
true
that
the
focus
was
upon
the
records
and
i
think
there
is
substantial
basis
for
your
reaching
the
question
of
whether
shapiro
should
continue
to
be
applied?
the
fact
is
that
this
case
stands
out
as
a
glaring
excrescence
upon
the
line
of
constitutional
decisions
that
runs
from
boyd
until
the
present
time.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
no,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
affirm
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
let
me
make
direct
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
it
is
pretty
close
to
it
justice
fortas
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
now
i
think,
it's
fair
to
say
that
you
look
at
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
it
does
read
affirm
on
the
basis
that
cohen
against
hurley
and
on
the
further
ground
that
shapiro
applies
and
it
--
it
might
not
be
possible
to
say
that
if
the
courts,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
had
understood
and
had
recognized
that
cohen
v.
hurley
was
no
longer
a
good
law
that
the
decision
would
have
been
the
same.
but
i
must
agree
that
shapiro
is
presented
here
or
almost
presented.
i'll
put
it
that
way.
i
think
also
the
fact
that
he
was
assured
by
the
presiding
justice
that
he
had
a
privilege
with
respect
to
the
documents
at
the
time
that
these
questions
were
put
and
the
fact
that
the
appellate
division
reaffirmed
the
fact
that
he
had
a
privilege
with
respect
to
these
documents
would
bring
the
raley
against
ohio
case
into
play.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
if
--
well,
in
raley
against
ohio,
the
petitioners
there
were
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
because
of
immunity
statute.
i
think
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
he
was
told
that
he
had
a
privilege
with
respect
to
these
documents.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes.
the
cohen
and
hurley
did
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
he
was
relying
if,
your
honor
please,
upon
the
malloy
against
hogan
case.
the
cohen
against
hurley
case
made
a
quite
claim
that
there
was
no
question
of
the
applicability
of
the
fifth
amendment
on
that
case.
but
he
was
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
right.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
that
was
to
determine
whether
the
rational
of
the
court
was
acceptable.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
no.
that
cohen
and
hurley
was
at
this
case
that
this
was
suspended
for.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh!
well,
ask
the
cohen
against
hurley.
he
was
again
assured
that
he
have
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination
relating
to
these
documents.
cohen
and
hurley
didn't
touch
that
at
all.
following
your
decision
he
was
told,
“yes,
you
may
refuse
to
produce
these
documents
by
reason
of
the
privilege
which
you
enjoy
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
it
was
only
when
he
got
to
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
oh,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
alternatively
that
he
did
not
have
any
privilege
at
all
with
respect
to
these
documents.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
because
of
shapiro
but
this
was
not
involved
at
all
while
the
judicial
inquiry
was
going
on
and
there's
nothing
in
the
appellate
division
opinioned
itself
that
relates
to
this.
this
came
up
only
when
the
court
of
appeals
rendered
its
decisions.
there
was
something
in
briefs
to
that
effect
i
should
add.
but
it
did
not
come
up
at
all
until
the
appellate
division
had
decided
the
case.
so
that
i
think
the
situation
is
very
comfortable
to
what
it
was
in
raley
against
ohio.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
i'm
content
to
have
you
reach
and
decide
the
shapiro
case
because
i
do
think
the
court
should
do
so.
if
i
may,
i
can't
cover
the
shapiro
case
in
the
moment
or
two
that
i
have
available.
but
i'd
like
to
point
to
one
thing
about
it.
the
statute
involved
in
shapiro
required
every
person
subject
to
this
regulation.
to
keep
and
make
available
for
examination
by
the
office
of
price
administration
records
of
the
same
kind
as
he
has
customarily
kept
relating
to
the
prices
which
he
charges
for
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables.
and
the
bases
upon
which
he
determine
maximum
prices
for
these
commodities.
i
suggest
that
if
that
statute
had
gone
on
to
say
and
every
such
person
who
fails
to
keep
such
records
or
whose
records
are
inadequate
shall
appear
before
the
administrator
upon
his
demand
and
shall
give
testimony
concerning
the
prices
which
he
charges
for
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
and
the
bases
upon
which
he
determine
maximum
prices
for
those
commodities.
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
shapiro
case
that
will
indicate
in
any
way
why
there
should
be
a
differentiation
between
the
record
portion
of
that
statute
which
i
have
hypothesized
and
the
oral
portion
of
that.
the
opinion
itself
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
i
have
made
an
argument
in
our
brief
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
--
that
the
record
keeping
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
well,
mr.
justice
fortas
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
--
i
must
say,
we
have
briefed
and
argued
this
case
under
this
assumption
that
the
power
of
the
appellate
division
to
regulate
the
practice
of
law
is
very
broad
indeed.
and
that
it
does
have
the
authority
to
require
the
keeping
of
records
of
this
time.
do
not
think
that
should
carry
with
it
automatically
the
abandonment
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
unless
you
are
prepared
to
overall
avoid
and
to
hold
that
the
documentary
matter
is
not
subject
to
the
privilege
as
oral
testimony
is.
that's
would
require
to
--
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
all
that
i
suggest
is
that
there's
not
a
word
in
shapiro
that
suggest
what
that
difference
might
be.
and
that
other
decision
of
this
court
such
as
albertson
make
it
plain
that
there
should
be
no
significant
difference
between
documents
and
oral
testimony.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
no.
i
--
i
do
think
that
there
was
an
intention
to
require
him
to
testify
and
to
make
a
record
to
that
effect.
mr.
lawrence
j.
latto
yes.
they're
testimonial
record.
i
think
in
fact
they're
broader
than
the
records.
he
was
required
to
keep
by
rule
5
of
the
appellate
division.
but
this
is
another
point
entirely.
