mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
point
here
is
that
congress
has
made
it
quite
clear
what
it
was
doing
in
1959.
the
commission
recognized
that
at
that
time
and
to
some
extent
the
commission
recognizes
it
today.
when
this
proceeding
that's
now
before
the
court
and
we
want
to
if
we
can
to
invite
your
attention
to
this
proceeding
as
dramatically
as
we
can
and
not
some
other
case
that
might
come
up
some
day.
this
proceeding
when
it
was
initiated
in
the
summer
of
1964,
if
the
federal
trade
commission
at
that
time
and
now
makes
available
a
very
handy
government
printing
office
publication
containing
it's
rules
and
containing
various
other
statutes
that
the
commission
has
responsibility
to
enforce.
and
if
anyone
in
the
summer
of
'64
or
anytime
since
august
1963
looks
at
the
copy
of
the
clayton
act
that's
printed
in
this
publication,
he
doesn't
find
any
of
these
provisions
that
the
government
tried
to
tell
the
court
of
appeals
in
san
francisco
are
those
that
their
petition
is
filed
under.
he
looks
in
here
and
here
is
section
11
of
the
clayton
act
as
it
now
appears
in
the
united
states
code
and
has
consistently
appeared
united
states
code
each
time
anybody
considered
it
since
1959.
now
there
is
a
clue
in
this
publication
and
incidentally
i
went
by
there
on
the
way
up
to
court
this
morning
and
asked
simply
for
a
slip
copy
of
the
clayton
act,
the
legal
public
record
section
of
federal
trade
commission
and
it's
identical
to
what
i'm
attempting
to
show
right
now.
the
same
thing,
the
statute
as
it
appears
in
the
united
states
code
with
a
footnote
then
at
the
end
of
sub
section
b
of
section
11
and
there
that
footnote
says
that
there
was
this
amendment
in
1959
public
law
86-107
which
re-designated
the
first
two
sub-paragraphs
of
section
11
of
the
clayton
act
and
then
amended
third,
fourth,
fifth,
six
and
so
on
providing
this
procedure
which
mr.
spritzer
has
carefully
laid
out
is
the
current
method
for
enforcement
of
clayton
act
orders.
it
says
that
there
was
this
amendment
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
paraphrasing
section
2
of
the
1959
amendment.
the
amendment
so
made
do
not
apply
to
any
proceeding
initiated
before
the
date
of
enactment
of
that
act
under
the
third
or
fourth
paragraph
of
section
11.
now
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
or
i
won't
question
anybody's
motivation
but
the
fact
is
that
the
counsel
continually
referred
to
that
second
section
of
the
finality
act
of
1959
as
referring
only
to
pending
cases.
that's
just
not
correct
and
the
commission
lays
it
out
in
here.
that
second
section
said
that,
shall
–
these
amendments
shall
have
no
application
to
any
proceeding
initiated
under
the
third
or
fourth
paragraph
and
the
third
paragraph
of
the
old
section
11.
the
old
section
11,
the
third
paragraph
was
reviewed,
it
was
enforcement
proceedings
and
the
fourth
paragraph
was
review
proceedings.
so
that
let's
not
have
the
court
be
confused
as
to
what
the
finality
act
of
1959
on
its
face
did.
it
specifically
preserved
any
--
the
old
method
of
procedure
for
any
proceedings
for
review
or
enforcement
previously
initiated
and
i
would
suggest
that,
that
means
all
of
the
significant
cases
or
close
to
all
of
them
and
i
will
come
to
that
if
i
may,
but
for
instance
don't
have
this
misunderstanding.
if
in
1955,
this
court
or
a
court
of
appeals
reviewed
and
affirmed
an
old
federal
trade
commission
clayton
act
order
this
1959
act
on
its
face
preserves
that
specific
method
of
enforcement
and
we
are
not
contending
that
it
doesn't
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
saying
that
it
doesn't,
those
are
totally
unaffected
by
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
now
to
go
on
then
as
to
what
the
federal
trade
commission,
its
publication
tells
you
about
this,
they
tell
you
about
the
section
2
and
they
each
such
proceeding
that
is,
those
were
that
was
a
review
or
enforcement
proceeding
previously
initiated
continues
to
be
governed
by
the
provisions
of
such
section
as
they
existed
on
the
day
proceeding
the
date
of
enactment
of
public
law
86-107.
now
you
don't
find
anywhere
else
unless
i
am
mistaken
in
the
commission's
rules
or
its
publications
any
clue
that
they
are
going
to
tend
to
regard
some
other
provisions
of
law
which
have
been
repealed
as
still
in
effect.
the
handling
--
the
code
of
files
of
the
u.s.
code
didn't
do
the
same.
the
court
will
recognize
that
the
u.s.
code
as
prima
facie
that's
the
law
here
and
we
submit
then
that
that's
lesser
some
terribly
persuasive
reason
as
to
why
that
isn't
the
law
and
that
just
settles
the
case.
now
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
a
federal
trade
commission
publication,
organization,
procedures,
rules
and
practices
and
statutes,
august
1963
for
sale
by
the
superintendent
of
documents
u.s.
government
printing
office,
list
of
commissioners,
list
of
principle
staff
officers
and
it
contains
the
commission's
rules,
much
of
it
required
by
federal
regulations
and
then
these
statutes.
and
that
if
you
go
down
today
and
ask
the
federal
trade
commission
for
a
copy
of
the
clayton
act
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
what
i
guess
my
point
is
that
the
law
is
clear
on
its
face
and
they
have
recognized
it.
and
now
we
have
--
i
don't
need
to
dispute
it
that
the
solicitor
general,
mr.
justice
fortas,
he
represents
the
federal
trade
commission,
but
the
only
written
expression,
the
only
opinion
that
we
have
from
the
federal
trade
commission
on
this
question,
are
those
written
views
of
commissioner
eleanor.
now
we
can
be
sure
some
commissioners
must
take
a
different
view.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes
certainly
you
could.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
i'm
not
trying
to
argue
that
simply
because
the
trade
commission
says
it
or
doesn't
say
it,
is.
it's
the
view
you
want
to
adopt.
our
position
is
that
it
that
this
is
the
view
you
ought
to
adopt
regardless
of
the
position
the
commission
takes.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes
sir.
now
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
talk
about
some
other
case
but
if
--
just
to
get
into
what
is
the
law
here,
we
submit
the
law
is
clear
on
its
face.
that
the
country
lawyers
have
exacted
the
old
provisions
and
pasted
in
the
new
ones
and
the
code
of
files
have
done
that.
now
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
the
new
procedure
applies
in
a
way
justice
clark,
but
let
me
try
to
give
our
answer
to
that.
there
is
the
basic
misunderstanding
here
on,
i
submit
on
the
part
of
the
government
at
this
time
and
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
as
to
what
the
result
will
be
or
what
effect
on
enforceability
of
old
orders
there
might
be
and
let
me
get
into
that
in
this
way.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
adopts
this,
what
is
the
government
position
here,
that
if
you
let
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
stand
then
all
these
old
orders
will
be
unenforceable.
now
we
submit
that
that's
just
not
the
case.
that
first
of
all
the
finality
act
of
1959
preserves
on
its
face
those
old
orders
which
as
to
which
a
review
or
enforcement
proceeding
had
previously
been
initiative.
secondly
we
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
if
there
were
no
review
proceeding
then
we
would
suggest
to
you
the
views
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
at
least
one
member
of
the
commission.
there
maybe
a
variety
of
things
that
commission
can
do.
for
one
thing
lets
take
a
case
in
which,
well
first
let
me
tell
our
case.
what
could
the
commission
do
in
our
case?
the
commission
in
our
case
could
simply
issue
a
new
complaint,
allege
the
violations
of
law
and
the
burden
would
have
been
no
greater
on
the
commission
to
come
up
with
an
order
which
would
be
enforceable
by
civil
penalties.
in
our
case
justice
clark--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
it
would
abandon
it
only
in
this
respect,
it
would
abandon
it
because
the
act
of
congress
in
1959
gave
the
commission
so
much
better
weapon.
if
i
try
to
understand
really
why
the
commission
did
what
it
in
this
case,
why
didn't
they
simply
issue
of
new
complaint.
i
suggest
to
you
it
is
because
it's
hard
for
them
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the,
the
earlier
proceeding
was
worthless
that
they
were
wasting
their
time.
i
submit
in
those
cases
in
which
anything
was
established
in
the
earlier
proceeding
it's
still
established
and
in
those
cases
in
which
nothing
was
established,
they
aren't
any
farther
behind
and
it
wasn't
their
fault.
it
isn't
that
they
didn't
do
a
good
job
prior
to
1959,
it's
because
that
procedure
prior
to
1959
was
cumbersome
so
laborious
it
didn't
accomplish
anything
that's
the
reason
the
congress
changed
the
law
in
1959.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well,
let
me
try
to
put
that
perspective,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
white.
if
the
commission
proceeded
by
way
of
new
complaint
now
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i'm
not
saying
that
they
should
do
that
i'm
saying
that's
open
as
an
alternative
to
them
if
this
court
affirmed
the
court
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yeah
that's
our
basic
position
and
the
record
demonstrates
that.
the
record
shows
that
this
respondent
is
now
complying
with
the
law
that
is
instituted
federal
system
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
law
and
our
position
is
that
there
isn't
any
need
for
any
sort
of
proceeding.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
the
commission
alleged
that
jantzen
violated
the
statute
when
it
started
its
complaint
proceeding
in
1958.
that
was,
that
proceeding
was
disposed
off
by
jantzen's
not
--
jantzen
didn't
admit
or
deny
those
that
the
complaint
alleged
that
jantzen
had
a
plan
for
promotional
allowances
which
had
a
minimum
purchase
requirement,
and
the
commission
said
this
doesn't
comply
with
section
2(d)
of
the
clayton
act
and
jantzen
said
in
effect
under
procedure
that
the
commission
then
had,
all
right
we
just
won't
litigate
with
you
over
that,
we
will
consent
to
your
issuance
of
what
you
say
as
an
order.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
now
in
1964
the
commission
began
this
investigation
hearing
as
it
said
to
determine
whether
jantzen
had
complied
with
the
old
order.
and
we
stipulated
in
that
proceeding
and
this
proceeding
was
initiated
1964,
that
there
were
two
payments
in
1960
and
one
in
1962,
which
are
not
available
on
proportionately
equal
terms
to
competing
customers
and
therefore
they
did
not,
they
were
not
in
compliance
with
either
the
older
order.
in
this
case
the
government
doesn't
content
that
there
is
any
distinction
between
the
orders
that
was
issued
or
what
statuette
would
require.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
but
what
i
submit
mr.
justice
clark
is
they
don't
have
any
greater
remedy
under
the
old
procedure.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
our
basic
position
yes
sir
we
--
but
we
willing
to
go
further
though
and
talk
about
other
cases
if
that's
what
the
government
wants
to
talk
about.
we
don't--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
assume
say
that
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
if
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
in
our
case
it's
–-
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
not
necessarily
mr.
justice
brennan,
not
necessarily.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
for
one
thing
the
court
of
appeals'
jurisdiction,
if
it
has
any,
under
the
old
procedure
--
under
the
old
provision
was
to
modify
a
firm
or
set
aside
the
commission's
order.
the
only
other
thing
in
there
that
said
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
be
guided
by
was
–-
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
correct
mr.
brennan
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
satisfied,
that's
what
it
ought
to
do
but
it's
not
a
mechanical
thing.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
right
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i
think
that's
as
commissioner
eleanor
suggests
that's
a
better
position
for
the
government
because
then
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
a
good
question
mr.
justice
white
and
the
answer
is
we
didn't
bring
this
case
here
and
we
didn't
take
it
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
our
basic
position
is
as
we
have
never
got
into
the
court
of
appeals
that
on
the
merits
whatever
jurisdiction
or
provisions
that
apply
this
is
not
--
the
commission
should
not
have
initiated
this
proceeding.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well,
what
jantzen
is
doing
is
simply
pointing
out
what
the
acts
of
congress
is
seem
to
say
and
furthermore
we
are
attempting
to
point
out
that
the
government's
parade
of
horribles
simply
they
require
speculation,
they
require
a
guess.
this
suggestion
that
there
is
a
case
somewhere
and
mind
you
it
hasn't
been
pointed
out
yet
where
the
commission
would
have
a
lesser
burden,
we
submit
may
very
well
not
exist.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
my
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
black
is
that
it
did
not
obliterate
any
old
orders.
it
simply
–-
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
unless
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
a
petition
had
previously
been
filed
to
review
or
in
force.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
our
answer
--
we
accept
the
government's
figures.
they
said
that
there
are
roughly
400.
now
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
mr.
justice
black
i've
just
had
made
myself
clear,
it's
my
fault.
we
submit
that
anything
of
value
in
those
proceedings
has
been
preserved.
we
submit
that
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
if
something
that's
raised
res
judicata
is
res
judicata
as
commissioner
eleanor
points.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
those
orders
being
those--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well,
commissioner
eleanor
suggested
that
they
can
take
–-
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
commission
will
not
be.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes.
to
go
back
to
justice
white
question
if
i
may
and
it's
my
lack
of
articulacy,
i'm
not
trying
to
run
away
from
any
question.
the
--
if
you
take
any
particular
case
in
which
the
commission
might
want
to
enforce
an
old
order
i
submit
to
the
court
if
you
analyze
it
they
are
just
as
well
or
better
off
under
the
new
procedure.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
congress--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
if
you
take
the
senate
committee
report
which
the
government
has
reproduced.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
if
i—-
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
the
commission
came
to
the
congress
prior
to
19--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
what
i
am
resisting
mr.
justice
black
is
the
conclusion
that
anything
was
wiped
out.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
first
of
all
they
can
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes
sir
it
can.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
in
the
ruberoid
case,
national
led
case,
all
those
cases
where
a
petition
to
review
had
been
filed
prior
to
1959,
and
they
are
all
preserved.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
only,
sure.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i
submit
that
they
are
not.
for
example
take
a
case
maybe
like
national
life
where
there
were
some
fencing
in,
but
the
respondent
did
not
petition
for
review
and
prior
to
1959
no
petition
for
enforcement
was
filed.
so
that
on
the
face
of
the
1959
act
we
have
a
case
now
in
which
in
a
sense
we
might
say
the
old
order
is
wiped
out.
here
is
what
i
suggest
that
you
keep
in
mind.
as
to
that
case,
the
commission
has
the
record,
it
has
the
findings,
which
are
just
as
valid
as
the
other
were
and
by
–
well
if
they
start
a
new
proceeding,
secondly
if
you
are
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
but
they'll
have
to
do
that
even
if
the
old
provisions
were
preserved,
but
let
me
if
i
may
take
that
hypothetically,
which
i
submit
is
a
hypothetical.
the
government
has
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
my
answer
is
simply
that
you
analyze
that
effectiveness,
it
disappears
that
these
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
but
if
you
are
down
to
those
cases
you
find
and
in
contrast
what
the
commission
has
to
do
under
the
provisions
of
law
that
used
to
apply
with
what
we'd
have
to
do
under
the
new
procedure
i
submit
there
isn't
a
great,
there
isn't
a
significant
amount
of
difference.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
if
you
compare
it
with
what
they
had
to
do
under
the
old
statute
that
in
a
sense
was,
you
concede
the
same
document
if
–
but
i'm
not,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
if
you
take
one
of
these
cases
mr.
justice
black
which
they,
where
they
say
there
was
some
fencing
in
or
where
they
say
there
was
some
issue
and
where
no
review
or
a
court
presentation
had
been
an
issue.
take
a
case
like
that,
even
if
the
old
provisions
of
law
were
still
in
effect
the
commission
has
to
give
notice,
has
to
have
a
hearing,
has
to
make
a
finding
of
violation
and
then
when
it
petitions
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
has
to
satisfy
the
court
of
appeals
not
only
that
the
order
has
been
violated,
but
that
the
original,
the
finding
of
fact
in
the
old
proceeding
were
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
that
the
conclusions
of
all
in
that
proceeding
were
correct
and
that
the
scope
of
the
order
in
that
proceeding
was
appropriate.
now
we
submit
that
that's
all
litigation
that's
still
opened
to
occur
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well,
we
argued
two
other
things
in
addition
to
this
point
which
is
a
threshold
one.
one
that
that
the
commissions
order
was
not
valid
in
this
proceeding
in
the
original
proceeding
and
secondly
that
if
it
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
exercising
its
jurisdiction
if
it
was
going
to
assume
it
should
not
properly
in
this
case
order
enforcement.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
reach
those
questions.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
the
commission
couldn't,
couldn't
start
with
any
more
unchallenged
facts
one
way
or
other
in
our
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
our
position,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i
don't
agree
with
anything
that
the
commissioner
elanor
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i
see
my
time
is
supposed
to
be
up
and
i
would
like
if
i
may
just
try
to
bring
the
attention
back
to
this
one
question.
if
the
government's
argument
of
statutory
construction
here
what
statute
is
it
arguing
should
be
construed
and
what
words
in
what
statute
should
be
construed
in
what
way
to
come
out
with
any
result
other
than
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
submit
that
question
as
i
never
even
been
hinted
at
in
any
of
the
government's
briefs
or
oral
arguments.
secondly
i
do
want
to
try
to
comeback
to
the
second
circuit.
the
second
circuit
we
submit
simply
misunderstood
this,
the
issue.
first
of
all
they
had
a
case
before,
the
second
circuit
had
a
case
before
it
in
which
the
terms
of
section
two
of
the
1959
act
explicitly
applied
and
they
said
so.
and
then
they
went
on
gratuitously
to
state
that
they
didn't
like
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here
because
and
they
don't
say
what
they
would,
they
don't
say
how
they
would
construe
the
statute
otherwise
they
just
say
we
don't
like
this
result
because
it
disregards
two
factors
and
then
the
two
factors
they
state
are
simply
not
correct.
they
misunderstood
the,
in
the
sense
of
the
non-enforceability
of
the
orders
issued
prior
1959
no
matter
which
methods
or
procedure
apply
and
they
went
on
just
to
conclude
that
well
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
somehow
inconsistent
with
some
vague
general
intention
of
congress
and
we
submit
to
you
that
that's
not
correct,
that's
not,
they
didn't
need
to
do
that
and
they
were
wrong
in
doing
so.
and
as
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
those
cases
there,
question
wasn't
before
them
at
all.
in
those
cases
the
court
was
simply
reviewing
the
commission's
attempt
by
blanket
[voice
overlap]
to
give
automatic
penalty
within
60
days
of
the
passage
of
the
1959
act
to
all
lawyers.
and
actually
counsel
in
that
case
was
not
trying
to
take
on
an
added
burden
when
they
said
the
commission
can't
do
this.
now
the
commission
when
that
--
there
was
no
petition
for
certiorari
from
those
dc
cases
and
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
it
attempted
to
blanket
in
all
these
old
orders
in
a
way
that
that
the
contrast
between
the
wheeler-lea
amendments
and
the
1959
amendments
just
simply
wouldn't
permit.
it
was
rebuffed
on
that.
rather
than
go
back
to
congress
they
then
come
along
at
some
later
year
and
try
to
get
the
courts
now
to
just
straighten
and
rewrite
the
1959
act.
now
why
are
1959
act
and
why
was
it
written
that
way,
for
one
thing
we
submit
because
the
commission
at
that
time
didn't
point
out
any
of
these
possible
horribles
that
it's
arguing
now.
if
you
look
inside
the
keith
travis
(ph)
committee
reports,
it's
clear
that
the
understanding
of
that
committee
was
you
had
approved
three
violations
of
law
to
achieve
anything.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
point
here
is
that
congress
has
made
it
quite
clear
what
it
was
doing
in
1959.
the
commission
recognized
that
at
that
time
and
to
some
extent
the
commission
recognizes
it
today.
when
this
proceeding
that's
now
before
the
court
and
we
want
to
if
we
can
to
invite
your
attention
to
this
proceeding
as
dramatically
as
we
can
and
not
some
other
case
that
might
come
up
some
day.
this
proceeding
when
it
was
initiated
in
the
summer
of
1964,
if
the
federal
trade
commission
at
that
time
and
now
makes
available
a
very
handy
government
printing
office
publication
containing
it's
rules
and
containing
various
other
statutes
that
the
commission
has
responsibility
to
enforce.
and
if
anyone
in
the
summer
of
'64
or
anytime
since
august
1963
looks
at
the
copy
of
the
clayton
act
that's
printed
in
this
publication,
he
doesn't
find
any
of
these
provisions
that
the
government
tried
to
tell
the
court
of
appeals
in
san
francisco
are
those
that
their
petition
is
filed
under.
he
looks
in
here
and
here
is
section
11
of
the
clayton
act
as
it
now
appears
in
the
united
states
code
and
has
consistently
appeared
united
states
code
each
time
anybody
considered
it
since
1959.
now
there
is
a
clue
in
this
publication
and
incidentally
i
went
by
there
on
the
way
up
to
court
this
morning
and
asked
simply
for
a
slip
copy
of
the
clayton
act,
the
legal
public
record
section
of
federal
trade
commission
and
it's
identical
to
what
i'm
attempting
to
show
right
now.
the
same
thing,
the
statute
as
it
appears
in
the
united
states
code
with
a
footnote
then
at
the
end
of
sub
section
b
of
section
11
and
there
that
footnote
says
that
there
was
this
amendment
in
1959
public
law
86-107
which
re-designated
the
first
two
sub-paragraphs
of
section
11
of
the
clayton
act
and
then
amended
third,
fourth,
fifth,
six
and
so
on
providing
this
procedure
which
mr.
spritzer
has
carefully
laid
out
is
the
current
method
for
enforcement
of
clayton
act
orders.
it
says
that
there
was
this
amendment
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
paraphrasing
section
2
of
the
1959
amendment.
the
amendment
so
made
do
not
apply
to
any
proceeding
initiated
before
the
date
of
enactment
of
that
act
under
the
third
or
fourth
paragraph
of
section
11.
now
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
or
i
won't
question
anybody's
motivation
but
the
fact
is
that
the
counsel
continually
referred
to
that
second
section
of
the
finality
act
of
1959
as
referring
only
to
pending
cases.
that's
just
not
correct
and
the
commission
lays
it
out
in
here.
that
second
section
said
that,
shall
–
these
amendments
shall
have
no
application
to
any
proceeding
initiated
under
the
third
or
fourth
paragraph
and
the
third
paragraph
of
the
old
section
11.
the
old
section
11,
the
third
paragraph
was
reviewed,
it
was
enforcement
proceedings
and
the
fourth
paragraph
was
review
proceedings.
so
that
let's
not
have
the
court
be
confused
as
to
what
the
finality
act
of
1959
on
its
face
did.
it
specifically
preserved
any
--
the
old
method
of
procedure
for
any
proceedings
for
review
or
enforcement
previously
initiated
and
i
would
suggest
that,
that
means
all
of
the
significant
cases
or
close
to
all
of
them
and
i
will
come
to
that
if
i
may,
but
for
instance
don't
have
this
misunderstanding.
if
in
1955,
this
court
or
a
court
of
appeals
reviewed
and
affirmed
an
old
federal
trade
commission
clayton
act
order
this
1959
act
on
its
face
preserves
that
specific
method
of
enforcement
and
we
are
not
contending
that
it
doesn't
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
saying
that
it
doesn't,
those
are
totally
unaffected
by
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case.
now
to
go
on
then
as
to
what
the
federal
trade
commission,
its
publication
tells
you
about
this,
they
tell
you
about
the
section
2
and
they
each
such
proceeding
that
is,
those
were
that
was
a
review
or
enforcement
proceeding
previously
initiated
continues
to
be
governed
by
the
provisions
of
such
section
as
they
existed
on
the
day
proceeding
the
date
of
enactment
of
public
law
86-107.
now
you
don't
find
anywhere
else
unless
i
am
mistaken
in
the
commission's
rules
or
its
publications
any
clue
that
they
are
going
to
tend
to
regard
some
other
provisions
of
law
which
have
been
repealed
as
still
in
effect.
the
handling
--
the
code
of
files
of
the
u.s.
code
didn't
do
the
same.
the
court
will
recognize
that
the
u.s.
code
as
prima
facie
that's
the
law
here
and
we
submit
then
that
that's
lesser
some
terribly
persuasive
reason
as
to
why
that
isn't
the
law
and
that
just
settles
the
case.
now
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
a
federal
trade
commission
publication,
organization,
procedures,
rules
and
practices
and
statutes,
august
1963
for
sale
by
the
superintendent
of
documents
u.s.
government
printing
office,
list
of
commissioners,
list
of
principle
staff
officers
and
it
contains
the
commission's
rules,
much
of
it
required
by
federal
regulations
and
then
these
statutes.
and
that
if
you
go
down
today
and
ask
the
federal
trade
commission
for
a
copy
of
the
clayton
act
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
what
i
guess
my
point
is
that
the
law
is
clear
on
its
face
and
they
have
recognized
it.
and
now
we
have
--
i
don't
need
to
dispute
it
that
the
solicitor
general,
mr.
justice
fortas,
he
represents
the
federal
trade
commission,
but
the
only
written
expression,
the
only
opinion
that
we
have
from
the
federal
trade
commission
on
this
question,
are
those
written
views
of
commissioner
eleanor.
now
we
can
be
sure
some
commissioners
must
take
a
different
view.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes
certainly
you
could.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i
think
mr.
justice
fortas
i'm
not
trying
to
argue
that
simply
because
the
trade
commission
says
it
or
doesn't
say
it,
is.
it's
the
view
you
want
to
adopt.
our
position
is
that
it
that
this
is
the
view
you
ought
to
adopt
regardless
of
the
position
the
commission
takes.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes
sir.
now
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
talk
about
some
other
case
but
if
--
just
to
get
into
what
is
the
law
here,
we
submit
the
law
is
clear
on
its
face.
that
the
country
lawyers
have
exacted
the
old
provisions
and
pasted
in
the
new
ones
and
the
code
of
files
have
done
that.
now
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
the
new
procedure
applies
in
a
way
justice
clark,
but
let
me
try
to
give
our
answer
to
that.
there
is
the
basic
misunderstanding
here
on,
i
submit
on
the
part
of
the
government
at
this
time
and
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
as
to
what
the
result
will
be
or
what
effect
on
enforceability
of
old
orders
there
might
be
and
let
me
get
into
that
in
this
way.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
adopts
this,
what
is
the
government
position
here,
that
if
you
let
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
stand
then
all
these
old
orders
will
be
unenforceable.
now
we
submit
that
that's
just
not
the
case.
that
first
of
all
the
finality
act
of
1959
preserves
on
its
face
those
old
orders
which
as
to
which
a
review
or
enforcement
proceeding
had
previously
been
initiative.
secondly
we
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
if
there
were
no
review
proceeding
then
we
would
suggest
to
you
the
views
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
at
least
one
member
of
the
commission.
there
maybe
a
variety
of
things
that
commission
can
do.
for
one
thing
lets
take
a
case
in
which,
well
first
let
me
tell
our
case.
what
could
the
commission
do
in
our
case?
the
commission
in
our
case
could
simply
issue
a
new
complaint,
allege
the
violations
of
law
and
the
burden
would
have
been
no
greater
on
the
commission
to
come
up
with
an
order
which
would
be
enforceable
by
civil
penalties.
in
our
case
justice
clark--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
it
would
abandon
it
only
in
this
respect,
it
would
abandon
it
because
the
act
of
congress
in
1959
gave
the
commission
so
much
better
weapon.
if
i
try
to
understand
really
why
the
commission
did
what
it
in
this
case,
why
didn't
they
simply
issue
of
new
complaint.
i
suggest
to
you
it
is
because
it's
hard
for
them
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the,
the
earlier
proceeding
was
worthless
that
they
were
wasting
their
time.
i
submit
in
those
cases
in
which
anything
was
established
in
the
earlier
proceeding
it's
still
established
and
in
those
cases
in
which
nothing
was
established,
they
aren't
any
farther
behind
and
it
wasn't
their
fault.
it
isn't
that
they
didn't
do
a
good
job
prior
to
1959,
it's
because
that
procedure
prior
to
1959
was
cumbersome
so
laborious
it
didn't
accomplish
anything
that's
the
reason
the
congress
changed
the
law
in
1959.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well,
let
me
try
to
put
that
perspective,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
white.
if
the
commission
proceeded
by
way
of
new
complaint
now
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i'm
not
saying
that
they
should
do
that
i'm
saying
that's
open
as
an
alternative
to
them
if
this
court
affirmed
the
court
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yeah
that's
our
basic
position
and
the
record
demonstrates
that.
the
record
shows
that
this
respondent
is
now
complying
with
the
law
that
is
instituted
federal
system
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
law
and
our
position
is
that
there
isn't
any
need
for
any
sort
of
proceeding.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
the
commission
alleged
that
jantzen
violated
the
statute
when
it
started
its
complaint
proceeding
in
1958.
that
was,
that
proceeding
was
disposed
off
by
jantzen's
not
--
jantzen
didn't
admit
or
deny
those
that
the
complaint
alleged
that
jantzen
had
a
plan
for
promotional
allowances
which
had
a
minimum
purchase
requirement,
and
the
commission
said
this
doesn't
comply
with
section
2(d)
of
the
clayton
act
and
jantzen
said
in
effect
under
procedure
that
the
commission
then
had,
all
right
we
just
won't
litigate
with
you
over
that,
we
will
consent
to
your
issuance
of
what
you
say
as
an
order.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
now
in
1964
the
commission
began
this
investigation
hearing
as
it
said
to
determine
whether
jantzen
had
complied
with
the
old
order.
and
we
stipulated
in
that
proceeding
and
this
proceeding
was
initiated
1964,
that
there
were
two
payments
in
1960
and
one
in
1962,
which
are
not
available
on
proportionately
equal
terms
to
competing
customers
and
therefore
they
did
not,
they
were
not
in
compliance
with
either
the
older
order.
in
this
case
the
government
doesn't
content
that
there
is
any
distinction
between
the
orders
that
was
issued
or
what
statuette
would
require.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
but
what
i
submit
mr.
justice
clark
is
they
don't
have
any
greater
remedy
under
the
old
procedure.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
our
basic
position
yes
sir
we
--
but
we
willing
to
go
further
though
and
talk
about
other
cases
if
that's
what
the
government
wants
to
talk
about.
we
don't--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
assume
say
that
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
if
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
in
our
case
it's
–-
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
not
necessarily
mr.
justice
brennan,
not
necessarily.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
for
one
thing
the
court
of
appeals'
jurisdiction,
if
it
has
any,
under
the
old
procedure
--
under
the
old
provision
was
to
modify
a
firm
or
set
aside
the
commission's
order.
the
only
other
thing
in
there
that
said
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
be
guided
by
was
–-
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
correct
mr.
brennan
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
satisfied,
that's
what
it
ought
to
do
but
it's
not
a
mechanical
thing.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
right
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i
think
that's
as
commissioner
eleanor
suggests
that's
a
better
position
for
the
government
because
then
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
a
good
question
mr.
justice
white
and
the
answer
is
we
didn't
bring
this
case
here
and
we
didn't
take
it
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
our
basic
position
is
as
we
have
never
got
into
the
court
of
appeals
that
on
the
merits
whatever
jurisdiction
or
provisions
that
apply
this
is
not
--
the
commission
should
not
have
initiated
this
proceeding.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well,
what
jantzen
is
doing
is
simply
pointing
out
what
the
acts
of
congress
is
seem
to
say
and
furthermore
we
are
attempting
to
point
out
that
the
government's
parade
of
horribles
simply
they
require
speculation,
they
require
a
guess.
this
suggestion
that
there
is
a
case
somewhere
and
mind
you
it
hasn't
been
pointed
out
yet
where
the
commission
would
have
a
lesser
burden,
we
submit
may
very
well
not
exist.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
my
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
black
is
that
it
did
not
obliterate
any
old
orders.
it
simply
–-
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
unless
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
a
petition
had
previously
been
filed
to
review
or
in
force.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
our
answer
--
we
accept
the
government's
figures.
they
said
that
there
are
roughly
400.
now
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
mr.
justice
black
i've
just
had
made
myself
clear,
it's
my
fault.
we
submit
that
anything
of
value
in
those
proceedings
has
been
preserved.
we
submit
that
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
if
something
that's
raised
res
judicata
is
res
judicata
as
commissioner
eleanor
points.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
those
orders
being
those--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well,
commissioner
eleanor
suggested
that
they
can
take
–-
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
commission
will
not
be.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes.
to
go
back
to
justice
white
question
if
i
may
and
it's
my
lack
of
articulacy,
i'm
not
trying
to
run
away
from
any
question.
the
--
if
you
take
any
particular
case
in
which
the
commission
might
want
to
enforce
an
old
order
i
submit
to
the
court
if
you
analyze
it
they
are
just
as
well
or
better
off
under
the
new
procedure.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
congress--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
if
you
take
the
senate
committee
report
which
the
government
has
reproduced.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
if
i—-
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
the
commission
came
to
the
congress
prior
to
19--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
what
i
am
resisting
mr.
justice
black
is
the
conclusion
that
anything
was
wiped
out.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
first
of
all
they
can
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes
sir
it
can.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
in
the
ruberoid
case,
national
led
case,
all
those
cases
where
a
petition
to
review
had
been
filed
prior
to
1959,
and
they
are
all
preserved.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
only,
sure.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i
submit
that
they
are
not.
for
example
take
a
case
maybe
like
national
life
where
there
were
some
fencing
in,
but
the
respondent
did
not
petition
for
review
and
prior
to
1959
no
petition
for
enforcement
was
filed.
so
that
on
the
face
of
the
1959
act
we
have
a
case
now
in
which
in
a
sense
we
might
say
the
old
order
is
wiped
out.
here
is
what
i
suggest
that
you
keep
in
mind.
as
to
that
case,
the
commission
has
the
record,
it
has
the
findings,
which
are
just
as
valid
as
the
other
were
and
by
–
well
if
they
start
a
new
proceeding,
secondly
if
you
are
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
but
they'll
have
to
do
that
even
if
the
old
provisions
were
preserved,
but
let
me
if
i
may
take
that
hypothetically,
which
i
submit
is
a
hypothetical.
the
government
has
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
my
answer
is
simply
that
you
analyze
that
effectiveness,
it
disappears
that
these
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
but
if
you
are
down
to
those
cases
you
find
and
in
contrast
what
the
commission
has
to
do
under
the
provisions
of
law
that
used
to
apply
with
what
we'd
have
to
do
under
the
new
procedure
i
submit
there
isn't
a
great,
there
isn't
a
significant
amount
of
difference.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
if
you
compare
it
with
what
they
had
to
do
under
the
old
statute
that
in
a
sense
was,
you
concede
the
same
document
if
–
but
i'm
not,
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well
if
you
take
one
of
these
cases
mr.
justice
black
which
they,
where
they
say
there
was
some
fencing
in
or
where
they
say
there
was
some
issue
and
where
no
review
or
a
court
presentation
had
been
an
issue.
take
a
case
like
that,
even
if
the
old
provisions
of
law
were
still
in
effect
the
commission
has
to
give
notice,
has
to
have
a
hearing,
has
to
make
a
finding
of
violation
and
then
when
it
petitions
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
has
to
satisfy
the
court
of
appeals
not
only
that
the
order
has
been
violated,
but
that
the
original,
the
finding
of
fact
in
the
old
proceeding
were
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
that
the
conclusions
of
all
in
that
proceeding
were
correct
and
that
the
scope
of
the
order
in
that
proceeding
was
appropriate.
now
we
submit
that
that's
all
litigation
that's
still
opened
to
occur
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
well,
we
argued
two
other
things
in
addition
to
this
point
which
is
a
threshold
one.
one
that
that
the
commissions
order
was
not
valid
in
this
proceeding
in
the
original
proceeding
and
secondly
that
if
it
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
exercising
its
jurisdiction
if
it
was
going
to
assume
it
should
not
properly
in
this
case
order
enforcement.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
reach
those
questions.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
yes
sir.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
the
commission
couldn't,
couldn't
start
with
any
more
unchallenged
facts
one
way
or
other
in
our
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
that's
our
position,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i
don't
agree
with
anything
that
the
commissioner
elanor
--
mr.
edwin
s.
rockefeller
i
see
my
time
is
supposed
to
be
up
and
i
would
like
if
i
may
just
try
to
bring
the
attention
back
to
this
one
question.
if
the
government's
argument
of
statutory
construction
here
what
statute
is
it
arguing
should
be
construed
and
what
words
in
what
statute
should
be
construed
in
what
way
to
come
out
with
any
result
other
than
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
i
submit
that
question
as
i
never
even
been
hinted
at
in
any
of
the
government's
briefs
or
oral
arguments.
secondly
i
do
want
to
try
to
comeback
to
the
second
circuit.
the
second
circuit
we
submit
simply
misunderstood
this,
the
issue.
first
of
all
they
had
a
case
before,
the
second
circuit
had
a
case
before
it
in
which
the
terms
of
section
two
of
the
1959
act
explicitly
applied
and
they
said
so.
and
then
they
went
on
gratuitously
to
state
that
they
didn't
like
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here
because
and
they
don't
say
what
they
would,
they
don't
say
how
they
would
construe
the
statute
otherwise
they
just
say
we
don't
like
this
result
because
it
disregards
two
factors
and
then
the
two
factors
they
state
are
simply
not
correct.
they
misunderstood
the,
in
the
sense
of
the
non-enforceability
of
the
orders
issued
prior
1959
no
matter
which
methods
or
procedure
apply
and
they
went
on
just
to
conclude
that
well
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
somehow
inconsistent
with
some
vague
general
intention
of
congress
and
we
submit
to
you
that
that's
not
correct,
that's
not,
they
didn't
need
to
do
that
and
they
were
wrong
in
doing
so.
and
as
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
those
cases
there,
question
wasn't
before
them
at
all.
in
those
cases
the
court
was
simply
reviewing
the
commission's
attempt
by
blanket
[voice
overlap]
to
give
automatic
penalty
within
60
days
of
the
passage
of
the
1959
act
to
all
lawyers.
and
actually
counsel
in
that
case
was
not
trying
to
take
on
an
added
burden
when
they
said
the
commission
can't
do
this.
now
the
commission
when
that
--
there
was
no
petition
for
certiorari
from
those
dc
cases
and
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
it
attempted
to
blanket
in
all
these
old
orders
in
a
way
that
that
the
contrast
between
the
wheeler-lea
amendments
and
the
1959
amendments
just
simply
wouldn't
permit.
it
was
rebuffed
on
that.
rather
than
go
back
to
congress
they
then
come
along
at
some
later
year
and
try
to
get
the
courts
now
to
just
straighten
and
rewrite
the
1959
act.
now
why
are
1959
act
and
why
was
it
written
that
way,
for
one
thing
we
submit
because
the
commission
at
that
time
didn't
point
out
any
of
these
possible
horribles
that
it's
arguing
now.
if
you
look
inside
the
keith
travis
(ph)
committee
reports,
it's
clear
that
the
understanding
of
that
committee
was
you
had
approved
three
violations
of
law
to
achieve
anything.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
