mr.
richard
b.
hooper
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
case
of
a
cascade
metro
gas
company
application,
the
first
got
started
on
october
7,
1965
with
an
application
believed
to
intervene
in
a
procedure
for
divestiture
of
the
pacific
northwest
pipe
line
division
the
el
paso
metro
gas
company
and
the
district
court
of
salt
lake
city.
the
--
ten
days
--
well,
ten
days
later
a
proposal
presented
by
el
paso
for
divestiture
was
filed
and
served
in
hearings
commenced
two
days
later
and
there
--
there
were
number
of
other
intervenors,
commissions,
private
parties,
applicants
for
intervention
i
should
correctly
say.
now
the
court
ordered
that
all
would
be
interveners
file
memoranda
of
evidence,
law
and
argument
supporting
their
contention
on
intervention.
now
approximately
20
intervenors
--
potential
intervenors,
cascade
metro
gas
company
alone,
complied
with
the
court's
order,
nevertheless,
when
the
court
reached
the
decision
on
intervention.
it
denied
intervention
to
all
parties
by
a
form
order
which
stated
in
part
that
no
evidence
written
oral
had
been
supported
--
had
been
submitted
in
support
of
the
application
for
intervention.
and
subsequently
that
court
adopted
as
its
decision
on
intervention,
the
brief
of
el
paso
filed
an
opposition
to
the
applications
for
intervention.
based
upon
that,
cascade
natural
gas
corporation
filed
notice
of
appeal
at
the
termination
of
hearings
and
then
approximately
the
same
time
that
the
government
filed
a
vigorous,
well
written
brief
in
opposition
to
the
el
paso
proposal
if
anything
to
a
greater
extent
then
to
--
then
to
then
the
extent
to
it
cascade
itself
objective.
now,
cascade
natural
gas
corporation
is
what
may
be
termed
a
growth
company
in
the
pacific
northwest
distributing
natural
gas
in
1963
and
that,
correction,
yes,
1963
to
1962
communities.
three
more
added
in
early
1964
and
had
assets
at
that
time
of
approximately
of
$43
million
rose
plant.
it
had
40,000
customers
by
mid
1964
and
it
was
completely
and
utterly
dependent
upon
a
supply
of
gas
which
had
it
--
it
had
obtained
originally
form
pacific
northwest
pipeline
corporation
under
long
term
contracts
which
were
the
basis
for
very
extensive
financing
to
the
extent
then
of
above
$28
million
and
which
were
assumed
by
el
paso
when
the
merger
occurred.
cascade
natural
gas
corporation
then
did
not
have
and
it
does
not
today,
have
any
other
source
of
gas.
it
must
be
dependent
entirely
on
the
makeup
of
the
new
company
which
is
to
be
the
product
of
the
decree
of
divestiture
as
finally
approved
by
this
court.
to
cascade,
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case
is
simply
this.
is
el
paso
to
be
permitted
to
retain
the
fruits
of
its
initial
and
continued
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws?
whether
to
answer
to
this
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
now,
whether
to
answer
to
this
is
to
be
arrived
at
by
allowing
interested
parties
to
intervene
and
present
critical
evidence
concerning
the
various
provisions
of
this
decree
or
whether
it
is
to
be
decided
by
the
exercise
of
the
plenary
power
of
this
court.
certainly,
we
feel
that
the
questions
that
been
left
unanswered
by
the
decree
as
it
now
stands
and
which
will
have
a
vital
and
adverse
effect
upon
cascade
natural
gas
corporation
to
a
very
considerable
degree
--
degree
and
to
all
customers
in
the
pacific
northwest
to
varying
the
degrees
that
must
be
disposed
of.
now
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
that
may
it
please
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes.
i'll
answer
your
question
your
honor
this
way.
we
feel
there
are
two
distinct
approaches
to
this
problem.
one
is
via
the
question
of
whether
the
court
below
erred
in
denying
intervention
to
all
parties
without
regard
to
their
making
a
prima
facie
case
which
i
might
add
was
never
refuted
by
any
evidence
submitted
in
connection
therewith.
and
the
second
point
is
that
we
are
the
three
in
that
--
the
three
applicants,
the
three
appellants
are
before
the
court
this
day
properly
by
virtue
of
the
expediting
act.
this
is
an
appeal
directly
to
this
court
and
under
the
--
under
mr.
taft
--
mr.
justice
taft's
decision
in
the
continental
case
affirmed
and
relied
upon
in
the
du
pont
case.
you
have
it
within
your
power
to
look
at
this
decree
critically.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
that's
exactly
the
way
we
read
it,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
and
that
the
party
appealing
in
that
case
was
an
intervenor
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
we
feel
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
we
feel
that
mr.
--
that
mr.
justice
taft's
opinion
in
that
case
really
throws
in
almost
as
an
afterthought.
the
idea
that
it
must
be
brought
before
the
court
in
a
proper
way
and
he
does
not
as
mr.
woodbury
has
pointed
out
state
that
it
must
be
brought
by
a
party.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
i
think
that
to
answer
that
question,
we
must
consider
the
context
of
this
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
public
service
company,
the
public
utility
in
the
first
instance
with
divestiture
with
that
has
or
perhaps
even
today
does
delivered
50%
of
the
gas
in
the
entire
country
that
it
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
i
think
that
might
be
disposed
of
your
honor
by
this
court's
refusal
to
note
probable
jurisdiction
in
the
event
of
a
denial
of
intervention
to
such
a
party
and
subsequent
appeal
to
this
court.
now,
this
court
has
not
seen
to
fit
to
do
so.
this
court
has
said
as
far
as
we
are
concern
today,
these
parties
are
properly
before
this
court.
we
want
to
hear
them.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
if
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
--
on
the
question
of
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes,
your
honor.
and
thereafter
when
we
knew
the
terms
of
the
proposed
decree,
we
file
the
supplemental
jurisdictional
statement
drawing
the
court's
attention
to
its
plenary
power.
so
that
by
that
we
feel
that
this
question
is
properly
before
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
but
you
are
not
going
beyond
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
--
the
decisions
require
not
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
we
think
this
case
cries
out
for
such
action.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
that
is
one
of
the
two
questions.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes.
that
is
true
with
respect
to
intervention
but
when
they
--
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
it
said,
“these
people
are
properly
before
this
court.
if
we
are
properly
before
this
court
in
any
matter
whatsoever,
we
can
suggest,
recommend
to
this
court
that
if
exercise
plenary
power
with
respect
to
a
former
order
of
this
court
and
that
i
think
--
that
is
our
dual
position
and
if
you
will.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
i
--
i
believe
that
is
an
element
in
the
case
but
i
think
that
supports
our
position.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
once
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
this
type
and
my
new
--
we
restrict
our
proposition
to
this
type
of
case
where
there
is
a
prior
order
of
divestiture
and
the
question
is
as
the
mandate
of
this
court
improperly
carried
out.
now,
consider
it
if
you
will
for
just
a
moment.
the
alternate
--
the
alternative
is
that
regardless
of
what
the
government
sees
fit
to
do
in
a
case
of
this
kind
on
hearings
to
carry
out
the
order
of
this
court.
the
court
is
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it.
now,
i
--
now,
we
submit
that
this
simply
should
not
be
the
rule
of
law.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
no,
sir.
we
wouldn't.
and
if
we
wouldn
--
we
would
argue
exactly
the
same
way
so
long
as
we
before
this
court
is
all
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
that
--
that's
our
position.
now
just
a
brief
word
if
you
will
about
the
--
about
this
decree,
all
the
way
through
this
decree
after
the
final
execution
of
it,
the
final
issuance
of
it
is
the
product
of
el
paso
with
one
exception.
the
--
the
government
forced
a
concession
on
the
question
of
spin
off
that
the
government
made
it
--
made
a
substantial
concession
itself
throughout
the
hearings.
the
government
argued
for
a
sale,
outright
sale.
the
government
conceded
that.
the
government
abandoned
all
other
controversies
which
it
--
all
other
considerations
which
have
said
were
important.
now,
to
cascade
the
matter
of
vital
importance
is
does
this
decree
reconstitute
a
company
with
a
reserve
position
of
the
old
pacific
northwest
pipe
line
corporation
and
we
submit
it
falls
far
short
of
doing
so.
it
--
it
will
create
substitute
a
marginal
company
for
a
company
that
had
five
greater
reserves
and
deliverability
like
in
el
paso
itself.
not
even
capable
of
providing
for
the
foreseeable
growth
in
the
pacific
northwest
let
alone
capable
of
providing
any
gas
to
the
state
of
california.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
case
of
a
cascade
metro
gas
company
application,
the
first
got
started
on
october
7,
1965
with
an
application
believed
to
intervene
in
a
procedure
for
divestiture
of
the
pacific
northwest
pipe
line
division
the
el
paso
metro
gas
company
and
the
district
court
of
salt
lake
city.
the
--
ten
days
--
well,
ten
days
later
a
proposal
presented
by
el
paso
for
divestiture
was
filed
and
served
in
hearings
commenced
two
days
later
and
there
--
there
were
number
of
other
intervenors,
commissions,
private
parties,
applicants
for
intervention
i
should
correctly
say.
now
the
court
ordered
that
all
would
be
interveners
file
memoranda
of
evidence,
law
and
argument
supporting
their
contention
on
intervention.
now
approximately
20
intervenors
--
potential
intervenors,
cascade
metro
gas
company
alone,
complied
with
the
court's
order,
nevertheless,
when
the
court
reached
the
decision
on
intervention.
it
denied
intervention
to
all
parties
by
a
form
order
which
stated
in
part
that
no
evidence
written
oral
had
been
supported
--
had
been
submitted
in
support
of
the
application
for
intervention.
and
subsequently
that
court
adopted
as
its
decision
on
intervention,
the
brief
of
el
paso
filed
an
opposition
to
the
applications
for
intervention.
based
upon
that,
cascade
natural
gas
corporation
filed
notice
of
appeal
at
the
termination
of
hearings
and
then
approximately
the
same
time
that
the
government
filed
a
vigorous,
well
written
brief
in
opposition
to
the
el
paso
proposal
if
anything
to
a
greater
extent
then
to
--
then
to
then
the
extent
to
it
cascade
itself
objective.
now,
cascade
natural
gas
corporation
is
what
may
be
termed
a
growth
company
in
the
pacific
northwest
distributing
natural
gas
in
1963
and
that,
correction,
yes,
1963
to
1962

and
had

time
of

of

it
had
40,000
customers
by
mid
1964
and
it
was
completely
and
utterly
dependent
upon

which
had

it
had
obtained

which
were
the

then
did

it
must
be

on

to

the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case
is
simply
this.
is
el

to
be
permitted
to
retain
the
fruits
of
its
initial
and
continued
violation
of
the

laws?
whether
to
answer

this
--
mr.

now,
whether

is
to
be
arrived
at
by
allowing

certainly,
we
feel
that
the
questions
that
been
left
unanswered
by
the
decree
as
it
now
stands
and
which
will
have
a
vital
and
adverse
effect
upon

considerable
degree
--
degree
and
to

to

that

be
disposed

now
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
that
may
it
please
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes.
i'll
answer
your
question
your
honor
this
way.
we
feel
there
are
two
distinct
approaches
to
this
problem.
one
is
via
the
question
of
whether
the
court
below
erred
in
denying

to
all

without

to
their
making

which
i
might
add
was
never
refuted
by
any

and
the
second
point
is
that
we
are
the
three
in
that
--
the
three
applicants,
the
three
appellants
are
before
the
court
this
day
properly
by
virtue
of
the
expediting
act.
this
is
an
appeal
directly
to
this
court
and
under
the
--
under
mr.
taft
--
mr.
justice
taft's
decision
in
the
continental
case
affirmed
and
relied
upon
in
the
du
pont
case.
you
have
it
within
your
power
to
look
at
this
decree
critically.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
that's
exactly
the
way
we
read
it,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
and
that
the
party
appealing
in
that
case
was
an
intervenor
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
we
feel
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
we
feel
that
mr.
--
that
mr.
justice
taft's
opinion
in
that
case
really
throws
in
almost
as
an
afterthought.
the
idea
that
it
must
be
brought
before
the
court
in
a
proper
way
and
he
does
not
as
mr.
woodbury
has
pointed
out
state
that
it
must
be
brought
by
a
party.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
i
think
that
to
answer
that
question,
we
must
consider
the
context
of
this
case.
we're
dealing
with
a
public
service
company,
the
public
utility
in
the
first
instance
with
divestiture
with
that
has
or
perhaps
even
today
does
delivered
50%
of
the
gas
in
the
entire
country
that
it
is
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
i
think
that
might
be
disposed
of
your
honor
by
this
court's
refusal
to
note
probable
jurisdiction
in
the
event
of
a
denial
of
intervention
to
such
a
party
and
subsequent
appeal
to
this
court.
now,
this
court
has
not
seen
to
fit
to
do
so.
this
court
has
said
as
far
as
we
are
concern
today,
these
parties
are
properly
before
this
court.
we
want
to
hear
them.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
if
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
--
on
the
question
of
that
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes,
your
honor.
and
thereafter
when
we
knew
the
terms
of
the
proposed
decree,
we
file
the
supplemental
jurisdictional
statement
drawing
the
court's
attention
to
its
plenary
power.
so
that
by
that
we
feel
that
this
question
is
properly
before
the
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
but
you
are
not
going
beyond
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
--
the
decisions
require
not
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
we
think
this
case
cries
out
for
such
action.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
that
is
one
of
the
two
questions.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes.
that
is
true
with
respect
to
intervention
but
when
they
--
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
it
said,
“these
people
are
properly
before
this
court.
if
we
are
properly
before
this
court
in
any
matter
whatsoever,
we
can
suggest,
recommend
to
this
court
that
if
exercise
plenary
power
with
respect
to
a
former
order
of
this
court
and
that
i
think
--
that
is
our
dual
position
and
if
you
will.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
i
--
i
believe
that
is
an
element
in
the
case
but
i
think
that
supports
our
position.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
once
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
this
type
and
my
new
--
we
restrict
our
proposition
to
this
type
of
case
where
there
is
a
prior
order
of
divestiture
and
the
question
is
as
the
mandate
of
this
court
improperly
carried
out.
now,
consider
it
if
you
will
for
just
a
moment.
the
alternate
--
the
alternative
is
that
regardless
of
what
the
government
sees
fit
to
do
in
a
case
of
this
kind
on
hearings
to
carry
out
the
order
of
this
court.
the
court
is
powerless
to
do
anything
about
it.
now,
i
--
now,
we
submit
that
this
simply
should
not
be
the
rule
of
law.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
no,
sir.
we
wouldn't.
and
if
we
wouldn
--
we
would
argue
exactly
the
same
way
so
long
as
we
before
this
court
is
all
--
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
b.
hooper
that
--
that's
our
position.
now
just
a
brief
word
if
you
will
about
the
--
about
this
decree,
all
the
way
through
this
decree
after
the
final
execution
of
it,
the
final
issuance
of
it
is
the
product
of
el
paso
with
one
exception.
the
--
the
government
forced
a
concession
on
the
question
of
spin
off
that
the
government
made
it
--
made
a
substantial
concession
itself
throughout
the
hearings.
the
government
argued
for
a
sale,
outright
sale.
the
government
conceded
that.
the
government
abandoned
all
other
controversies
which
it
--
all
other
considerations
which
have
said
were
important.
now,
to
cascade
the
matter
of
vital
importance
is
does
this
decree
reconstitute
a
company
with
a
reserve
position
of
the
old
pacific
northwest
pipe
line
corporation
and
we
submit
it
falls
far
short
of
doing
so.
it
--
it
will
create
substitute
a
marginal
company
for
a
company
that
had
five
greater
reserves
and
deliverability
like
in
el
paso
itself.
not
even
capable
of
providing
for
the
foreseeable
growth
in
the
pacific
northwest
let
alone
capable
of
providing
any
gas
to
the
state
of
california.
thank
you.
