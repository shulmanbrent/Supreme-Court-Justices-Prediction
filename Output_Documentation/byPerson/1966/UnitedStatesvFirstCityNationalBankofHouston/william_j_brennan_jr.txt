i
gather
--
i
--
that
provision
being
that
they're
not
merely
that
the
comptroller
was
wrong
in
his
determination,
but
affirmatively
to
establish
by

that

--
that
negative
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes,
that's
what
–-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
--
what
you
said
but
what
i'm

justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
what
i'm
--
that
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
ask
you
the
right
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

now,
what
under
that
--
what
under
that
view
is
the
significance
of
the
determination
of
the
comptroller?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
suppose
mr.
turner
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
the
statute
is
read
as
setting
up
a
review
standard
nothing
more.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
--
then
(inaudible)
they
answered
on
the
basis
whether
it's
to
be
a
review
of
anything
except
the
determination
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
turner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
my
recollection
accurate,
that
the
--
this
provision
reviewed
de
novo
come
really
from
a
proposal
of
the
attorney
general
by
letter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
didn't
that
letter
suggest
that
the
provision
provide
for
a
trial
de
novo?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
do
we
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
have
any
history
of
why
the
choice
of
the
word
review
rather
than
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

incidentally
is
the
power
to
correct.

william

well,
i

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i

justice
william

i
guess
will
ultimately
with
the
statutes
which
provides
the
trial
de
novo
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
but
isn't
the
expression
of
review
de
novo
unusual?
do
you
know
of
--
do
you
any
other
statutes
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
proposal
would
have
planned
a
review

justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
within
the
confines
of
the
record
made
before
the
agency.
justice
william
j.

well,
if
we
could

justice
william
j.
brennan,

well

and
ordinarily
in
an

is
the

is
it
that
that
kind
of
review
you
think
the

proposal
contemplates?
justice

it
contemplates.
justice
william

was
that
when
they've
suggested

well,
under

how
much
weight
is

so
what
(voice

--
justice
william

if
the
evidence
would
be
put
in
and
then
under
the
government's
view
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
a
banking
agency
would
have
to
produce
some
evidence
not
merely
that
this
is
our
determination
based
on
certain
facts.
we
applied
to
our
expertise
and
reached
this
conclusion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
concretely,
as
i
recall
it,
there's
a
rather
detailed,
and
indeed
supplemental,
even
more
detailed
explanation
of
the
grounds
upon
which
the
comptroller
reached
the
conclusions
he
did.
now,
would
all
of
that
have
to
be
the
subject
of
evidence
or
would
he
be
simply
permitted
to
come
in
and
testify,
"these
are
the
things
that
we
considered."

a

i'm

well,
it
does
seem
to
me
what
the
--
that
this
really
is
saying
that
the
--
all
of
the
issues
are
retried,
would
all
of
that
means
on

way
of
evidential

justice
william
j.

have
not
been

justice
william

mr.

may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
ask
a
question.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
government's
position
really
reducing
the
agency
in
the
proceeding
in
court
pretty
much
to
the
role
of
an
expert
witness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
that
you
say
that
the
congress
really
intended
to
have
the
courts,
as
an
original
matter,
apply
the
standards
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
bank
merger
act,
including
the
needs
of
the
community.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
you
hope.
you
hope.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you're
hoping
we'll
reach
it
in
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
an
argument
mr.
searls,
i
gather
that
they
can't
plead
any
cause
of
action
in
the
bank
merger
case
except
by
reference
to
the
bank
merger
statute
itself.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
occurred
to
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
omission
of
in
any
line
of
commerce
in
and
of
itself
makes
in
a
bank
merger
case
an
antitrust
aspect,
entirely
one
under
the
bank
merger
act
without
reference
to
the
clayton
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
hold
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
this
is
to
say
then
that
under
the
bank
merger
act,
the
--
this
pleading
is
wholly
defective
because
there's
no
reference
to
the
bank
merger
act
but
only
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
section
7.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
indeed
she
goes
so
far
as
the
state
merely
because
they
mention
section
7.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
very
reference,
the
section
7
i
thought
you
were
arguing
is
that
--
is
self-established
as
if
they
are
not
alleging
the
court's
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
mr.
searls.
do
i
--
i
thought
your
argument
was
they
couldn't
plead
any
cause
of
action
except
predicated
on
the
bank
merger
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
an
argument?
the
bank
merger
act
actually
supplants
section
7.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
no
cause
of
action
predicated
on
--
that
the
bank
merger
on
section
7,
you
say
a
good
cause
of
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
can't
approve
it
or
would
you
just
take
your
examiner
as
an
expert
witness

be
described
as
sampling
techniques

justice

might
not,
but
they
might
allow
him
to

was

predicate
of
his
expert
judgment
if
the
interest
of
the

requires
a
merger.

it
seems,
mr.

is
there
a
difference
between

and
the
comptroller
in
the
nature
of
the
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
rather
have
the
impression
from
mr.
metzger's
argument,
the
comptroller's
view
was,
so
long
as
the
limit
of
four
corners
or
whatever
it
is
the
comptroller
relied
upon,
just
support
his
determination
and
that's
as
far
as
this
court
can
go.
the
court
can't
make
redetermination
of
facts,
perhaps,
i'm
wrong.

you're
satisfied
with
that?

outlines
of

what

view
in

j.
brennan,

well,
the
--
your
constitutional
argument,
i
gather.
justice
william

if
the
act
can't
go
further
than
what
you
are
about
--
rather
tell

well,
i
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
i
think
that's
--
justice
william

brennan,

--
the
ordinary
agency
review.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
about
the
--
and
you
did
(inaudible),
that
was
--
i
thought
that
if
you
believe
that
on
the
issue
of
convenience

needs,
the
court
might
take
evidence

independently
arrive
at
some
of
the
underlying
facts
its

on

you
don't
have

no,
do
you

they

allow
you,
(inaudible).
you're
telling
me
now
that
yes,
even
on
convenience
and
needs,
the
comptroller's
determination
at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
underlying
facts
may
be
the
subject
of
independent
evidence
on
new
determination
of
those
underlying

by

justice

is
that
what
you're
saying
may
be
done?
justice

i'm
trying
to
discover
what
the

what's
the
constitutional
argument
is;
it
comes
to
me
--
justice

--
you
gave

away?

will
you

how
--
you
simply
need
--
neither
of

have
you
had
a

this
is
what

dealt

the
failure
to
have

in

the

it

why
don't

that's
neither
of
these
cases
was
of
a

justice
william

what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
you're
following
smithfield
accurately,
smithfield
found
that
the
determination,
the

determination
was
appropriate
since
in
fact
your
branch
determination,
whatever
that
was
there,
was
not

you

what

if
the

then
under
the
government's
view

justice
william

a
banking
agency
would
have
to
produce
some
evidence
not
merely
that
this
is
our
determination
based
on
certain
facts.
we
applied
to
our
expertise
and
reached
this
conclusion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
concretely,
as
i
recall
it,
there's
a
rather
detailed,
and
indeed
supplemental,
even
more
detailed
explanation
of
the
grounds
upon
which
the
comptroller
reached
the
conclusions
he
did.
now,
would
all
of
that
have
to
be
the
subject
of
evidence
or
would
he
be
simply
permitted
to
come
in
and
testify,
"these
are
the
things
that
we
considered."

it
does
seem
to
me
what
the
--
that
this
really
is
saying
that
the
--
all
of
the
issues
are
retried,
would
all
of
that

on

justice
william

have
not

justice

mr.

may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
ask
a
question.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
government's
position
really
reducing
the
agency
in
the
proceeding
in
court
pretty
much
to
the
role
of
an
expert
witness.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
that
you
say
that
the
congress
really
intended
to
have
the
courts,
as
an
original
matter,
apply
the
standards
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
bank
merger
act,
including
the
needs
of
the
community.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
you
hope.
you
hope.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you're
hoping
we'll
reach
it
in
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
an
argument
mr.
searls,
i
gather
that
they
can't
plead
any
cause
of
action
in
the
bank
merger
case
except
by
reference
to
the
bank
merger
statute
itself.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
occurred
to
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
omission
of
in
any
line
of
commerce
in
and
of
itself
makes
in
a
bank
merger
case
an
antitrust
aspect,
entirely
one
under
the
bank
merger
act
without
reference
to
the
clayton
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
hold
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
this
is
to
say
then
that
under
the
bank
merger
act,
the
--
this
pleading
is
wholly
defective
because
there's
no
reference
to
the
bank
merger
act
but
only
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
section
7.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
indeed
she
goes
so
far
as
the
state
merely
because
they
mention
section
7.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
very
reference,
the
section
7
i
thought
you
were
arguing
is
that
--
is
self-established
as
if
they
are
not
alleging
the
court's
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
mr.
searls.
do
i
--
i
thought
your
argument
was
they
couldn't
plead
any
cause
of
action
except
predicated
on
the
bank
merger
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
an
argument?
the
bank
merger
act
actually
supplants
section
7.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
therefore,
no
cause
of
action
predicated
on
--
that
the
bank
merger
on
section
7,
you
say
a
good
cause
of
action.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
can't
approve
it
or
would
you
just
take
your
examiner
as
an
expert
witness
and
be
described
as
sampling
techniques

among

justice

they
might
not,
but
they
might
allow
him
to

was
the
predicate
of
his
expert
judgment
if
the
interest
of
the
community
requires
a
merger.

aren't

(voice

well
it
seems,
mr.

is
there
a
difference
between
you
and
the
comptroller
in
the
nature
of
the
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
rather
have
the
impression
from
mr.
metzger's
argument,
the
comptroller's
view
was,
so
long
as
the
limit
of
four
corners
or
whatever
it
is
the
comptroller
relied
upon,
just
support
his
determination
and
that's
as
far
as
this
court
can
go.
the
court
can't
make
redetermination
of
facts,
perhaps,
i'm
wrong.
justice

you're
satisfied
with
that?

outlines
of

what
was

role
in
your
view
in
convenience

j.
brennan,

well,
the
--
your
constitutional
argument,
i
gather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

if
the
act
can't
go
further
than
what
you
are
about
--
rather
tell

no

to

justice
william

well,
i
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
i
think
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
the
ordinary
agency
review.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
about
the
--
and
you
did
(inaudible),
that
was
--
i
thought
that
if
you
believe
that
on
the
issue
of
convenience
and
needs,
the
court
might
take
evidence
and
independently
arrive
at
some
of
the
underlying
facts
its

on
convenience

you
don't
have

do
you
not
agree
with
that?

no,
do
you

yes,
but
they
--

allow
you,
(inaudible).
you're
telling
me
now
that
yes,
even
on
convenience
and
needs,
the
comptroller's
determination
at
least
to
the
extent
of
the
underlying
facts
may
be
the
subject
of
independent
evidence
on
new
determination
of
those
underlying
facts
by
the

justice

is
that
what
you're
saying
may
be
done?
justice

i'm
trying
to
discover
what
the

what's
the
constitutional
argument
is;
it
comes
to
me
--
justice

--
you
gave

away?

will
you

how
--
you
simply
need

neither
of

have
you

this
is
what

dealt
with,
right?

the
failure
to
have

in

the

it

why
don't

doesn't
the

followed
smithfield?
that's
neither
of
these
cases
was
of
a

hearing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
you're
following
smithfield
accurately,
smithfield
found
that
the
determination,
the
judicial
determination
was
appropriate
since
in
fact
your
branch
determination,
whatever
that
was
there,
was
not
made

done

basis
of
any

you
have
