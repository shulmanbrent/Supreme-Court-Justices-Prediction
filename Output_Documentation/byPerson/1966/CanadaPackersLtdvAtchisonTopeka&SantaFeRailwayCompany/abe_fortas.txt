where
a

company
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
through
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
can
you
tell
us
something
about
the
--
how
the
arrangements
were

for
this
transportation?
did
you
--
is
this
covered
just
transportation
from
new

to
canada
of
both
--
justice
abe
fortas
both
directions?
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
it's
only
from
new

justice
abe
fortas
i
see
and
the
carriers
here
was
arranged
with
the
united
states
carrier,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
role
did
the
petitioner
play
in
arranging
for
the
potash
to
be
transported?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
and
to
whom
did
you
make
that
payment,
was
it
to
the
canadian
carrier?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
paid
the
canadian
carrier
when
the
potash
was
delivered
in
canada?
justice
abe
fortas
and
then
presumably
the
canadian
carrier
made
a
division
with
the
us
carrier?
justice
abe
fortas
and
now
you're
suing
the
u.s.
carrier
if
theory
of
that
you
can
recover
the
entire
over
payment?
justice
abe
fortas
could
you
have
sued
the
canadian

justice
abe
fortas
of

you
could
have
sued
them
in

and
to
your
canadian
accomplices
--
canadian
carrier?
justice
abe
fortas
you
could
sued
them
in

--
justice
abe
fortas
will
you
tell
us
what
the
rule
would
it
been
to
canada
with
respect
to
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
major
recovery
of
any
or
what
the
rules
would
have
been
there?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
part
when
the
icc
determinations
have
played
in
that
action
if
any?
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
--
well,
none
of
this
gathers
that
--
this
is
not
a
situation
in
order
that
united
states
carrier
received
the
total
amount
of
what
is
not
claim
in
the
over
payment
of
the
rights?
justice
abe
fortas
they
didn't
receive
it
but
you
nevertheless
seeking
the
recovery
from?
justice
abe
fortas
nor
did
they
receive
a
total
alleged
double
payment?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
you'd
know
that
at
least
that's
reasonable
--
is
the
reasonable
statement
if
you
disregard
and
then
principle
of
allocation.
where
here
in
since
it's
been
--
justice
abe
fortas
there's
a
canadian
carrier
that
receive
a
money
initially
and
then,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
accounted
to
the
american
carrier
on
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
to
this.
justice
abe
fortas
why
is
an
american
company,
the
u.s.
company,
would
assume
where
they
rates
paying
in
the
united
states
to
the
american
carrier
or
where
they
paid
in
canada
that's
in
your
case
to
the
canadian
carrier?
justice
abe
fortas
was
that
computed
on
the
basis
of
the
rates
from
by
the
icc
to
be
proper?
the
way
it
shows?
justice
abe
fortas
explain
that?
what
about
the
21%?
justice
abe
fortas
as
it
has
been
divided
by
agreement
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
the
country?
justice
abe
fortas
are
you
saying
that
in
the
previous
cases
--
you're
saying
in
the
previous
cases
that
there
had
been
a
maximum
rate
for
u.s.
portion
of
the
court
that
the
result
in
those
cases
would
have
been
different?
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
anything
in
those
cases
if
anything
the
court's
opinion
in
those
cases
to
the
effect
that
words
arriving
at
this
result,
is
because
it
can't
do
any
better?
justice
abe
fortas
but
there's
no
indication
in
our
--
in
this
court's
previous
decision
that
we
have
that
this
court
arrived
at
each
result
because
it
did
not
have
information
or
standard
that
it
need
to
arrive
with
the
--
in
others?
justice
abe
fortas
what
difference
opinion
principle
would
that
make
as
your
view?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
the
commission
here
established
a
maximum
permissible
rate
on
approved
basis
through
the
international
rate?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
would
the
availability
of
the
u.s.
rate
to
carlsbad
-
detroit
rate
maintain
a
difference,
i'm
having
trouble
seeing
that?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
does
it
show
that
the
standard's
right
why
the
standard
runs
on
the
understanding
because
the
maximum
international
through
rates
also
standard
then
there
are
question
which
one
is
--
was
commissioned
permitted
to
choose?
justice
abe
fortas
why
--
isn't
the
standard
be
more
costly
to
the
railroad?
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
what
is
the
reason
in
the
law
or
i'm
saying
to
the
icc
that
in
this
situation
where
you
had
two
standards,
two
maximum
permissible
rates?
one
us,
one
international,
that
you
have
to
take
the
domestic
rather
than
the
international?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
if
that
i'm
trying
to
find
out
why
we
should
decide
one
rather
than
the
other.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
lead
you
to
an
attack
on
the
whole
practice
of
the
commission
approval
of
maximum
rates
for
international
food
traffic?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
know
is
that
necessarily
inconsistent?
here
is
as
i
understand
it
or
what
happen
is
that
the
commission
did
establish
in
some
form
a
1380
rate,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
only,
i
think
so
when
it
comes
to
that
--
that's
in
the
brief,
i
think.
that's
was
send
in
the
effect
of
its
action
and
i
believe
when
it
said
that
the
maximum
increase
is
a
$1.60.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
it
is
your
point
that
since
it
cannot
prescribe
a
rate
as
to
the
through
that
international
rate,
it
can
make
no
judgment
as
to
the
--
through
international
rate
or
it
is
your
point
that
since
it
can
prescribe
no
--
through
international
rate.
although,
it
can
make
a
judgment
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
that
rate,
you
say
it
cannot
compel
the
american
carrier
to
this
court.
do
you
--
do
i
make
myself
clear?
justice
abe
fortas
so
what
you
--
justice
abe
fortas
right.
well,
that's
would
i
thought
because
i
thought
that
logically
our
position
really
cut
more
deeply
than
i
understood
your
brief
to
say,
logically
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
goes
beyond
that
position
that
the
commission
cannot
make
a
judgment
as
to
the
unreasonableness
of
the
international
through
rate
and
then
compel
the
american
carrier
to
pay
only
the
american
portion
of
it.
logically,
if
i
correctly
understand
you,
your
position
would
leave
to
the
conclusion
that
the
commission
just
can't
say
that
the
international
rate
as
such
is
unreasonable.
but
as
to
consider
the
us
segment
and
the
us
segment
only
both
in
terms
of
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness
and
in
terms
of
reparations.
justice
abe
fortas
if
that's
all
this
discussion
in
your
brief
about
the
way
that
go
about
this
job
is
the
sad
point,
isn't
it?
that
is
to
say
then
that
were
so
all
the
information
would
do
if
they
to
make
a
judgment
of
what
is
the
reasonable
made
under
us
segment
compel
the
us
carrier
to
pay
the
difference
and
you
wouldn't
to
have
an
allocation
such
as
you
suggests?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
that
would
surprise
you
--
that
would
surprise
you?
justice
abe
fortas
but
the
contract
carries
so
to
speak
is
made
in
this
country,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
that
you
have
a
u.s.
ship
and
a
u.s.
carrier
here
and
they
enter
into
a
contract
carriage
on
the
potash
from
carlsbad
or
wherever
it
is
to
canada
and
the
let
us
also
assume
which
is
not
this
case
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
freight
is
prepaid
and
everything
takes
place
in
this
country.
and
the
rate
has
been
posted
by
the
carrier
here.
now,
is
there
anything
about
carrier
being
responsible
for
the
just
–
justness
and
reasonableness
in
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
anything
in
our
governmental
theory
that
runs
--
come
into
that?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
bothers
me
in
this
case.
but
then
the
fact
principle
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
goods
are
damaged
on
the
canadian
sector
of
the
trip,
the
shipper
nevertheless
has
some
action
against
the
u.s.
carrier,
does
he
not?
justice
abe
fortas
where
a
canadian
company
--
justice
abe
fortas
and
through
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
can
you
tell
us
something
about
the

of

abe
fortas
both
directions?
justice
abe
fortas
i
guess
it's
only
from
new
mexico?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see
and
the
carriers
here
was
arranged
with
the
united
states
carrier,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what

did
the

play

fortas
well,
(voice

and
then
presumably
the

made

you're
suing
the

carrier
if
theory

that
you
can
recover
the

over

justice
abe
fortas
could
you
have
sued
the

justice

of

you

you

well,
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
that
you
have
a
u.s.
ship
and
a
u.s.
carrier
here
and
they
enter
into
a
contract
carriage
on
the
potash
from
carlsbad
or
wherever
it
is
to
canada
and
the
let
us
also
assume
which
is
not
this
case
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
freight
is
prepaid
and
everything
takes
place
in
this
country.
and
the
rate
has
been
posted
by
the
carrier
here.
now,
is
there
anything
about
carrier
being
responsible
for
the
just
–
justness
and
reasonableness
in
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
anything
in
our
governmental
theory
that
runs
--
come
into
that?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
what
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
bothers
me
in
this
case.
but
then
the
fact
principle
i
think
--
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
goods
are
damaged
on
the
canadian
sector
of
the
trip,
the
shipper
nevertheless
has
some
action
against
the
u.s.
carrier,
does
he
not?
