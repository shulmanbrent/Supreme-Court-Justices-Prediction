mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
that
they
are
as
that
as
a
result
of
the
history
of
expansion
of
the
term
control
and
if
they
are
coextensive
by
reason
of
the
rational
necessity
of
construing
this
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
all
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
we
can't
conceive
of
a
influence
of
one
corporation
on
another
that
would
tend
substantially
to
lessen
competition
that
would
not
also
involve
an
element
of
control
such
as
to
invoke
the
commission's'
jurisdiction
under
section
5.
control
has
become
after
all
a
term
of
art.
it
does
not
mean
majority
control.
only
two
months
ago
the
court
dealt
with
the
case
of
chicago
and
eastern
where
the
commission
had
found
control
a
violation
of
section
5
through
the
acquisition
of
30%
of
the
stock
of
a
railroad.
it
seems
to
me
that
and
i'll
get
back
to
this
that's
the
two
sections
have
to
be
read
as
of
equal
reach
especially
when
you
take
into
account
the
investment
exception
to
section
7.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
certainly
don't
mean
the
same
thing
and
that
they
have
the
same
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
cover
the
same
ground.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
but
they
deal
with
the
problems
in
somewhat
different
ways.
section
7
is
an
absolute
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
under
section
7,
no
one
is
authorized
to
consider
whether
the
lessening
of
competition
may
not
be
over
balanced
by
some
advantage
to
public
interest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
balanced,
bias
whereas
that's
just
what
the
commission
is
required
to
do
under
section
5.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
only
--
the
only
--
well
the
consequence
of
my
adversary's
position
is
that
the
commission
cannot
under
any
circumstances
approve
a
stock
issuance,
an
issuance
of
securities
without
considering
in
advance
any
competitive
anticompetitive
effects
that
might
flow
form
there.
the
ultimate
consequence
of
our
position
is
that
there
maybe
some
cases
and
we
submit
that
this
is
one
where
it's
appropriate
to
deal
with
those
issues
in
sequence.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
want
the
decision
below
affirmed.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
which
authorizes
the
commission
to
postpone
the
section
5?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
it's
a
question
of
timing
in
fact.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
that's
right
they
will
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
would
be
set
aside
until
the
commission
had
considered
the
section
5.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
do
stress
though
that
there
is
every
--
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
as
appellants
have
worried
about
that
they
are
likely
to
be
so
seriously
injured
during
the
period
after
the
tender
offer
is
concluded
before
the
section
5
hearing
to
be
completed.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
first
of
all
any
of
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
at
least
i
don't
think
i
do.
many
of
the
proposed
changes
that
are
sketched
out
in
the
memorandum
of
understanding
that
has
been
referred
to
between
the
two
companies,
many
of
those,
which
as
i
said,
are
still
very
tentative
would
themselves
require
commission
approval.
it
would
also
require
commission
approval
for
officers
of
greyhound
to
place
themselves
on
the
board
of
rea.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
could
do
that
i
suppose,
but
they
would
run
the
very
grave
risk
that
the
commission
would
find
that
they
had
--
the
greyhound
had
achieved
control.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
this
is
imminently
unscramble
[inaudible]
to
me.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
greyhound
can
be
called
upon
to
divest
itself
of
its
stock
and
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
still
stress
that
many
of
the
thoughts
of
consolidation
were
independently
required
commission
approval
in
many
of
other
forms
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
this
is
something
that's
going
to
happen
imminently
and
suddenly
within
those
60
days
before
the
commission
can
begin
to
act
under
section
5.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
isn't
even
so
clear
that
the
money
need
to
go
back
to
greyhound.
the
commission
can
find
that
greyhound
must
divest
itself
of
its
stock
and
can
call
it
a
day.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
those
are
still
prospective
no
one
has
actually
began
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
again
it
seem
to
me
this
is
likely
to
depend
very
heavily
on
what
happens
during
those
60
days
whether
greyhound
will
plan
to
tie
itself
up
intimately
with
a
company,
where
a
majority
of
the
stock
is
owned
by
railroads,
who
are
literally
possible
to
it,
if
southern
pacific
let's
say
exercised
its
right
of
first
refusal,
is
a
dubious
question.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
tender
offer
has
to
be
concluded.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
for
what?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
they
should
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
they
should
--
well
this
is
already
outstanding
stock
so
that
the
stock
that's
to
be
acquired
under
the
tender
offer
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
section
20a
in
any
event.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
it
raises
questions
under
5.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
oh!
no,
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
greyhound
walks
away
with
a
million
shares
of
rea
stock
and
happened
either
sterilize
itself
by
putting
that
stock
in
a
voting
trust
or
come
to
the
commission
for
approval
and
put
in
a
voting
trust
pending
approval
it
is
in
very
grave
difficulty
under
the
act
as
the
gilbertville
case,
central
of
georgia
all
indicate
because
violating
section
5
is
grounds
for
disapproving
the
acquisition
of
control.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
mean
that's
somewhat
awkward
decision
in
that
respect
because
the
government
then
--
the
icc
would
not,
in
harmony
the
government
and
the
icc
were
not
in
harmony.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
there
is
a
very
marked
difference
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission's
action
here
serves
the
purpose
of
enlightened
and
informed
decision
making.
it
knew
that
it
maybe
required
to
proceed
under
section
5
and
it
knows
that
it
doesn't
have
the
information
necessary
to
do
the
balancing
either
from
the
advantageous
point
of
view
or
the
anticompetitive
effect
point
of
view,
doesn't
have
the
information
to
do
that.
now
it
can't
do
its
job
as
i
see
it
effectively
under
section
5
at
this
point,
but
it
refrains
from
boxing
itself
in.
it
didn't
prejudge
the
situation.
it
didn't
commit
itself.
it
let
itself
free
to
terminate
this
whole
thing
as
required.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
can
suggest
maybe
two
or
three
points.
here
we
don't
see
any
difficult
in
unscrambling.
here
we
don't
see
that
the
commission
has
put
itself
in
a
position
which
automatically
forces
its
hand
at
a
later
date.
we
think
the
commission
has
preserved
its
freedom
to
act
at
a
later
date.
i
think
there
is
indeed
this
is
--
it's
almost,
our
position
here
is
similar
in
the
sense
that
under
mr.
dempsey's
view
the
commission
was
required
to
proceed
in
a
sort
of
piecemeal
way.
it
was
supposed
to
analyze
an
acquisition
of
20%
under
section
5
perhaps
or
section
7
and
then
two
months
later
sit
down
again
and
say
well
what
about
60%
or
what
about
50%
or
40%
and
it's
that
sort
of
piecemeal
inefficiency
that
it
seems
to
me
the
commission
quite
properly
avoided
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
greyhound
finds
itself
after
60
days
in
a
position
to
effectuate
the
program
of
consolidation
that
it
so
earnestly
desires
then
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
it
must
insulate
rea
from
its
control
until
the
commission
has
come
to
a
conclusion
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
because
if
they
should
proceed
to
exercise
control
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
but
there
are
great
many
cases
that
say
that
to
–
as
this
court
has
said
that
the
commission
is
free
to
require
divestiture
because
control
has
been
acquired
without
authorization
that
what
was
said
in
gilbertville
and
the
commission
has
done
that
in
another
cases.
so
it
would
be
foolhardy
at
least
for
greyhound
to
proceed
that
way
and
the
commission
has
power
to
prevent
it
from
proceeding
that
way.
it
can
go
into
court
if
need
be
to
enjoin
it
from
proceeding
that
way.
it
can
give
all
sorts
of
provisional
relief,
which
we've
outlined
in
our
brief
to
preserve
the
status
quo
pending
its
ultimate
decision.
but
in
the
normal
course
when
a
company
--
when
one
railroad
picks
up
the
stock
of
another
it
does
take
steps
to
immunize
the
controlled
relationship
until
the
commission
has
the
opportunity
to
exercise
its
expert
judgment
on
whether
to
authorize
it
or
not.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
my
impression
is
things
had
gone
rather
beyond
that
there
but
i'm
really
not
an
expert
on
the
penn
central
situation
and
i'd
be
reluctant
to
give
you
a
off
the
hand
opinion
on
it.
there
is
one
other
critical
difference
here.
no
one
has
contested
the
fact
and
the
commission
found
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest
that
rea
get
this
money
rapidly.
the
commission
has
been
concerned
about
the
well
being
of
rea
which
is
a
unique
sort
of
an
entity
for
a
great
many
years
and
they've
been
proceeding
after
proceeding
trying
to
keep
this
thing
--
this
organization
functioning
in
different
course.
they
came
to
the
commission
and
persuaded
the
commission
that
they
desperately
needed
the
money.
finding
that
no
one
would
be
injured
by
deferring
the
very
protracted
several
year
type
proceedings
that
are
involved
in
section
5,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission
could
reasonably
find
in
its
expert
judgment
that
they
could
let
the
money
pass
through,
the
initial
$10
million
pass
through,
permit
rea
to
proceed
with
its
program
of
acquiring
the
facilities
which
it
used
to
lease
from
railroads
and
so
on
and
not
make
rea
bear
the
risk,
the
hazards
of
delay
of
these
very
protracted
proceedings
and
god
knows
they
are
very
protracted.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
don't
know
that
we're
in
any
disagreement.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
oh
very
definite.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
do
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
public
interest
standard
in
20a
cannot
mean
the
same
thing
as
the
public
interest
standard
in
section
5
because
of
the
very
different
nature
and
function
of
those
two
sections.
under
section
5,
the
commission
is
authorized
to
immunize,
of
the
antitrust
laws
transactions
it
finds
to
be
in
the
public
interest
under
the
transportation
policy.
it
has
no
such
authority
under
20a.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
our
position
is
that
it
need
not
inevitably
do
so.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
agree,
there
may
be
situations,
i
can
think
of
situations
in
which
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
make
no
sense.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
that
is
right.
well,
public
–-
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
is
right.
i
think
that
nonetheless
it
might
be
required
to
differ
section
20a
resolution
until
it
has
satisfied
itself
under
section
5,
but
that
isn't
the
case
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
that's
correct
and
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
the
example
that
occurs
to
me
is
a
very
clear
case.
if
railroad
a
applies
for
permission
to
all
issue
stock
for
the
purpose
of
exchanging
that
stock
with
the
stock
of
railroad
b,
there's
nothing
there
for
section
20a
to
do
in
terms
of
if
the
railroad
getting
value
for
money,
the
only
question
there,
the
only
economic
reality
there
is
a
transfer
of
control.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
may
be
very
serious
competitive
considerations
and
i
should
think
the
commission
couldn't
proceed
under
20a
until
it
had
satisfied
itself
under
section
5
in
that
situation.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
because
there
is,
because
there
is
nothing
to
the
--
there
is
no
reality
to
the
stock
aspect
of
it,
all
there
is,
is
a
transfer
of
control
but
here
there's
$10
million.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
that's
true
and
i
don't
say
that
are
no
questions
under
20a
there
but
i'm
saying
the
principal
significance
of
the
transactions
from
the
commission's
point
of
view,
it
would
have
to
be.
you
couldn't
ignore,
you
couldn't
differ
reasonably
i
should
think
the
problem
of
control,
but
i
don't
see
why
you
can't
defer
that
question
here
without
prejudicing
any
interest
public
or
private.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
no
because
there
are
serious
competitive
questions
here.
it
seems
to
me
it
really
depends
on
the
facts
of
each
case.
i
--
but
i
think
our
answer
is
this
if
i
can
be
as
simple
as
possible
which
i
haven't
been
here.
section
20
deals
only
with
the
issuance
of
stock.
section
5
deals
with
all
these
of
there
problems
and
all
of
these
problems
should
be
dealt
with
under
5
and
we
shouldn't
attempt
to
the
deal
with
them
under
20,
but
there
is
a
matter
of
judgment
as
to
which
you
should
start
first.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
as
far
as
i
–-
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
-–
understand
–
no,
as
far
as
i
understand
in
the
record
there
has
been
no
application
under
20a
well
for
commission
to
place
greyhound
officers
on
the
board
of
rea.
now
i
suppose
20a
12
is
not
a
very
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
the
by-laws
of
rea
provide
for
them
now
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
20a
(12)
is
not
much
of
an
obstacle
because
you
can
always
find
nominees
who
are
not
greyhound
officers,
but
who
observe
the
purpose
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
true.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
--
that
they
are
as
that
as
a
result
of
the
history
of
expansion
of
the
term
control
and
if
they
are
coextensive
by
reason
of
the
rational
necessity
of
construing
this
regulatory
scheme.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
all
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
white,
is
that
we
can't
conceive
of
a
influence
of
one
corporation
on
another
that
would
tend
substantially
to
lessen
competition
that
would
not
also
involve
an
element
of
control
such
as
to
invoke
the
commission's'
jurisdiction
under
section
5.
control
has
become
after
all
a
term
of
art.
it
does
not
mean
majority
control.
only
two
months
ago
the
court
dealt
with
the
case
of
chicago
and
eastern
where
the
commission
had
found
control
a
violation
of
section
5
through
the
acquisition
of
30%
of
the
stock
of
a
railroad.
it
seems
to
me
that
and
i'll
get
back
to
this
that's
the
two
sections
have
to
be
read
as
of
equal
reach
especially
when
you
take
into
account
the
investment
exception
to
section
7.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
certainly
don't
mean
the
same
thing
and
that
they
have
the
same
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
cover
the
same
ground.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
but
they
deal
with
the
problems
in
somewhat
different
ways.
section
7
is
an
absolute
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
with
the
exception
of
the
fact
that
under
section
7,
no
one
is
authorized
to
consider
whether
the
lessening
of
competition
may
not
be
over
balanced
by
some
advantage
to
public
interest.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
balanced,
bias
whereas
that's
just
what
the
commission
is
required
to
do
under
section
5.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
only
--
the
only
--
well
the
consequence
of
my
adversary's
position
is
that
the
commission
cannot
under
any
circumstances
approve
a
stock
issuance,
an
issuance
of
securities
without
considering
in
advance
any
competitive
anticompetitive
effects
that
might
flow
form
there.
the
ultimate
consequence
of
our
position
is
that
there
maybe
some
cases
and
we
submit
that
this
is
one
where
it's
appropriate
to
deal
with
those
issues
in
sequence.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
want
the
decision
below
affirmed.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
which
authorizes
the
commission
to
postpone
the
section
5?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
it's
a
question
of
timing
in
fact.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
that's
right
they
will
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
would
be
set
aside
until
the
commission
had
considered
the
section
5.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
do
stress
though
that
there
is
every
--
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
as
appellants
have
worried
about
that
they
are
likely
to
be
so
seriously
injured
during
the
period
after
the
tender
offer
is
concluded
before
the
section
5
hearing
to
be
completed.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
first
of
all
any
of
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
at
least
i
don't
think
i
do.
many
of
the
proposed
changes
that
are
sketched
out
in
the
memorandum
of
understanding
that
has
been
referred
to
between
the
two
companies,
many
of
those,
which
as
i
said,
are
still
very
tentative
would
themselves
require
commission
approval.
it
would
also
require
commission
approval
for
officers
of
greyhound
to
place
themselves
on
the
board
of
rea.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
could
do
that
i
suppose,
but
they
would
run
the
very
grave
risk
that
the
commission
would
find
that
they
had
--
the
greyhound
had
achieved
control.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
this
is
imminently
unscramble
[inaudible]
to
me.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
greyhound
can
be
called
upon
to
divest
itself
of
its
stock
and
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
still
stress
that
many
of
the
thoughts
of
consolidation
were
independently
required
commission
approval
in
many
of
other
forms
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
this
is
something
that's
going
to
happen
imminently
and
suddenly
within
those
60
days
before
the
commission
can
begin
to
act
under
section
5.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
isn't
even
so
clear
that
the
money
need
to
go
back
to
greyhound.
the
commission
can
find
that
greyhound
must
divest
itself
of
its
stock
and
can
call
it
a
day.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
those
are
still
prospective
no
one
has
actually
began
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
again
it
seem
to
me
this
is
likely
to
depend
very
heavily
on
what
happens
during
those
60
days
whether
greyhound
will
plan
to
tie
itself
up
intimately
with
a
company,
where
a
majority
of
the
stock
is
owned
by
railroads,
who
are
literally
possible
to
it,
if
southern
pacific
let's
say
exercised
its
right
of
first
refusal,
is
a
dubious
question.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
tender
offer
has
to
be
concluded.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
for
what?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
they
should
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
they
should
--
well
this
is
already
outstanding
stock
so
that
the
stock
that's
to
be
acquired
under
the
tender
offer
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
section
20a
in
any
event.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
but
it
raises
questions
under
5.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
oh!
no,
all
i
can
say
is
that
if
greyhound
walks
away
with
a
million
shares
of
rea
stock
and
happened
either
sterilize
itself
by
putting
that
stock
in
a
voting
trust
or
come
to
the
commission
for
approval
and
put
in
a
voting
trust
pending
approval
it
is
in
very
grave
difficulty
under
the
act
as
the
gilbertville
case,
central
of
georgia
all
indicate
because
violating
section
5
is
grounds
for
disapproving
the
acquisition
of
control.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
mean
that's
somewhat
awkward
decision
in
that
respect
because
the
government
then
--
the
icc
would
not,
in
harmony
the
government
and
the
icc
were
not
in
harmony.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
there
is
a
very
marked
difference
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission's
action
here
serves
the
purpose
of
enlightened
and
informed
decision
making.
it
knew
that
it
maybe
required
to
proceed
under
section
5
and
it
knows
that
it
doesn't
have
the
information
necessary
to
do
the
balancing
either
from
the
advantageous
point
of
view
or
the
anticompetitive
effect
point
of
view,
doesn't
have
the
information
to
do
that.
now
it
can't
do
its
job
as
i
see
it
effectively
under
section
5
at
this
point,
but
it
refrains
from
boxing
itself
in.
it
didn't
prejudge
the
situation.
it
didn't
commit
itself.
it
let
itself
free
to
terminate
this
whole
thing
as
required.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
can
suggest
maybe
two
or
three
points.
here
we
don't
see
any
difficult
in
unscrambling.
here
we
don't
see
that
the
commission
has
put
itself
in
a
position
which
automatically
forces
its
hand
at
a
later
date.
we
think
the
commission
has
preserved
its
freedom
to
act
at
a
later
date.
i
think
there
is
indeed
this
is
--
it's
almost,
our
position
here
is
similar
in
the
sense
that
under
mr.
dempsey's
view
the
commission
was
required
to
proceed
in
a
sort
of
piecemeal
way.
it
was
supposed
to
analyze
an
acquisition
of
20%
under
section
5
perhaps
or
section
7
and
then
two
months
later
sit
down
again
and
say
well
what
about
60%
or
what
about
50%
or
40%
and
it's
that
sort
of
piecemeal
inefficiency
that
it
seems
to
me
the
commission
quite
properly
avoided
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
greyhound
finds
itself
after
60
days
in
a
position
to
effectuate
the
program
of
consolidation
that
it
so
earnestly
desires
then
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
it
must
insulate
rea
from
its
control
until
the
commission
has
come
to
a
conclusion
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
because
if
they
should
proceed
to
exercise
control
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
but
there
are
great
many
cases
that
say
that
to
–
as
this
court
has
said
that
the
commission
is
free
to
require
divestiture
because
control
has
been
acquired
without
authorization
that
what
was
said
in
gilbertville
and
the
commission
has
done
that
in
another
cases.
so
it
would
be
foolhardy
at
least
for
greyhound
to
proceed
that
way
and
the
commission
has
power
to
prevent
it
from
proceeding
that
way.
it
can
go
into
court
if
need
be
to
enjoin
it
from
proceeding
that
way.
it
can
give
all
sorts
of
provisional
relief,
which
we've
outlined
in
our
brief
to
preserve
the
status
quo
pending
its
ultimate
decision.
but
in
the
normal
course
when
a
company
--
when
one
railroad
picks
up
the
stock
of
another
it
does
take
steps
to
immunize
the
controlled
relationship
until
the
commission
has
the
opportunity
to
exercise
its
expert
judgment
on
whether
to
authorize
it
or
not.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
my
impression
is
things
had
gone
rather
beyond
that
there
but
i'm
really
not
an
expert
on
the
penn
central
situation
and
i'd
be
reluctant
to
give
you
a
off
the
hand
opinion
on
it.
there
is
one
other
critical
difference
here.
no
one
has
contested
the
fact
and
the
commission
found
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest
that
rea
get
this
money
rapidly.
the
commission
has
been
concerned
about
the
well
being
of
rea
which
is
a
unique
sort
of
an
entity
for
a
great
many
years
and
they've
been
proceeding
after
proceeding
trying
to
keep
this
thing
--
this
organization
functioning
in
different
course.
they
came
to
the
commission
and
persuaded
the
commission
that
they
desperately
needed
the
money.
finding
that
no
one
would
be
injured
by
deferring
the
very
protracted
several
year
type
proceedings
that
are
involved
in
section
5,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission
could
reasonably
find
in
its
expert
judgment
that
they
could
let
the
money
pass
through,
the
initial
$10
million
pass
through,
permit
rea
to
proceed
with
its
program
of
acquiring
the
facilities
which
it
used
to
lease
from
railroads
and
so
on
and
not
make
rea
bear
the
risk,
the
hazards
of
delay
of
these
very
protracted
proceedings
and
god
knows
they
are
very
protracted.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
don't
know
that
we're
in
any
disagreement.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
oh
very
definite.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
do
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
public
interest
standard
in
20a
cannot
mean
the
same
thing
as
the
public
interest
standard
in
section
5
because
of
the
very
different
nature
and
function
of
those
two
sections.
under
section
5,
the
commission
is
authorized
to
immunize,
of
the
antitrust
laws
transactions
it
finds
to
be
in
the
public
interest
under
the
transportation
policy.
it
has
no
such
authority
under
20a.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
our
position
is
that
it
need
not
inevitably
do
so.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
agree,
there
may
be
situations,
i
can
think
of
situations
in
which
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
make
no
sense.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
that
is
right.
well,
public
–-
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
is
right.
i
think
that
nonetheless
it
might
be
required
to
differ
section
20a
resolution
until
it
has
satisfied
itself
under
section
5,
but
that
isn't
the
case
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
that's
correct
and
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
the
example
that
occurs
to
me
is
a
very
clear
case.
if
railroad
a
applies
for
permission
to
all
issue
stock
for
the
purpose
of
exchanging
that
stock
with
the
stock
of
railroad
b,
there's
nothing
there
for
section
20a
to
do
in
terms
of
if
the
railroad
getting
value
for
money,
the
only
question
there,
the
only
economic
reality
there
is
a
transfer
of
control.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
may
be
very
serious
competitive
considerations
and
i
should
think
the
commission
couldn't
proceed
under
20a
until
it
had
satisfied
itself
under
section
5
in
that
situation.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
because
there
is,
because
there
is
nothing
to
the
--
there
is
no
reality
to
the
stock
aspect
of
it,
all
there
is,
is
a
transfer
of
control
but
here
there's
$10
million.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
that's
true
and
i
don't
say
that
are
no
questions
under
20a
there
but
i'm
saying
the
principal
significance
of
the
transactions
from
the
commission's
point
of
view,
it
would
have
to
be.
you
couldn't
ignore,
you
couldn't
differ
reasonably
i
should
think
the
problem
of
control,
but
i
don't
see
why
you
can't
defer
that
question
here
without
prejudicing
any
interest
public
or
private.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
no
because
there
are
serious
competitive
questions
here.
it
seems
to
me
it
really
depends
on
the
facts
of
each
case.
i
--
but
i
think
our
answer
is
this
if
i
can
be
as
simple
as
possible
which
i
haven't
been
here.
section
20
deals
only
with
the
issuance
of
stock.
section
5
deals
with
all
these
of
there
problems
and
all
of
these
problems
should
be
dealt
with
under
5
and
we
shouldn't
attempt
to
the
deal
with
them
under
20,
but
there
is
a
matter
of
judgment
as
to
which
you
should
start
first.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
as
far
as
i
–-
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
-–
understand
–
no,
as
far
as
i
understand
in
the
record
there
has
been
no
application
under
20a
well
for
commission
to
place
greyhound
officers
on
the
board
of
rea.
now
i
suppose
20a
12
is
not
a
very
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
the
by-laws
of
rea
provide
for
them
now
and
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
20a
(12)
is
not
much
of
an
obstacle
because
you
can
always
find
nominees
who
are
not
greyhound
officers,
but
who
observe
the
purpose
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
true.
thank
you.
