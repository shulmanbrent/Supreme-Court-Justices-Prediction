mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
usher
of
the
case
here
presents
two
problems.
one,
did
the
petitioner
raise
the
federal
question
that
he
is
urging
before
your
honors
now
at
--
in
the
appropriate
time?
secondly,
if
he
did
not,
is
there
any
merit
to
the
points
that
he
does
raise?
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
are
urging
that
in
our
brief
that
he
did
not
raise
the
federal
questions
in
the
appropriate
time.
i
should
point
out
that
in
the
opposition
for
petition
for
certiorari
where
we
should
have
raised
this
point,
our
point
was
not
raised.
we
were
not
counsel
at
that
stage.
when
we
came
in
we
thought
that
this
was
a
jurisdictional
problem
and
we
do
raise
it
at
this
late
stage
of
the
game.
we
do
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
this
time
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
we
apologize
for
not
raising
it
to
you
at
the
time
when
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
before
you.
the
facts
are
very
simple.
at
the
trial
the
case
was
tried
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
the
case
of
ordinary
negligence.
when
judgment
was
entered
for
the
plaintiff
and
it
was
convened
for
the
court,
i'll
refer
to
the
parties,
this
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
because
they
then
interchange
our
position
when
they'd
come
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
but
when
judgment
was
--
for
the
plaintiff
the
defendant
appealed
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
in
the
michigan
supreme
court
for
the
first
time
it
called
attention
to
act
201.
act
201
on
the
face
of
it
deprives
the
court
below
of
jurisdiction
that
provides
that
there's
no
cause
of
action
shall
arise
when
people
are
upon
the
lands
of
another
for
the
purpose
of
hunting,
fishing
or
trapping
unless
there's
either
compensation
paid
or
unless
the
occupier
of
the
land
is
guilty
of
gross
negligence
or
wanton
and
willful
misconduct.
in
the
brief
before
the
michigan
supreme
court
the
question
was
specifically
raised
and
we
have
incorporated
as
an
appendix
a
to
our
brief
in
this
court
the
portion
of
our
brief
raising
this
point
in
the
portion
of
the
plaintiff's
brief
and
required
thereto.
we
specifically
raised
the
question,
whether
the
court
of
appeal
--
whether
the
supreme
court
could
consider
act
201
as
dispositive
even
though
it
had
not
been
raised
in
the
court
below?
we
raises
the
question,
we
brief
to
point
--
we
specifically
pointed
out
that
under
the
cases
that
we
cited
that
while
normally
it
look
--
the
--
an
appellate
court
would
not
consider
a
point
for
the
first
time
when
raised
there
when
it
had
not
been
raised
below.
that
it
was
a
matter
--
that
the
court
could
consider
and
that
if
it
were
a
case
like
the
instant
one
where
there
was
a
statute
which
removed
the
cause
of
action
as
one
that
court
should
consider.
more
or
less
we
point
that
moreover
we
pointed
out
that
as
we
interpreted
the
statute
it
was
not
a
matter
of
defense
for
the
defendant
to
raise
but
was
a
matter
of
the
cause
of
action
of
the
plaintiff
and
therefore
it
was
something
that
the
plaintiff
should
have
addressed
himself
to.
the
defendant
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
plaintiff
then
filed
its
reply
brief.
we
filed
the
first
brief.
in
his
reply
brief
he
addressed
himself
specifically
to
the
points
that
we
had
raised.
we
had
set
forth
a
number
of
state
authorities
to
the
point
that
the
state
as
a
matter
of
state
law
can't
--
the
state
supreme
court
can't
as
a
matter
of
state
law
consider
the
matter.
plaintiff
disagreed.
he
cited
a
number
of
state
cases
to
the
fact
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
could
not
or
should
not
consider
the
matter.
he
disputed
our
contention
that
the
statute
was
a
matter
of
--
for
the
plaintiff's
responsibility,
he
said
it
was
a
matter
for
the
defendants
responsibility
to
plea.
the
matter
was
at
issue.
neither
one
of
us
should
raise
any
federal
question
up
to
that
point
which
--
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
michigan
can't
consider
it.
he
said
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
michigan
cannot
consider
it.
the
michigan
supreme
court
then
proceeded
by
five
to
three
vote
to
rule
that
the
statute
could
be
considered
that
it
was
a
matter
that
was
a
responsibility
of
the
plaintiff
and
that
on
that
basis
the
plaintiff
had
not
made
out
a
cause
of
action
and
that
the
matter
should
be
reversed
without
a
new
trial.
i
should
point
out
that
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
pardon
me?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
developed
by
the
plaintiff,
i
don't
think
so
because
all
of
the
evidence
that
we
refer
to
our
brief
is
evidence
that
he
brought
out
on
direct
examination.
facts
of
facts,
you
don't
--
it
wasn't
a
question
that
we
have
surprised
them
by
bringing
up
something
that
affected
this
--
there
is
de
facto
were
on
opposition.
all
of
the
facts
were
brought
out.
he
alleges
in
his
complaint
that
the
children
were
out
trapping.
in
his
opening
statement
to
the
court
he
said
the
children
were
out
trapping.
in
his
opening
statement
to
the
jury
he
made
the
same
thing.
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
you'll
look
at
page
20
--
30
of
our
brief
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
page
30
of
our
brief,
the
blue
colored
brief.
it's
significant
that
even
after
we
had
raised
this
point
of
our
act
201
and
its
applicability.
and
defendant
--
the
plaintiff
then
filed
his
reply
brief.
you
will
notice
we
quote
there
from,
he
himself
in
stating
the
facts
says,
“on
december
21,
1958,
james
heider,
age
12
and
david
heider,
age
8
1/2
and
their
cocker
spaniel
drowned
while
trapping
for
muskrats
and
minks
on
the
defendants
property.
everything
that
was
before
the
court,
the
facts
as
he
had
developed,
the
admissions
he
had
made,
the
statements
he
made.
the
statement
he
had
made
to
the
supreme
court
even
after
he
saw
our
contention
was
that
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
we
have
collected
in
our
brief
at
pages
28
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes,
and
29,
a
summary
of
the
evidence
as
developed
by
the
plaintiff
which
pretty
clearly
indicated
that
they
were
out
for
the
purpose
of
trapping.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
declaration
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no.
the
declaration
specifically
stated
--
in
the
plaintiff's
own
declaration
that
there
was
a
lack
of
ordinary
care
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
and
under
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
under
--
other
michigan
supreme
court
cases
when
the
plaintiff
states
his
declaration
in
such
a
manner
he
is
not
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
whether
in
addition
there
were
gross
negligence.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
interpreting
this
statute
said
that
the
burden
was
on
the
plaintiff,
at
least
five
judges
said
so.
i'
m
not
sure
the
three
other
judges
disagreed.
i
think
the
other
three
judges
thought
that
the
statute
was
not
applicable
and
therefore
never
reached
this
point.
but
five
judges
specifically
indicated
that
was
his
burden
that
he
failed
to
do
it
on
the
question
as
to
whether
he
could
or
could
not
amend,
he
has
never
asked
the
--
even
the
michigan
supreme
court
believe
to
amend
either
in
his
original
argument
or
in
his
application
for
rehearing.
he'd
never
ask
and
now
what
if
they
would
have
granted
leave
to
amend
the
note,
i
don't
know.
the
supreme
court
does
have
authorities
to
permit
him
to
do
it
but
even
to
this
day
that
request
was
never
made
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
when
the
michigan
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
he
--
him
--
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
he
could
either
asked
them
for
--
to
give
permission
to
amend
in
the
court
below
or
to
reverse
when
the
instructions
permit
him
to
amend.
the
question
was
never
raised.
the
question
was
never
raised
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
he
did
what?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
only
on
the
application
--
the
petition
for
rehearing,
he'd
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
after
they
have
ruled
on
this
point,
but
even
then
he
didn't
ask
for
leave
to
amend
or
even
then
he
didn't
even
ask
for
a
new
trial.
he
then
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
or
to
remand
to
the
court
below
with
permission
to
leave
to
amend.
the
fact
remains
is
that
the
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
he
asked
for
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
he
never
counted
--
he
never
count
--
we
asked
for
the
court
to
reverse
either
with
or
without
a
new
trial
and
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
reversed
without
a
new
trial
because
under
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
another
--
the
part
attached
thereto,
the
part
that's
reprinted
in
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
ask
for
anything.
what
he
contended,
he
attached
affidavits
which
show
that
he
--
that
the
younger
of
the
two
heider
boys
was
not
in
fact
capable
of
trapping
and
that
he
wanted
the
opportunity
to
show
that.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes,
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
at
the
application
for
rehearing
in
the
state
just
to
one
of
the
boys
is
not
to
the
other.
the
michigan
supreme
court
refused
to
--
disposed
of
that
without
opinion
on
the
five-to-two
vote
and
the
matter
then
came
here.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
now,
here
he
raises
both
substantive
due
process
and
procedural
due
process.
substantive
due
process
he
says
that
act
201
is
unconstitutional.
that
point
was
never
raised
before
the
michigan
supreme
court
until
the
application
for
rehearing.
he
was
clearly
on
notice
when
we
filed
our
original
brief
that
we
are
going
to
rely
on
act
201.
we
specifically
called
the
courts
attention
to
it
and
at
that
point
when
he
argued
to
the
court
he
never
gave
him
any
indications
that
act
201
was
substantively
unconstitutional.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
his
equal
protection
argument,
yes.
on
that
he
waived
--
clearly
he
was
on
notice
and
if
he
had
a
substantive
constitutional
point
he
should've
raised
at
that
point.
he
raised
it
for
the
first
time
on
petition
for
a
rehearing
and
we
contend
that
that's
too
late.
he
also
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
raised
for
the
first
time
the
question
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
that
somehow
rather
acted
unconstitutionally
by
relying
on
act
201
when
it
had
not
been
raised
in
the
trial
court.
all
contentions
on
that
point
up
to
that
stage
of
the
proceeding
had
been
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
there's
been
no
federal
constitutional
law
point
raised
at
all.
both
parties
had
addressed
themselves
to
that
contention
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
michigan
supreme
court
disposed
of
it
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
then
the
matter
was
--
first
raised
on
an
application
for
rehearing
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
which
disposed
of
it
without
writing
an
opinion.
under
the
case
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
which
says,
it
is
too
late
to
raise
a
constitutional
law,
a
federal
constitutional
law
point
at
the
stage
of
petition
for
rehearing.
now,
we
recognize
in
the
cases
we
cite
that
there
are
two
exceptions
to
that
principle.
one
is
where
the
federal
constitutional
point
is
raised
for
the
first
time
on
petition
for
a
rehearing
and
the
state
court
does
in
fact
in
disposing
that
petition
for
rehearing
consider
the
federal
constitutional
points.
that
did
not
happen
here.
the
cases
are
very
clear
that
where
the
state
supreme
court
refuses
to
write
an
opinion
but
just
disposes
a
petition
for
rehearing
without
an
opinion
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
raises
at
that
stage
is
too
late.
there's
a
second
line
of
a
case
that
we
are
--
where
it
create
an
exception,
there
are
the
case
of
saunders
v.
shaw
and
the
brinkerhoff
case
that
we
cite.
these
are
the
cases
where
there
are
supervening
circumstances
that
petition
that
could
not
have
reasonably
anticipated
which
result
in
petition
or
not
raising
the
constitutional
point
until
the
petition
for
rehearing
stage.
and
the
brinkerhoff
case
illustrates
that
point
very
well.
it's
almost
a
case
of
entrapment
or
almost
of
sandbagging
to
use
a
colloquial
expression.
in
that
case,
an
attack
had
been
made
on
the
constitutionality
of
attacks.
the
--
when
the
taxpayer
lost,
he
took
the
matter
of
supreme
court.
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
said
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
because
he
had
not
applied
to
an
administrative
tribunal
for
the
purpose
of
asking
relief
on
this
very
point.
now,
it
so
happen
that
prior
to
the
brinkerhoff
in
the
lower
court,
the
decisions
of
that
same
supreme
court
have
held
that
the
administrative
remedies
were
not
in
fact
available
to
a
taxpayer.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
in
brinkerhoff
overruled
its
earlier
opinion
and
said,
"we
were
wrong."
the
administrative
proceeding
is
in
fact
available
to
a
taxpayer
and
you
are
out
of
court
because
you
didn't
resort
to
that
administrative
remedy.
well,
clearly
this
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
there,
a
taxpayer
didn't
follow
an
administrative
proceeding
that
was
not
available
to
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
brinkerhoff,
the
court
itself
--
this
court
made
clear
that
had
there
not
been
a
prior
opinion
of
the
state
courts
specifically
holding
that
the
administrative
remedy
was
not
available,
in
other
words
had
the
question
been
undecided
up
to
that
point,
then
the
taxpayer
would
run
the
risk
of
making
up
his
mind
of
interpreting
the
state
law
as
to
whether
the
administrative
remedy
was
or
was
not
in
fact
available
to
him.
and
if
he
guessed
wrong
on
that,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
could
throw
him
out
for
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedy.
what
the
--
what
this
court
said
in
brinkerhoff
was
that
would
the
--
that
where
the
lower
supreme
court,
whether
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
have
previously
--
explicitly
held
that
the
remedy
was
not
available
it
could
not
and
the
very
opinion
reversing
that
earlier
opinion
come
back
and
say,
"but
we
were
wrong
before.
we
reversed
it.
the
administrative
remedy
is
in
fact
available
and
we're
throwing
you
out
for
not
addressing
yourself
to
it."
it
therefore
appears
to
be
very
clear
to
us
that
neither
at
the
exception
is
available
and
that
this
constitutional
problem
are
therefore
not
properly
before
the
court.
on
the
merits
and
the
argument
on
the
merits
really
blend
very
much
with
the
procedural
arguments
except
on
sections
with
due
process.
assuming
that
he
is
entitled
to
raise
for
the
first
time
the
substantive
due
process
question
here,
it
is
our
contention
that
there's
no
merit
whatsoever.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
a
very
reasonable
classification
for
the
state
to
him
--
to
engage
in.
the
state
can
say
that
people
who
are
on
the
lands
of
the
other
for
the
purpose
of
hunting,
fishing
and
trapping
are
a
different
class
of
people
and
that
therefore
the
law
can
be
different
with
respect
to
them
than
it
is
to
people
who
are
there
for
purposes,
say,
of
swimming.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
a
collection
of
statutes
in
some
30
states
which
have
attempted
to
address
themselves
to
this
very
problem.
there's
no
legislative
history
in
michigan
which
explains
what
the
michigan
supreme
court
have
in
mind.
there
are
in
other
cases
where
the
same
statute
has
been
enacted,
legislative
declarations
to
the
effect
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
such
a
statute
is
to
encourage
landowners
to
permit
their
private
lands
to
be
utilized
for
hunting,
fishing
and
trapping.
we
cite
a
law
review
article
in
--
it
was
contrary
being
to
the
effect
that
apparently
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
it
may
very
well
be
and
maybe
if
we
were
legislators,
we
would
not
do
it
this
way.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
seven
legislators
have
specifically
said
they
did
it
for
that
purpose
in
enacting
a
statute
similar
to
the
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
there
is
no
legislative
history
in
michigan
itself
on
that
point.
but
we
think
where
30
states
have
adopted
a
legislation
of
this
type
and
where
seven
of
those
legislators
have
indicated
that
this
is
the
purpose.
we
think
that
this
is
a
valid
legislative
purpose
and
is
not
such
invidious
discrimination
that
you
ought
to
strike
it
down.
just
as
a
matter
of
digression,
it's
interesting
to
know
that
the
plaintiff
says
that
this
is
a
change
to
the
common
law
of
michigan.
as
a
matter
of
fact
michigan
until
1957
was
one
of
the
stricter
of
the
common
law
states
which
held
that
the
rule
of
trespasses
was
applicable
even
to
minors
as
well
as
to
adults.
it
since
has
changed
probably
not
as
completely
some
of
the
other
states
but
it
has
changed
somewhat.
but
it's
interesting
that
in
1953
when
this
statute
was
enacted
the
common
law
was
still
in
effect
even
for
minors,
that
even
minors
under
the
michigan
common
law
were
not
entitled
to
protection
when
trespassing
on
the
land
of
another
unless
except
for
--
as
against
gross
negligence.
so
there
weren't
even
change
in
the
common
law.
but
in
any
event
under
the
cases
that
this
court
we
have
cited,
this
court
has
held
that
the
state
--
that
the
states
in
the
railroad
cases
can
enact
statutes
that
when
even
they're
applicable
to
children
of
five
or
seven
preclude
them
from
recovering
for
--
being
injured
when
on
the
land
of
a
railroad.
and
those
statutes
have
been
upheld
by
this
court.
on
a
procedural
point
again
we
don't
--
we
think
normally,
it
wasn't
timely
raised
but
that
there
is
no
real
point
involved.
two,
it
would've
been
better
procedure
had
we
--
had
the
statute
been
called
to
the
trial
court's
attention.
i
don't
say
that
the
fault
was
any
more
ours
than
that
of
the
plaintiff.
as
lawyers
i
think
both
sets
of
lawyers
owed
it
to
the
court
to
know
about
the
statute.
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
to
know
about
the
existence
of
the
statute.
it
had
been
--
the
statute
had
been
enacted
before
the
accidents
occurred
and
before
this
cause
of
action
was
filed.
it
was
the
responsibility
of
both
sets
of
lawyers
to
know
it.
the
fact
remains
that
it
--
at
an
appropriate
stage
of
the
proceeding
it
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
michigan
supreme
court.
the
points
were
adequately
briefed
there
by
both
sides.
the
very
contentions
that
petitioner
ultimately
raised
were
urged
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
they
we
re
fully
considered
by
the
michigan
supreme
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes,
in
his
--
for
the
respondent,
you
mean,
for
michigan
sugar?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
in
his
opening
brief
to
the
michigan
supreme
court,
he
called
the
attention
to
it
and
specifically
have
a
statement
in
it
to
the
effect
that
he
apologized
to
the
court
for
the
fact
that
he
had
just
discovered
the
existence
of
the
statute
in
preparing
his
brief
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
right,
yes,
and
entered
it
so
that
there's
--
the
explicit
statement
of
counsel
to
the
effect
that
he
found
it
there
for
the
first
time.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
that
had
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case
called
the
attention
of
the
court
to
act
201
and
move
for
a
directed
verdict
on
the
basis
of
act
201
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i
think
had
they
known
about
at
that
stage
the
court
would've
dismissed
the
complaint
and
then
there
would've
been
a
question
whether
they
could
in
fact
plead
a
good
cause
of
action
on
the
facts
that
they
have
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
--
under
the
statute.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
when
the
complaint
is
not
--
and
unless
they
amended
the
complaint
under
michigan
practice,
under
the
case
we
have
cited,
you
do
not
instruct
the
jury
on
gross
negligence
when
the
complaint
itself
simply
refer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
pardon?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
it
--
with
--
they've
--
whether
they
would've
attempted
to
amend
or
not,
i
don't
know.
it's
significant
that
two
of
the
five
judges
who
reversed
that
that
as
a
matter
of
law
there
wasn't
even
enough
evidence
to
show
ordinary
negligence.
so
whether
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
pardon?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
i
think
it's
extremely
likely
that
they
would
have
amended,
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
but
under
a
statute
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
they
have
been
--
if
they
have
been
so
deprived,
they've
been
deprived
by
their
own
conduct
in
overlooking
the
statute.
now,
maybe
a
state
supreme
court
in
a
different
state
would
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
i
don't
know
why
michigan
--
why
two
sets
of
michigan
lawyers
overlooked
the
statute
that
had
been
on
the
book
for
several
years.
i
mean
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
no.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
we
have
not
become
counsel
on
this
case
until
the
petitions
--
until
the
brief
on
the
merits
were
filed.
so
whether
we
would've
done
better,
that's
easy
for
us
to
say
we
would've
but
we
were
not
counsel
in
the
case
and
clearly
both
sets
of
counsel
should've
known
about
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
statute
which
is
the
responsibility
which
the
michigan
supreme
court
has
held
is
irresponsible,
the
plaintiff
to
plea.
when
they
didn't,
the
michigan
supreme
court
said,
"you
haven't
--
not
done
so,
you're
out
of
the
court."
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
they
plead
--
they
pleaded
facts
that
had
they
known
the
statute
--
they
pleaded
facts
that
on
the
way
they
pleaded
and
the
facts
as
they
developed
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
win.
nobody's
--
nobody
entrapped
them
on
the
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
pardon?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
the
michigan
supreme
court
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
all
i
can
say
is
and
i'm
not
a
practitioner
in
michigan
but
from
reading
their
cases
they
are
a
strict
court
even
though
finding
ordinary
negligence.
they
find
as
a
matter
of
law
that
whether
in
other
cases
would
be
a
clear
case
of
ordinary
negligence
to
--
at
least
one
the
title
go
to
the
jury.
they
direct
verdict
for
the
defendant.
michigan
i
think
is
a
strong
defendant
state
in
this
area
of
law
rather
than
the
plaintiff's
state.
and
two
of
the
judges
thought
that
as
a
matter
of
law
there
was
no
ordinary
negligence.
when
you
read
some
of
the
other
cases,
the
court
directs
verdict
on
ordinary
negligence
in
this
type
of
situation.
now,
it's
just
pure
--
it's
a
pure
conjuncture
how
they
will
come
out
but
this
is
a
defendant's
minded
court
on
negligence
matter.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
usher
of
the
case
here
presents
two
problems.
one,
did
the
petitioner
raise
the
federal
question
that
he
is
urging
before
your
honors
now
at
--
in
the
appropriate
time?
secondly,
if
he
did
not,
is
there
any
merit
to
the
points
that
he
does
raise?
i
should
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
are
urging
that
in
our
brief
that
he
did
not
raise
the
federal
questions
in
the
appropriate
time.
i
should
point
out
that
in
the
opposition
for
petition
for
certiorari
where
we
should
have
raised
this
point,
our
point
was
not
raised.
we
were
not
counsel
at
that
stage.
when
we
came
in
we
thought
that
this
was
a
jurisdictional
problem
and
we
do
raise
it
at
this
late
stage
of
the
game.
we
do
think
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
this
time
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
we
apologize
for
not
raising
it
to
you
at
the
time
when
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
before
you.
the
facts
are
very
simple.
at
the
trial
the
case
was
tried
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
the
case
of
ordinary
negligence.
when
judgment
was
entered
for
the
plaintiff
and
it
was
convened
for
the
court,
i'll
refer
to
the
parties,
this
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
because
they
then
interchange
our
position
when
they'd
come
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
but
when
judgment
was
--
for
the
plaintiff
the
defendant
appealed
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
in
the
michigan
supreme
court
for
the
first
time
it
called
attention
to
act
201.
act
201
on
the
face
of
it
deprives
the
court
below
of
jurisdiction
that
provides
that
there's
no
cause
of
action
shall
arise
when
people
are
upon
the
lands
of
another
for
the
purpose
of
hunting,
fishing
or
trapping
unless
there's
either
compensation
paid
or
unless
the
occupier
of
the
land
is
guilty
of
gross
negligence
or
wanton
and
willful
misconduct.
in
the
brief
before
the
michigan
supreme
court
the
question
was
specifically
raised
and
we
have
incorporated
as
an
appendix
a
to
our
brief
in
this
court
the
portion
of
our
brief
raising
this
point
in
the
portion
of
the
plaintiff's
brief
and
required
thereto.
we
specifically
raised
the
question,
whether
the
court
of
appeal
--
whether
the
supreme
court
could
consider
act
201
as
dispositive
even
though
it
had
not
been
raised
in
the
court
below?
we
raises
the
question,
we
brief
to
point
--
we
specifically
pointed
out
that
under
the
cases
that
we
cited
that
while
normally
it
look
--
the
--
an
appellate
court
would
not
consider
a
point
for
the
first
time
when
raised
there
when
it
had
not
been
raised
below.
that
it
was
a
matter
--
that
the
court
could
consider
and
that
if
it
were
a
case
like
the
instant
one
where
there
was
a
statute
which
removed
the
cause
of
action
as
one
that
court
should
consider.
more
or
less
we
point
that
moreover
we
pointed
out
that
as
we
interpreted
the
statute
it
was
not
a
matter
of
defense
for
the
defendant
to
raise
but
was
a
matter
of
the
cause
of
action
of
the
plaintiff
and
therefore
it
was
something
that
the
plaintiff
should
have
addressed
himself
to.
the
defendant
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
plaintiff
then
filed
its
reply
brief.
we
filed
the
first
brief.
in
his
reply
brief
he
addressed
himself
specifically
to
the
points
that
we
had
raised.
we
had
set
forth
a
number
of
state
authorities
to
the
point
that
the
state
as
a
matter
of
state
law
can't
--
the
state
supreme
court
can't
as
a
matter
of
state
law
consider
the
matter.
plaintiff
disagreed.
he
cited
a
number
of
state
cases
to
the
fact
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
could
not
or
should
not
consider
the
matter.
he
disputed
our
contention
that
the
statute
was
a
matter
of
--
for
the
plaintiff's
responsibility,
he
said
it
was
a
matter
for
the
defendants
responsibility
to
plea.
the
matter
was
at
issue.
neither
one
of
us
should
raise
any
federal
question
up
to
that
point
which
--
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
michigan
can't
consider
it.
he
said
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
michigan
cannot
consider
it.
the
michigan
supreme
court
then
proceeded
by
five
to
three
vote
to
rule
that
the
statute
could
be
considered
that
it
was
a
matter
that
was
a
responsibility
of
the
plaintiff
and
that
on
that
basis
the
plaintiff
had
not
made
out
a
cause
of
action
and
that
the
matter
should
be
reversed
without
a
new
trial.
i
should
point
out
that
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
pardon
me?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
developed
by
the
plaintiff,
i
don't
think
so
because
all
of
the
evidence
that
we
refer
to
our
brief
is
evidence
that
he
brought
out
on
direct
examination.
facts
of
facts,
you
don't
--
it
wasn't
a
question
that
we
have
surprised
them
by
bringing
up
something
that
affected
this
--
there
is
de
facto
were
on
opposition.
all
of
the
facts
were
brought
out.
he
alleges
in
his
complaint
that
the
children
were
out
trapping.
in
his
opening
statement
to
the
court
he
said
the
children
were
out
trapping.
in
his
opening
statement
to
the
jury
he
made
the
same
thing.
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
you'll
look
at
page
20
--
30
of
our
brief
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
page
30
of
our
brief,
the
blue
colored
brief.
it's
significant
that
even
after
we
had
raised
this
point
of
our
act
201
and
its
applicability.
and
defendant
--
the
plaintiff
then
filed
his
reply
brief.
you
will
notice
we
quote
there
from,
he
himself
in
stating
the
facts
says,
“on
december
21,
1958,
james
heider,
age
12
and
david
heider,
age
8
1/2
and
their
cocker
spaniel
drowned
while
trapping
for
muskrats
and
minks
on
the
defendants
property.
everything
that
was
before
the
court,
the
facts
as
he
had
developed,
the
admissions
he
had
made,
the
statements
he
made.
the
statement
he
had
made
to
the
supreme
court
even
after
he
saw
our
contention
was
that
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
we
have
collected
in
our
brief
at
pages
28
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes,
and
29,
a
summary
of
the
evidence
as
developed
by
the
plaintiff
which
pretty
clearly
indicated
that
they
were
out
for
the
purpose
of
trapping.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
declaration
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no.
the
declaration
specifically
stated
--
in
the
plaintiff's
own
declaration
that
there
was
a
lack
of
ordinary
care
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
and
under
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
under
--
other
michigan
supreme
court
cases
when
the
plaintiff
states
his
declaration
in
such
a
manner
he
is
not
entitled
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
whether
in
addition
there
were
gross
negligence.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
interpreting
this
statute
said
that
the
burden
was
on
the
plaintiff,
at
least
five
judges
said
so.
i'
m
not
sure
the
three
other
judges
disagreed.
i
think
the
other
three
judges
thought
that
the
statute
was
not
applicable
and
therefore
never
reached
this
point.
but
five
judges
specifically
indicated
that
was
his
burden
that
he
failed
to
do
it
on
the
question
as
to
whether
he
could
or
could
not
amend,
he
has
never
asked
the
--
even
the
michigan
supreme
court
believe
to
amend
either
in
his
original
argument
or
in
his
application
for
rehearing.
he'd
never
ask
and
now
what
if
they
would
have
granted
leave
to
amend
the
note,
i
don't
know.
the
supreme
court
does
have
authorities
to
permit
him
to
do
it
but
even
to
this
day
that
request
was
never
made
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
when
the
michigan
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
he
--
him
--
yes.
i
think
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
he
could
either
asked
them
for
--
to
give
permission
to
amend
in
the
court
below
or
to
reverse
when
the
instructions
permit
him
to
amend.
the
question
was
never
raised.
the
question
was
never
raised
by
the
plaintiff.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
he
did
what?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
only
on
the
application
--
the
petition
for
rehearing,
he'd
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
after
they
have
ruled
on
this
point,
but
even
then
he
didn't
ask
for
leave
to
amend
or
even
then
he
didn't
even
ask
for
a
new
trial.
he
then
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
or
to
remand
to
the
court
below
with
permission
to
leave
to
amend.
the
fact
remains
is
that
the
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
he
asked
for
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
he
never
counted
--
he
never
count
--
we
asked
for
the
court
to
reverse
either
with
or
without
a
new
trial
and
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
reversed
without
a
new
trial
because
under
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
another
--
the
part
attached
thereto,
the
part
that's
reprinted
in
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
ask
for
anything.
what
he
contended,
he
attached
affidavits
which
show
that
he
--
that
the
younger
of
the
two
heider
boys
was
not
in
fact
capable
of
trapping
and
that
he
wanted
the
opportunity
to
show
that.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes,
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
at
the
application
for
rehearing
in
the
state
just
to
one
of
the
boys
is
not
to
the
other.
the
michigan
supreme
court
refused
to
--
disposed
of
that
without
opinion
on
the
five-to-two
vote
and
the
matter
then
came
here.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
now,
here
he
raises
both
substantive
due
process
and
procedural
due
process.
substantive
due
process
he
says
that
act
201
is
unconstitutional.
that
point
was
never
raised
before
the
michigan
supreme
court
until
the
application
for
rehearing.
he
was
clearly
on
notice
when
we
filed
our
original
brief
that
we
are
going
to
rely
on
act
201.
we
specifically
called
the
courts
attention
to
it
and
at
that
point
when
he
argued
to
the
court
he
never
gave
him
any
indications
that
act
201
was
substantively
unconstitutional.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
his
equal
protection
argument,
yes.
on
that
he
waived
--
clearly
he
was
on
notice
and
if
he
had
a
substantive
constitutional
point
he
should've
raised
at
that
point.
he
raised
it
for
the
first
time
on
petition
for
a
rehearing
and
we
contend
that
that's
too
late.
he
also
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
raised
for
the
first
time
the
question
that
the
michigan
supreme
court
that
somehow
rather
acted
unconstitutionally
by
relying
on
act
201
when
it
had
not
been
raised
in
the
trial
court.
all
contentions
on
that
point
up
to
that
stage
of
the
proceeding
had
been
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
there's
been
no
federal
constitutional
law
point
raised
at
all.
both
parties
had
addressed
themselves
to
that
contention
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
michigan
supreme
court
disposed
of
it
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
then
the
matter
was
--
first
raised
on
an
application
for
rehearing
to
the
michigan
supreme
court
which
disposed
of
it
without
writing
an
opinion.
under
the
case
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
which
says,
it
is
too
late
to
raise
a
constitutional
law,
a
federal
constitutional
law
point
at
the
stage
of
petition
for
rehearing.
now,
we
recognize
in
the
cases
we
cite
that
there
are
two
exceptions
to
that
principle.
one
is
where
the
federal
constitutional
point
is
raised
for
the
first
time
on
petition
for
a
rehearing
and
the
state
court
does
in
fact
in
disposing
that
petition
for
rehearing
consider
the
federal
constitutional
points.
that
did
not
happen
here.
the
cases
are
very
clear
that
where
the
state
supreme
court
refuses
to
write
an
opinion
but
just
disposes
a
petition
for
rehearing
without
an
opinion
that
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
raises
at
that
stage
is
too
late.
there's
a
second
line
of
a
case
that
we
are
--
where
it
create
an
exception,
there
are
the
case
of
saunders
v.
shaw
and
the
brinkerhoff
case
that
we
cite.
these
are
the
cases
where
there
are
supervening
circumstances
that
petition
that
could
not
have
reasonably
anticipated
which
result
in
petition
or
not
raising
the
constitutional
point
until
the
petition
for
rehearing
stage.
and
the
brinkerhoff
case
illustrates
that
point
very
well.
it's
almost
a
case
of
entrapment
or
almost
of
sandbagging
to
use
a
colloquial
expression.
in
that
case,
an
attack
had
been
made
on
the
constitutionality
of
attacks.
the
--
when
the
taxpayer
lost,
he
took
the
matter
of
supreme
court.
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
said
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
because
he
had
not
applied
to
an
administrative
tribunal
for
the
purpose
of
asking
relief
on
this
very
point.
now,
it
so
happen
that
prior
to
the
brinkerhoff
in
the
lower
court,
the
decisions
of
that
same
supreme
court
have
held
that
the
administrative
remedies
were
not
in
fact
available
to
a
taxpayer.
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
in
brinkerhoff
overruled
its
earlier
opinion
and
said,
"we
were
wrong."
the
administrative
proceeding
is
in
fact
available
to
a
taxpayer
and
you
are
out
of
court
because
you
didn't
resort
to
that
administrative
remedy.
well,
clearly
this
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
there,
a
taxpayer
didn't
follow
an
administrative
proceeding
that
was
not
available
to
him.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
brinkerhoff,
the
court
itself
--
this
court
made
clear
that
had
there
not
been
a
prior
opinion
of
the
state
courts
specifically
holding
that
the
administrative
remedy
was
not
available,
in
other
words
had
the
question
been
undecided
up
to
that
point,
then
the
taxpayer
would
run
the
risk
of
making
up
his
mind
of
interpreting
the
state
law
as
to
whether
the
administrative
remedy
was
or
was
not
in
fact
available
to
him.
and
if
he
guessed
wrong
on
that,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
could
throw
him
out
for
failure
to
exhaust
administrative
remedy.
what
the
--
what
this
court
said
in
brinkerhoff
was
that
would
the
--
that
where
the
lower
supreme
court,
whether
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
have
previously
--
explicitly
held
that
the
remedy
was
not
available
it
could
not
and
the
very
opinion
reversing
that
earlier
opinion
come
back
and
say,
"but
we
were
wrong
before.
we
reversed
it.
the
administrative
remedy
is
in
fact
available
and
we're
throwing
you
out
for
not
addressing
yourself
to
it."
it
therefore
appears
to
be
very
clear
to
us
that
neither
at
the
exception
is
available
and
that
this
constitutional
problem
are
therefore
not
properly
before
the
court.
on
the
merits
and
the
argument
on
the
merits
really
blend
very
much
with
the
procedural
arguments
except
on
sections
with
due
process.
assuming
that
he
is
entitled
to
raise
for
the
first
time
the
substantive
due
process
question
here,
it
is
our
contention
that
there's
no
merit
whatsoever.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
a
very
reasonable
classification
for
the
state
to
him
--
to
engage
in.
the
state
can
say
that
people
who
are
on
the
lands
of
the
other
for
the
purpose
of
hunting,
fishing
and
trapping
are
a
different
class
of
people
and
that
therefore
the
law
can
be
different
with
respect
to
them
than
it
is
to
people
who
are
there
for
purposes,
say,
of
swimming.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
a
collection
of
statutes
in
some
30
states
which
have
attempted
to
address
themselves
to
this
very
problem.
there's
no
legislative
history
in
michigan
which
explains
what
the
michigan
supreme
court
have
in
mind.
there
are
in
other
cases
where
the
same
statute
has
been
enacted,
legislative
declarations
to
the
effect
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
such
a
statute
is
to
encourage
landowners
to
permit
their
private
lands
to
be
utilized
for
hunting,
fishing
and
trapping.
we
cite
a
law
review
article
in
--
it
was
contrary
being
to
the
effect
that
apparently
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
it
may
very
well
be
and
maybe
if
we
were
legislators,
we
would
not
do
it
this
way.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
seven
legislators
have
specifically
said
they
did
it
for
that
purpose
in
enacting
a
statute
similar
to
the
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
there
is
no
legislative
history
in
michigan
itself
on
that
point.
but
we
think
where
30
states
have
adopted
a
legislation
of
this
type
and
where
seven
of
those
legislators
have
indicated
that
this
is
the
purpose.
we
think
that
this
is
a
valid
legislative
purpose
and
is
not
such
invidious
discrimination
that
you
ought
to
strike
it
down.
just
as
a
matter
of
digression,
it's
interesting
to
know
that
the
plaintiff
says
that
this
is
a
change
to
the
common
law
of
michigan.
as
a
matter
of
fact
michigan
until
1957
was
one
of
the
stricter
of
the
common
law
states
which
held
that
the
rule
of
trespasses
was
applicable
even
to
minors
as
well
as
to
adults.
it
since
has
changed
probably
not
as
completely
some
of
the
other
states
but
it
has
changed
somewhat.
but
it's
interesting
that
in
1953
when
this
statute
was
enacted
the
common
law
was
still
in
effect
even
for
minors,
that
even
minors
under
the
michigan
common
law
were
not
entitled
to
protection
when
trespassing
on
the
land
of
another
unless
except
for
--
as
against
gross
negligence.
so
there
weren't
even
change
in
the
common
law.
but
in
any
event
under
the
cases
that
this
court
we
have
cited,
this
court
has
held
that
the
state
--
that
the
states
in
the
railroad
cases
can
enact
statutes
that
when
even
they're
applicable
to
children
of
five
or
seven
preclude
them
from
recovering
for
--
being
injured
when
on
the
land
of
a
railroad.
and
those
statutes
have
been
upheld
by
this
court.
on
a
procedural
point
again
we
don't
--
we
think
normally,
it
wasn't
timely
raised
but
that
there
is
no
real
point
involved.
two,
it
would've
been
better
procedure
had
we
--
had
the
statute
been
called
to
the
trial
court's
attention.
i
don't
say
that
the
fault
was
any
more
ours
than
that
of
the
plaintiff.
as
lawyers
i
think
both
sets
of
lawyers
owed
it
to
the
court
to
know
about
the
statute.
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
to
know
about
the
existence
of
the
statute.
it
had
been
--
the
statute
had
been
enacted
before
the
accidents
occurred
and
before
this
cause
of
action
was
filed.
it
was
the
responsibility
of
both
sets
of
lawyers
to
know
it.
the
fact
remains
that
it
--
at
an
appropriate
stage
of
the
proceeding
it
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
michigan
supreme
court.
the
points
were
adequately
briefed
there
by
both
sides.
the
very
contentions
that
petitioner
ultimately
raised
were
urged
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
they
we
re
fully
considered
by
the
michigan
supreme
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes,
in
his
--
for
the
respondent,
you
mean,
for
michigan
sugar?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
in
his
opening
brief
to
the
michigan
supreme
court,
he
called
the
attention
to
it
and
specifically
have
a
statement
in
it
to
the
effect
that
he
apologized
to
the
court
for
the
fact
that
he
had
just
discovered
the
existence
of
the
statute
in
preparing
his
brief
to
the
michigan
supreme
court.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
that's
right,
yes,
and
entered
it
so
that
there's
--
the
explicit
statement
of
counsel
to
the
effect
that
he
found
it
there
for
the
first
time.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
that
had
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case
called
the
attention
of
the
court
to
act
201
and
move
for
a
directed
verdict
on
the
basis
of
act
201
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
i
think
had
they
known
about
at
that
stage
the
court
would've
dismissed
the
complaint
and
then
there
would've
been
a
question
whether
they
could
in
fact
plead
a
good
cause
of
action
on
the
facts
that
they
have
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
--
under
the
statute.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
when
the
complaint
is
not
--
and
unless
they
amended
the
complaint
under
michigan
practice,
under
the
case
we
have
cited,
you
do
not
instruct
the
jury
on
gross
negligence
when
the
complaint
itself
simply
refer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
pardon?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
it
--
with
--
they've
--
whether
they
would've
attempted
to
amend
or
not,
i
don't
know.
it's
significant
that
two
of
the
five
judges
who
reversed
that
that
as
a
matter
of
law
there
wasn't
even
enough
evidence
to
show
ordinary
negligence.
so
whether
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
pardon?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
i
think
it's
extremely
likely
that
they
would
have
amended,
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
but
under
a
statute
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
they
have
been
--
if
they
have
been
so
deprived,
they've
been
deprived
by
their
own
conduct
in
overlooking
the
statute.
now,
maybe
a
state
supreme
court
in
a
different
state
would
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
i
don't
know
why
michigan
--
why
two
sets
of
michigan
lawyers
overlooked
the
statute
that
had
been
on
the
book
for
several
years.
i
mean
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
no,
no.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
we
have
not
become
counsel
on
this
case
until
the
petitions
--
until
the
brief
on
the
merits
were
filed.
so
whether
we
would've
done
better,
that's
easy
for
us
to
say
we
would've
but
we
were
not
counsel
in
the
case
and
clearly
both
sets
of
counsel
should've
known
about
it
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
statute
which
is
the
responsibility
which
the
michigan
supreme
court
has
held
is
irresponsible,
the
plaintiff
to
plea.
when
they
didn't,
the
michigan
supreme
court
said,
"you
haven't
--
not
done
so,
you're
out
of

court."
mr.
harry

plotkin
they
plead
--
they
pleaded
facts
that
had
they
known
the
statute
--
they
pleaded
facts
that
on
the
way
they
pleaded
and
the
facts
as
they
developed
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
win.

pardon?
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
the
michigan
supreme
court
--
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
plotkin
well,
all
i
can
say
is
and
i'm
not
a
practitioner
in
michigan
but
from
reading
their
cases
they
are
a
strict
court
even
though
finding
ordinary
negligence.
they
find
as
a
matter
of
law
that
whether
in
other
cases
would
be
a
clear
case
of
ordinary
negligence
to
--
at
least
one
the
title
go
to
the
jury.
they
direct
verdict
for
the
defendant.
michigan
i
think
is
a
strong
defendant
state
in
this
area
of
law
rather
than
the
plaintiff's
state.
and
two
of
the
judges
thought
that
as
a
matter
of
law
there
was
no
ordinary
negligence.
when
you
read
some
of
the
other
cases,
the
court
directs
verdict
on
ordinary
negligence
in
this
type
of
situation.
now,
it's
just
pure
--
it's
a
pure
conjuncture
how
they
will
come
out
but
this
is
a
defendant's
minded
court
on
negligence
matter.
thank
you
your
honor.
