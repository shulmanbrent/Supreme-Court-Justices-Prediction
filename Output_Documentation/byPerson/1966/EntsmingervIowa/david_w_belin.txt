mr.
david
w.
belin
honorable
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
what
constitutes
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
case
is
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
and
involves
the
issues
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
petitioner
harvey
entsminger
was
arrested
without
warrant
on
june
the
12th,
1964
on
a
traffic
violation.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
the
des
moines
police
apartment
were
looking
for
mr.
entsminger
on
an
alleged
bad
check
charge
and
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station
and
arrested
and
asked
to
leave
his
personal
effects
with
the
jailer
for
safekeeping
as
was
customary
at
the
des
moines
police
station.
included
in
these
personal
effects
which
were
placed
in
a
locker
in
a
safe
were
two
handwritten
personal
letters
written
by
the
petitioner.
two-and-a-half
weeks
after
his
arrest,
lieutenant
dawson
of
the
identification
bureau
of
the
des
moines
police
department
asked
the
petitioner
to
submit
a
sample
of
his
handwriting
and
the
petitioner
refused.
lieutenant
dawson
had
been
present
at
the
arrest
two-and-a-half
weeks
earlier.
he
remembered
that
there
were
two
letters
that
have
been
placed
in
the
safe
and
although
of
these
were
not
instrumentalities
of
any
crime
or
evidence
of
any
crime,
he
removed
these
letters
from
the
safe.
now
there's
a
dispute
in
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
voluntary
or
not
voluntary.
in
any
event,
several
months
later,
in
october
with
court-appointed
counsel,
the
indigent
harvey
enstminger
was
tried
for
the
bad
check
charge.
these
letters
were
used
as
an
important
part
of
the
chain
of
evidence.
mr.
entsminger
was
convicted.
he
was
sentenced
to
a
term
not
to
exceed
10
years
and
he
is
now
incarcerated
in
the
fort
madison
penitentiary
in
iowa.
mr.
enstminger
asked
the
court
to
appoint
a
new
lawyer
to
represent
him
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
to
file
an
appeal
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
in
the
state
of
iowa
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right,
a
new
counsel
was
appointed,
a
man
by
the
name
of
henry
warnley.
he
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and
the
motion
was
overruled
and
the
sentence
imposed.
then
mr.
warnley
had
60
days
to
file
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
within
this
60-day
period,
a
notice
was
filed.
and
that
gave
mr.
warnley
90
days
to
file
what
we
call
a
printed
record
on
appeal.
unfortunately,
at
the
end
of
february,
the
90-day
period
expired,
there
was
no
record
on
appeal
filed.
mr.
david
w.
belin
the
full
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
justice
white.
it's
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
your
honor,
justice
fortas
mr.
david
w.
belin
i
think
that
basically,
this
is
the
primary
relief
that
we
are
seeking
here
although
we
do
raise
the
additional
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
sufficient
record
before
this
court.
mr.
david
w.
belin
sufficient
record
before
this
court
because
the
actual
trial
transcript
has
been
introduced
as
an
exhibit
filed
with
the
record
on
appeal.
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
record
before
this
court
because
of
the
basis
of
the
seizure
without
warrant
of
these
personal
communication.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
belin
well
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
you're
absolutely
right,
justice
fortas.
mr.
david
w.
belin
that
the
attorney
--
the
attorney
general
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
particular
case,
the
appointed
counsel
mr.
warnley
finally
did
serve,
after
the
expiration
of
this
90-day
period,
mr.
warnley
did
served
a
notice
on
the
attorney
general
specifying
his
intent
to
file
a
record
and
a
brief
and
although
the
iowa
supreme
court
had
ordered
that
the
case
be
submitted
on
a
clerk's
transcript
which
is
not
a
transcript
of
the
record
at
all,
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
set
aside
that
order
without
prejudice
to
the
attorney
general's
office
to
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
i
think
it's
indicative
of
the
attorney
general's
office
that
they
did
not
elect
to
stand
on
the
technicality
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but
rather
wanted
to
have
the
appeal
heard
in
substance.
and
in
this
particular
case,
they
are
not
arguing
about
sending
it
down
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
although
i
think
there
might
be
some
disagreement
between
us
as
to
whether
or
not
on
the
one
hand,
we
argue,
at
least
i
argue,
that
the
clerk's
transcript
system
itself
is
either
per
se
unconstitutional
because
it
permits
this
very
thing
happening
that
happened
here,
and
by
the
way,
i
personally
have
taken
a
survey
of
the
clerk's
transcript
cases
over
the
past
15
years
in
iowa
and
out
of
several
hundred
cases,
there
has
never
been
a
reversal,
at
least
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
and
so,
i
argue
that
either
the
clerk's
transcript
system
itself
is
per
se
unconstitutional
or
in
the
alternative
it
cannot
be
used
under
douglas,
and
as
reaffirmed
this
recently
as
your
decision
on
mundy,
the
missouri
case
that
it
cannot
be
used
without
some
protection
of
the
right
for
indigent
defendants.
and
so
i
say
there
would
be
not
basic
issue
before
we
reached
the
final
issue
of
whether
or
not
we
have
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
-
the
case
occurred
here.
mr.
david
w.
belin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
belin
well
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes.
mr.
david
w.
belin
i
think
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
your
honor,
i
think
it
happens
in
both
instances.
in
this
particular
case
for
instance,
the
--
i
think
the
thing
that
perhaps
instigated
the
late
filing
of
this
notice
of
intent
to
file
the
record
was
a
letter
from
the
petitioner
to
the
court
appointed
attorney
and
the
court
appointed
attorney
wrote
back
that
your
case
was
appealed
and
as
soon
as
i
receive
the
record,
this
letter
was
a
letter
written
on
march
9.
mr.
david
w.
belin
--
they've
got
to
do
something
when
they
received
the
record
the
transcript
in
december
already.
then
later
in
october
of
the
year,
he
writes
to
the
petitioner
because
the
petitioner
has
meanwhile
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
which
was
overruled
as
being
untimely.
mr.
david
w.
belin
he
says,
that
on
the
basis
of
my
examination
of
the
record,
i
don't
think
you
have
any
basis
for
appeal
or
in
substance
this
is
what
he
says.
now
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
it
was
his
inadvertence
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
--
or
whether
or
not
he
really
felt
that.
mr.
david
w.
belin
well,
this
is
a
very
late
expression.
it's
about
several
weeks
before
the
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
your
honor,
i
think
the
basic
constitutional
issues
is
whether
or
not
the
clerk's
transcript
system
can
be
used
as
a
vehicle
by
court-appointed
counsel
because
i
don't
think
would
happen
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
in
your
--
in
your
situation,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
basis
for
appeal
because
i
don't
see
any
equal
protection
argument.
now
if
there
was
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
--
outright
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
well,
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
dangers
are
far
greater
in
court
appointed
counsel
doing
this
because
of
laziness
or
inadvertence,
whereas
i
think
that
the
retained
counsel
is
not
going
let
this
happen,
at
least
i
don't
think
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
it
does
happen,
but
i
don't
think
the
degree
is
nearly
as
great.
i
think
that
--
i
would
say
this
and
this
is
a
practical
matter,
i
think
that
often,
a
clerk's
transcript
appeal
is
used
where
there
are
perhaps
might
not
be
any
basis
for
appeal
because
it
gives
a
delay
of
several
months
within
which
the
defendant
might
be
able
to
place
as
[voice
overlap]
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
if
this
were
a
conscientious
effort
to
do
it.
as
i
don't
happen
to
think
it
was
in
the
enstminger
case
and
i
don't
happen
to
think
it
is
in
the
great
majority
of
indigent
cases.
mr.
david
w.
belin
i
think
that
the
likelihood
of
a
--
of
a
retained
lawyer
through
neglect
letting
a
clerk's
transcript
system
arise
is
much
less
than
the
likelihood
of
a
court-appointed
lawyer.
mr.
david
w.
belin
i
think
it
makes
a
constitutional
difference
to
the
extent
that
if
the
man
could
have
retained
a
lawyer,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
happened
nearly
as
much
as
it
might
have
happened
in
the
other
situation,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
happen
to
think
that
perhaps
this
should
happen
in
--
in
appointed
counsel
cases
also
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
--
but
again,
you
have
--
it's
a
question
of
judgment.
i
think
the
only
issue
really
is
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
one
lawyer
to
make
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
is
merit
and
i
think
that
we
would
--
at
least
i
would
submit
that
i
think
the
lawyer
is
going
to
make
a
better
calculated
decision
if
he's
actually
on
a
retainer
as
opposed
to
a
situation
where
you
might
look
on
this
as
a
burden
upon
this
time
because
he's
accepting
the
duty.
i
mean,
he
theoretically
shouldn't
but
yes,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
the
situation
does
arise.
mr.
david
w.
belin
no.
and
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
that's
correct,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
tragedy
here
was
that
there
actually
was
a
full
transcript
of
the
trial
court
record
available
at
the
time
it
went
up
on
the
clerk,
–
at
the
time
the
iowa
supreme
court
ordered
it
to
submit
on
the
clerk's
transcript.
but
the
clerk's
transcript
does
not
require
imprinted
abstract
of
record
at
all
and
so
we
have
the
error
in
douglas
compounded
because
in
douglas,
at
least
there
was
a
record
on
appeal.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
record
on
appeal
and
that's
why
i
really
argue
in
essence
that
the
system
itself
is
per
se
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
if
--
the
reason
that
i
argue
that
this
--
that
the
clerk's
transcript
system
is
really
per
se
unconstitutional
is
that
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
have
an
appeal
in
form
that's
totally
void
of
substance.
that's
totally
void
of
a
record
on
appeal
apart
from
totally
void
of
a
brief
and
argument.
and
even
if
it's
a
conscious
decision
on
the
part
of
counsel
whether
he
be
retained
or
appointed
counsel,
i
don't
think
we
want
to
have
a
judiciary
system
where
we
have
this
sub
rows
of
form
of
appeal.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
this
time
for
any
rebuttal
although
i
think
there's
going
to
be
too
much
to
rebut
because
i
think
both
the
attorney
general's
office
and
at
least
i
feel
that
in
this
particular
instance
that
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
were
violated,
there
is
a
question
of
what
to
do
with
the
clerk's
transcript
system
itself.
mr.
david
w.
belin
i'd
like
to
make
two
comments
if
i
may,
first
with
regard
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
i
think
it's
the
duty
of
all
appointed
counsel
to
raise
every
possible
issue
for
submission
to
this
court.
and
to
the
extent
that
i
feel
that
there
are
substantial
errors
in
the
merits,
i've
done
this,
number
one
for
the
inherent
issues
themselves
and
number
two,
to
show
the
failures
of
the
clerk's
transcript
system
which
wouldn't
disclose
any
of
these
errors
whether
its
appointed
counsel
or
whether
it's
retained
counsel
or
anything
else
and
i
think
the
inherent
defect
of
the
clerk's
transcript
system
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
that's
the
very
point
your
honor.
the
--
the
fact
that
with
these
issues,
there
was
no
substantive
appeal
even
assuming
that
the
counsel
would
have
been
a
retained
counsel.
i
think,
it
creates
the
issues
of
equal
protection
and
also
the
question
about
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
and
that's
why
i've
urged
that
the
system
itself
of
a
clerk's
transcript
appeal
where
there
was
no
record
on
appeal
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
and
of
course
the
fact
that
there's
never
been
a
reversal,
i
think
is
indicative
of
the
kind
of
practical
operation
this
system
has
that
there
is
not
been
a
reversal
of
a
clerk's
transcript
appeal
at
least
in
the
15
years
that
i
know
of.
mr.
david
w.
belin
your
honor,
my
personal
belief
is
it
there
should
be
because
i
don't
think
that
there
has
been
in
the
one
appeal
that
the
defendant
has
as
a
matter
of
right.
if
there
is
negligence
on
retained
counsel,
or
negligence
on
appointed
counsel,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
say
that
this
constitutes
an
appeal.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
i
would
say
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
both
situations.
and
i
think
you
know
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
no
presentation
of
either
a
record
or
a
brief
--
or
brief
in
arguments,
so
that
the
court
itself
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
failure
to
file
a
record,
fail
to
file
a
brief
in
argument
while
knowingly,
in
a
state
procedure
that
it
really
be
--
it's
the
state
procedure
itself
that
permits
this
thing
to
happen.
mr.
david
w.
belin
in
the
appointed
counsel
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
in
the
retained
counsel
there
is
a
question
of
state
action.
i
don't
know
if
you
could
or
could
not
charge
it.
you
can
have
state
action
where
the
state
appoints
a
counsel,
and
particularly
in
this
case
where
the
state
was
aware
for
this
petition
for
certiorari.
i
think
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
you
can
charge
the
state
with
state
action
where
it
retained
counsel.
mr.
david
w.
belin
pardon?
mr.
david
w.
belin
if
--
if
the
--
if
the
state
were
aware
of
the
fact
ahead
of
time
as
it
was
in
this
case
because
the
petition
for
certiorari,
if
you
remove
--
i
mean
the
petition
of
certiorari
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
where
mr.
enstminger
–-
mr.
david
w.
belin
pardon?
mr.
david
w.
belin
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
the
counsel
--
the
fact
that
the
counsel
doesn't
file
a
paper
makes
it
a
constitutional
defect.
mr.
david
w.
belin
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
could
have
been
--
it
could
have
happened
here.
but
at
least,
if
that
would
have
happened,
you
wouldn't
not
have
had
a
formal
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
affirming
the
conviction
and
i
think
the
fatal
defect
of
the
clerk's
transcript
system
is
that
instead
of
dismissing
it
which
i
think
they
could
do
if
they
were
to
dismiss
it
what
they
do
is
that
they
affirm
they
wouldn't
appeal
the
man
has
as
a
matter
of
right
under
--
under
the
period
--
the
one
paragraph,
one
paragraph
per
curium
opinion
says
based
on
the
record,
we
have
before
us,
we
find
no
error.
in
other
words,
that's
the
way
the
opinion
was
in
this
case.
and
my
position
is
that
the
clerk's
transcript
system
doesn't
permit
a
record.
this
as
justice
stewart
says
that
theoretically,
it's
possible
to
have
an
error
shown
so
far
as
instructions
are
concerned,
but
in
practice,
it
just
doesn't
work
that
way.
mr.
david
w.
belin
well,
yes
--
yes,
your
honor.
you
can
find
the
actual
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
page
27
that
mr.
enstminger
wrote
of
the
record
on
the
ground
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
--
record,
yes,
your
honor.
and
you
see
he
knows
how
he
was
charged
with
the
crime
and
he
makes
the
claim
with
regard
to
the
use
of
his
papers.
and
mr.
enstminger
then
points
out
the
appointment
of
the
attorney
and
on
page
28
of
record,
you
can
see
that
mr.
enstminger
assumes
that
there
was
a
record
filed
but
no
brief.
what
mr.
enstminger
didn't
know
when
he
did
that
is
that
there
was
no
record
filed
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
that
was
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
and
the
opinion
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
well,
the
--
the
dismissal
of
the
petition
for
writ
was
on
october
18
and
the
opinion
was
on
october
19th.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes
sir.
by
the
way
in
the
record,
i
might
say
there
is
a
typographical
error
in
the
record
that
shows
in
the
record
itself,
i
think
in
one
portion
of
the
opinion
was
on
october
10th,
actually
it's
on
october
19th
--
and
i
think
in
our
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general
that
shows
october
19th.
mr.
david
w.
belin
honorable
chief
justice
and
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
what
constitutes
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
case
is
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
and
involves
the
issues
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
the
petitioner
harvey
entsminger
was
arrested
without
warrant
on
june
the
12th,
1964
on
a
traffic
violation.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
the
des
moines
police
apartment
were
looking
for
mr.
entsminger
on
an
alleged
bad
check
charge
and
he
was
taken
to
the
police
station
and
arrested
and
asked
to
leave
his
personal
effects
with
the
jailer
for
safekeeping
as
was
customary
at
the
des
moines
police
station.
included
in
these
personal
effects
which
were
placed
in
a
locker
in
a
safe
were
two
handwritten
personal
letters
written
by
the
petitioner.
two-and-a-half
weeks
after
his
arrest,
lieutenant
dawson
of
the
identification
bureau
of
the
des
moines
police
department
asked
the
petitioner
to
submit
a
sample
of
his
handwriting
and
the
petitioner
refused.
lieutenant
dawson
had
been
present
at
the
arrest
two-and-a-half
weeks
earlier.
he
remembered
that
there
were
two
letters
that
have
been
placed
in
the
safe
and
although
of
these
were
not
instrumentalities
of
any
crime
or
evidence
of
any
crime,
he
removed
these
letters
from
the
safe.
now
there's
a
dispute
in
the
record
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
voluntary
or
not
voluntary.
in
any
event,
several
months
later,
in
october
with
court-appointed
counsel,
the
indigent
harvey
enstminger
was
tried
for
the
bad
check
charge.
these
letters
were
used
as
an
important
part
of
the
chain
of
evidence.
mr.
entsminger
was
convicted.
he
was
sentenced
to
a
term
not
to
exceed
10
years
and
he
is
now
incarcerated
in
the
fort
madison
penitentiary
in
iowa.
mr.
enstminger
asked
the
court
to
appoint
a
new
lawyer
to
represent
him
to
file
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
to
file
an
appeal
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
in
the
state
of
iowa
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right,
a
new
counsel
was
appointed,
a
man
by
the
name
of
henry
warnley.
he
filed
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
and
the
motion
was
overruled
and
the
sentence
imposed.
then
mr.
warnley
had
60
days
to
file
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
a
notice
of
appeal,
and
within
this
60-day
period,
a
notice
was
filed.
and
that
gave
mr.
warnley
90
days
to
file
what
we
call
a
printed
record
on
appeal.
unfortunately,
at
the
end
of
february,
the
90-day
period
expired,
there
was
no
record
on
appeal
filed.
mr.
david
w.
belin
the
full
record,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
justice
white.
it's
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
your
honor,
justice
fortas
mr.
david
w.
belin
i
think
that
basically,
this
is
the
primary
relief
that
we
are
seeking
here
although
we
do
raise
the
additional
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
sufficient
record
before
this
court.
mr.
david
w.
belin
sufficient
record
before
this
court
because
the
actual
trial
transcript
has
been
introduced
as
an
exhibit
filed
with
the
record
on
appeal.
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
record
before
this
court
because
of
the
basis
of
the
seizure
without
warrant
of
these
personal
communication.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
belin
well
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
you're
absolutely
right,
justice
fortas.
mr.
david
w.
belin
that
the
attorney
--
the
attorney
general
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
particular
case,
the
appointed
counsel
mr.
warnley
finally
did
serve,
after
the
expiration
of
this
90-day
period,
mr.
warnley
did
served
a
notice
on
the
attorney
general
specifying
his
intent
to
file
a
record
and
a
brief
and
although
the
iowa
supreme
court
had
ordered
that
the
case
be
submitted
on
a
clerk's
transcript
which
is
not
a
transcript
of
the
record
at
all,
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
set
aside
that
order
without
prejudice
to
the
attorney
general's
office
to
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
i
think
it's
indicative
of
the
attorney
general's
office
that
they
did
not
elect
to
stand
on
the
technicality
of
a
motion
to
dismiss,
but
rather
wanted
to
have
the
appeal
heard
in
substance.
and
in
this
particular
case,
they
are
not
arguing
about
sending
it
down
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
although
i
think
there
might
be
some
disagreement
between
us
as
to
whether
or
not
on
the
one
hand,
we
argue,
at
least
i
argue,
that
the
clerk's
transcript
system
itself
is
either
per
se
unconstitutional
because
it
permits
this
very
thing
happening
that
happened
here,
and
by
the
way,
i
personally
have
taken
a
survey
of
the
clerk's
transcript
cases
over
the
past
15
years
in
iowa
and
out
of
several
hundred
cases,
there
has
never
been
a
reversal,
at
least
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
and
so,
i
argue
that
either
the
clerk's
transcript
system
itself
is
per
se
unconstitutional
or
in
the
alternative
it
cannot
be
used
under
douglas,
and
as
reaffirmed
this
recently
as
your
decision
on
mundy,
the
missouri
case
that
it
cannot
be
used
without
some
protection
of
the
right
for
indigent
defendants.
and
so
i
say
there
would
be
not
basic
issue
before
we
reached
the
final
issue
of
whether
or
not
we
have
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
-
the
case
occurred
here.
mr.
david
w.
belin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
belin
well
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes.
mr.
david
w.
belin
i
think
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
your
honor,
i
think
it
happens
in
both
instances.
in
this
particular
case
for
instance,
the
--
i
think
the
thing
that
perhaps
instigated
the
late
filing
of
this
notice
of
intent
to
file
the
record
was
a
letter
from
the
petitioner
to
the
court
appointed
attorney
and
the
court
appointed
attorney
wrote
back
that
your
case
was
appealed
and
as
soon
as
i
receive
the
record,
this
letter
was
a
letter
written
on
march
9.
mr.
david
w.
belin
--
they've
got
to
do
something
when
they
received
the
record
the
transcript
in
december
already.
then
later
in
october
of
the
year,
he
writes
to
the
petitioner
because
the
petitioner
has
meanwhile
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
which
was
overruled
as
being
untimely.
mr.
david
w.
belin
he
says,
that
on
the
basis
of
my
examination
of
the
record,
i
don't
think
you
have
any
basis
for
appeal
or
in
substance
this
is
what
he
says.
now
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
it
was
his
inadvertence
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
--
or
whether
or
not
he
really
felt
that.
mr.
david
w.
belin
well,
this
is
a
very
late
expression.
it's
about
several
weeks
before
the
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
your
honor,
i
think
the
basic
constitutional
issues
is
whether
or
not
the
clerk's
transcript
system
can
be
used
as
a
vehicle
by
court-appointed
counsel
because
i
don't
think
would
happen
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
in
your
--
in
your
situation,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
basis
for
appeal
because
i
don't
see
any
equal
protection
argument.
now
if
there
was
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
--
outright
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
well,
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
dangers
are
far
greater
in
court
appointed
counsel
doing
this
because
of
laziness
or
inadvertence,
whereas
i
think
that
the
retained
counsel
is
not
going
let
this
happen,
at
least
i
don't
think
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
it
does
happen,
but
i
don't
think
the
degree
is
nearly
as
great.
i
think
that
--
i
would
say
this
and
this
is
a
practical
matter,
i
think
that
often,
a
clerk's
transcript
appeal
is
used
where
there
are
perhaps
might
not
be
any
basis
for
appeal
because
it
gives
a
delay
of
several
months
within
which
the
defendant
might
be
able
to
place
as
[voice
overlap]
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
if
this
were
a
conscientious
effort
to
do
it.
as
i
don't
happen
to
think
it
was
in
the
enstminger
case
and
i
don't
happen
to
think
it
is
in
the
great
majority
of
indigent
cases.
mr.
david
w.
belin
i
think
that
the
likelihood
of
a
--
of
a
retained
lawyer
through
neglect
letting
a
clerk's
transcript
system
arise
is
much
less
than
the
likelihood
of
a
court-appointed
lawyer.
mr.
david
w.
belin
i
think
it
makes
a
constitutional
difference
to
the
extent
that
if
the
man
could
have
retained
a
lawyer,
i
don't
think
it
would
have
happened
nearly
as
much
as
it
might
have
happened
in
the
other
situation,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
happen
to
think
that
perhaps
this
should
happen
in
--
in
appointed
counsel
cases
also
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
--
but
again,
you
have
--
it's
a
question
of
judgment.
i
think
the
only
issue
really
is
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
one
lawyer
to
make
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
there
is
merit
and
i
think
that
we
would
--
at
least
i
would
submit
that
i
think
the
lawyer
is
going
to
make
a
better
calculated
decision
if
he's
actually
on
a
retainer
as
opposed
to
a
situation
where
you
might
look
on
this
as
a
burden
upon
this
time
because
he's
accepting
the
duty.
i
mean,
he
theoretically
shouldn't
but
yes,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
think
the
situation
does
arise.
mr.
david
w.
belin
no.
and
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
that's
correct,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
tragedy
here
was
that
there
actually
was
a
full
transcript
of
the
trial
court
record
available
at
the
time
it
went
up
on
the
clerk,
–
at
the
time
the
iowa
supreme
court
ordered
it
to
submit
on
the
clerk's
transcript.
but
the
clerk's
transcript
does
not
require
imprinted
abstract
of
record
at
all
and
so
we
have
the
error
in
douglas
compounded
because
in
douglas,
at
least
there
was
a
record
on
appeal.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
record
on
appeal
and
that's
why
i
really
argue
in
essence
that
the
system
itself
is
per
se
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
if
--
the
reason
that
i
argue
that
this
--
that
the
clerk's
transcript
system
is
really
per
se
unconstitutional
is
that
i
don't
think
you
ought
to
have
an
appeal
in
form
that's
totally
void
of
substance.
that's
totally
void
of
a
record
on
appeal
apart
from
totally
void
of
a
brief
and
argument.
and
even
if
it's
a
conscious
decision
on
the
part
of
counsel
whether
he
be
retained
or
appointed
counsel,
i
don't
think
we
want
to
have
a
judiciary
system
where
we
have
this
sub
rows
of
form
of
appeal.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
this
time
for
any
rebuttal
although
i
think
there's
going
to
be
too
much
to
rebut
because
i
think
both
the
attorney
general's
office
and
at
least
i
feel
that
in
this
particular
instance
that
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
were
violated,
there
is
a
question
of
what
to
do
with
the
clerk's
transcript
system
itself.
mr.
david
w.
belin
i'd
like
to
make
two
comments
if
i
may,
first
with
regard
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
i
think
it's
the
duty
of
all
appointed
counsel
to
raise
every
possible
issue
for
submission
to
this
court.
and
to
the
extent
that
i
feel
that
there
are
substantial
errors
in
the
merits,
i've
done
this,
number
one
for
the
inherent
issues
themselves
and
number
two,
to
show
the
failures
of
the
clerk's
transcript
system
which
wouldn't
disclose
any
of
these
errors
whether
its
appointed
counsel
or
whether
it's
retained
counsel
or
anything
else
and
i
think
the
inherent
defect
of
the
clerk's
transcript
system
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
that's
the
very
point
your
honor.
the
--
the
fact
that
with
these
issues,
there
was
no
substantive
appeal
even
assuming
that
the
counsel
would
have
been
a
retained
counsel.
i
think,
it
creates
the
issues
of
equal
protection
and
also
the
question
about
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
and
that's
why
i've
urged
that
the
system
itself
of
a
clerk's
transcript
appeal
where
there
was
no
record
on
appeal
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
and
of
course
the
fact
that
there's
never
been
a
reversal,
i
think
is
indicative
of
the
kind
of
practical
operation
this
system
has
that
there
is
not
been
a
reversal
of
a
clerk's
transcript
appeal
at
least
in
the
15
years
that
i
know
of.
mr.
david
w.
belin
your
honor,
my
personal
belief
is
it
there
should
be
because
i
don't
think
that
there
has
been
in
the
one
appeal
that
the
defendant
has
as
a
matter
of
right.
if
there
is
negligence
on
retained
counsel,
or
negligence
on
appointed
counsel,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
say
that
this
constitutes
an
appeal.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
i
would
say
effective
assistance
of
counsel
in
both
situations.
and
i
think
you
know
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
no
presentation
of
either
a
record
or
a
brief
--
or
brief
in
arguments,
so
that
the
court
itself
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
failure
to
file
a
record,
fail
to
file
a
brief
in
argument
while
knowingly,
in
a
state
procedure
that
it
really
be
--
it's
the
state
procedure
itself
that
permits
this
thing
to
happen.
mr.
david
w.
belin
in
the
appointed
counsel
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
in
the
retained
counsel
there
is
a
question
of
state
action.
i
don't
know
if
you
could
or
could
not
charge
it.
you
can
have
state
action
where
the
state
appoints
a
counsel,
and
particularly
in
this
case
where
the
state
was
aware
for
this
petition
for
certiorari.
i
think
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
you
can
charge
the
state
with
state
action
where
it
retained
counsel.
mr.
david
w.
belin
pardon?
mr.
david
w.
belin
if
--
if
the
--
if
the
state
were
aware
of
the
fact
ahead
of
time
as
it
was
in
this
case
because
the
petition
for
certiorari,
if
you
remove
--
i
mean
the
petition
of
certiorari
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
where
mr.
enstminger
–-
mr.
david
w.
belin
pardon?
mr.
david
w.
belin
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
the
counsel
--
the
fact
that
the
counsel
doesn't
file
a
paper
makes
it
a
constitutional
defect.
mr.
david
w.
belin
that's
correct
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
could
have
been
--
it
could
have
happened
here.
but
at
least,
if
that
would
have
happened,
you
wouldn't
not
have
had
a
formal
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
affirming
the
conviction
and
i
think
the
fatal
defect
of
the
clerk's
transcript
system
is
that
instead
of
dismissing
it
which
i
think
they
could
do
if
they
were
to
dismiss
it
what
they
do
is
that
they
affirm
they
wouldn't
appeal
the
man
has
as
a
matter
of
right
under
--
under
the
period
--
the
one
paragraph,
one
paragraph
per
curium
opinion
says
based
on
the
record,
we
have
before
us,
we
find
no
error.
in
other
words,
that's
the
way
the
opinion
was
in
this
case.
and
my
position
is
that
the
clerk's
transcript
system
doesn't
permit
a
record.
this
as
justice
stewart
says
that
theoretically,
it's
possible
to
have
an
error
shown
so
far
as
instructions
are
concerned,
but
in
practice,
it
just
doesn't
work
that
way.
mr.
david
w.
belin
well,
yes
--
yes,
your
honor.
you
can
find
the
actual
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
page
27
that
mr.
enstminger
wrote
of
the
record
on
the
ground
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
--
record,
yes,
your
honor.
and
you
see
he
knows
how
he
was
charged
with
the
crime
and
he
makes
the
claim
with
regard
to
the
use
of
his
papers.
and
mr.
enstminger
then
points
out
the
appointment
of
the
attorney
and
on
page
28
of
record,
you
can
see
that
mr.
enstminger
assumes
that
there
was
a
record
filed
but
no
brief.
what
mr.
enstminger
didn't
know
when
he
did
that
is
that
there
was
no
record
filed
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
that
was
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes,
and
the
opinion
--
mr.
david
w.
belin
well,
the
--
the
dismissal
of
the
petition
for
writ
was
on
october
18
and
the
opinion
was
on
october
19th.
mr.
david
w.
belin
yes
sir.
by
the
way
in
the
record,
i
might
say
there
is
a
typographical
error
in
the
record
that
shows
in
the
record
itself,
i
think
in
one
portion
of
the
opinion
was
on
october
10th,
actually
it's
on
october
19th
--
and
i
think
in
our
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
the
attorney
general
that
shows
october
19th.
