mr.
charles
s.
moses
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
argument
presented
before
this
court,
there
was
an
issue
raised
that
i
would
like
to
respond
specifically
to.
in
benton
v.
maryland,
the
court
said
that
the
same
constitutional
standards
apply
against
both
the
state
and
the
federal
government.
as
i
see
this
case,
this
is
an
effort
to
spin
off
the
non-constitutional
baggage
of
the
benton
decision.
that
is
the
way
i
see
it.
in
other
words,
we
are
trying
to
create
a
non-constitutional
parsing
of
what
benton
v.
maryland
has
said.
now,
that
may
be
fine,
but
i
think
that
is
what
the
issue
is
as
i
see
it.
we
are
trying
to
say
that
it
is
a
non-constitutional
issue
as
to
how
this
constitution
should
be
applied
in
the
state
of
montana.
i
see
that
as
the
issue.
now,
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
valid
theory.
i
do
not
think
the
state
of
montana
either
legislatively
or
judicially
should
be
examining
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
to
determine
what
is
non-constitutional
baggage
in
terms
of
time.
the
supreme
court
applies
the
rule.
it
decides
when
the
constitutional
rule
should
be
applied
and
the
states
and
the
legislatures
should
follow
it
in
my
judgment.
now,
the
question
is
also
raised
as
to
whether
there
is
any
significant
difference
as
to
the
time
when
jeopardy
attaches.
i
think
it
is
a
very
important
question.
let
me
suggest
one
point
to
you
before
i
approach
that
question
and
that
is
the
burden
of
proof.
it
used
to
be
and
perhaps
i
am
adopting
from
the
equal
protection
cases
the
rule
of
compelling
state
interest
or
at
least
some
rationale
rule.
what
we
are
doing
here
is
not
justifying,
the
state
is
not
up
here
justifying
and
saying
there
is
some
compelling
need
not
to
have
this
rule
that
has
been
announced
in
downum
and
somerville
and
all
of
the
rest.
there
is
some
compelling
reason
in
the
state
of
montana
why
we
should
not
have
this
rule.
so
that
when
we
talk
about
the
difference,
i
to
not
want
to
be
on
the
defensive
by
simply
saying
to
you
that
maybe
i
can
satisfy
you
as
to
the
significant
difference
and
maybe
i
cannot.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
that
is,
all
statutes
are
presumed
constitutional,
but
that
is
one
of
the
problems
we
get,
if
i
may
just
make
a
brief
comment
on
that
point.
in
the
state
of
montana,
we
have
conclusive
presumption
contrary
to
murray
v.
u.s.
and
the
teachings
of
the
supreme
court.
so
that
if
we
take
the
rule
in
montana
that
we
have
a
presumption
to
that
effect
which
is
conclusive,
then
we
have
presumptions
which
are
again
non-constitutional
issues.
you
see
my
point
is
that
the
states
in
my
view
sir,
we
have
that
presumption,
but
if
you
were
to
apply
it
in
the
state
of
montana,
you
would
find
it
conclusive
in
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
moses
yes,
i
understand
the
point.
i
am
going
to
make
that
extra
point
in
that
it
is
my
judgment
that
state
of
montana
does
not
follow
at
all
the
supreme
court
decision.
you
are
right
there
is
that
presumption,
but
my
understanding
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
depart
from
the
constitution
you
must
show
some
compelling
reason
for
doing
so.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
well,
that
is
why
the
issue
is
very
narrowly
drawn
in
this
case
your
honor
because
if
the
supreme
court
in
downum,
somerville
and
all
the
others,
if
that
is
an
application
of
the
supreme
court
then
the
state
of
montana
cannot
change
it,
that
is
clear.
the
issue
in
this
case
seems
to
be
as
to
whether
we
can
take
of
a
portion
of
what
the
court
has
said
and
say
that
that
is
non-constitutional
baggage.
now,
that
is
as
i
see
it.
if
it
is
a
non-constitutional
issue
as
to
the
time
when
jeopardy
attaches
then
of
course
there
is
not
any
significance
and
of
course
the
thing
can
apply.
when
you
talk
about
the
question
of
whether
there
is
any
significant
difference,
the
question
is
whether
you
have
a
valued
right
to
have
his
trial
completed
by
a
particular
tribunal
that
us
v.
jorn
and
us
v.
sisson.
i
think
there
is
some
merit
as
to
permitting
the
prosecution
a
preemptory
challenge
to
the
entire
panel.
i
think
there
is
a
lack
of
reciprocity,
perhaps
like
in
voir
dire.
what
i
am
saying
to
the
court
i
think
is
simply
that
that
issue
was
addressed
to
the
court
in
the
issue
by
mr.
chief
justice
tuttle
in
this
particular
manner
in
which
he
said
on
page
15
is
that
the
valued
right
to
have
this
trial
completed
by
a
particular
tribunal
independent
of
the
threat
of
bad
faith
conduct
by
the
judge
or
prosecutor.
now,
i
take
that
to
mean
that
you
are
entitled
to
the
double
jeopardy
argument
regardless
of
whether
the
discretion
of
the
court
in
dismissing
was
in
good
faith
or
in
bad
faith.
i
think
that
when
we
come
to
a
valued
right,
the
question
is
simply,
is
the
person
in
jeopardy
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn.
i
think
that
he
is.
i
think
the
opportunity
to
have
preemptory
challenge
to
the
entire
panel,
in
our
state,
we
are
now
giving
some
preliminary
instructions
as
to
what
the
law
is
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
opening
statements
in
which
there
are
outlines
of
what
they
intended
to
prove.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
in
my
judgment
it
is
subject
to
permission
by
the
trial
court.
i
do
not
think
he
has
an
absolute
right,
no
sir.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
i
think
is
is
a
point
well
made
by
mr.
keller.
i
think
that
is
true,
but
i
think
it
points
out
the
problems
that
we
are
having.
we
are
just
taking
another
single
step
down
the
line,
but
the
manipulation
according
to
justice
tuttle,
the
right
here
preserved
is
independent
of
the
threat
of
bad
faith
conduct
by
judge
or
prosecutor,
whatever
they
do,
jeopardy
has
attached.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
i
do
not
think
so,
but
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
point
completely.
the
pre
trial
motions
and
everything
that
is
done
ordinarily
is
done
before
the
selection
of
the
jury.
we
had
two
judges
to
rule
on
these
motions
that
we
urged
and
urged
and
urged.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
those
motions
were
evidentiary
in
nature
only.
what
i
do
is
that
i
present
all
of
my
pretrial
motions.
i
argue
them
again
and
again
and
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
i
have
the
motions
in
limine.
now,
i
could
have
waited,
there
is
no
question,
i
could
have
waited
until
the
first
witness,
that
was
not
the
issue
at
that
particular
time.
it
was
not
the
issue.
it
was
not
ingenious.
my
issue
was
at
that
time
that
the
entire
nine
counts
did
not
stayed
a
claim
for
relief
and
they
dismissed
all
of
them,
but
the
two
of
them
and
i
am
still
maintaining,
despite
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
the
first
count
was
never
any
good
and
that
was
the
issue.
and
i
felt
that
ought
to
be
resolved
because
if
you
had
to
go
on
with
the
case
with
the
other
five
counts
then
it
is
difficult
under
ashe
v.
swenson
and
turner
v.
arkansas
to
go
back
and
try
the
other
issues
that
had
been
kicked
out
by
the
court
and
i
put
that
in
my
brief
and
addressed
it
to
the
attention
of
the
attorney
general
and
to
the
court.
here
is
the
dilemma,
let
us
go
to
the
supreme
court
and
get
it
all
decided.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
no
sir
i
did
not.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
sir
and
the
reason
that
i
do
not
know
--
mr.
charles
s.
moses
no
sir,
i
know
of
no
law
that
prevents
it.
the
attorney
general
at
that
time
argued
that
motions
in
limine
were
unknown
to
the
state
of
montana
as
far
as
evidentiary
rules
are
concerned.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
no
sir.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
my
motions
that
were
presented
before
two
courts
prior
to
any
having
the
trial
commence.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
no
sir.
i
presented
these
motions
in
full,
supported
by
briefs
that
there
was
not
under
any
of
the
counts
sufficient
claim
for
a
criminal
violation.
those
motions
were
not
defeated
twice.
then
i
went
into
court
after
the
jury
had
been
empaneled
and
sworn
to
be
consistent.
alright,
if
that
is
your
view
that
they
do
state
a
cause
of
action
then
my
motions
were
to
require
them
to
prove
the
venue
as
laid,
to
prove
that
there
were
false
and
forged
documents.
those
were
the
nature
of
my
objections
and
also
to
confine
them
to
the
proof
of
a
particular
time
of
which
i
happen
to
think
would
not
win,
but
the
other
motions
where
what
was
important
preparing
false
evidence,
those
motions
in
limine,
that
was
what
--
mr.
charles
s.
moses
well,
they
have
extracted
that
from
my
point
of
view,
so
that
was
not
the
vitality
of
the
motions
that
were
presented.
for
instance
in
montana,
you
have
to
determine
whether
the
time
is
relevant,
whether
it
is
significant
and
whether
you
can
prove
it
in
sometime
prior
to
five
years
before
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
i
really
did
not
think
that
was
that
relevant.
i
think
it
is
necessary
when
they
do
not,
when
it
is
consistent
with
pretrial
motions
and
we
have
argued
vigorously
and
supported
in
our
trial
brief.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
oh!
yes,
ultimately
dismissal
of
these
other
counts.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
i
disagree
with
that
sir.
the
state
had
evidence
of
those
charges
as
to
that
particular
time.
there
was
the
filing
of
the
application.
there
was
other
information
submitted.
there
was
a
final
settlement
in
the
workmen’s
compensation
covering
a
spectrum
of
time
of
almost
a
year.
they
could
have
prevailed
on
the
first
application
to
show
that
it
was
fraudulent
within
the
time
span
stated.
mr.
charles
s.
moses
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
sir,
no
sir.
i
think
one
of
the,
to
conclude
my
argument,
one
of
the
things
that
concerned
me
theoretically
if
i
may
place
it
it
in
that
light
is
the
question
of
raising
non-constitutional
issues
as
a
theory
to
be
adopted
by
this
court.
for
instance,
i
think
justice
stewart
addressed
the
attention
to
williams
v.
florida
and
apodaca
v.
oregon.
it
is
necessary
i
think
to
approach
that
directly.
is
there
a
difference
or
a
distinction
between
those
cases
and
this
case?
i
happen
to
believe
that
there
are.
first
of
all,
we
have
an
authoritative
statement
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
as
to
this
particular
issue.
in
other
words,
that
jeopardy
attaches
when
the
jury
is
empaneled
and
sworn.
i
think
that
is
a
difference
and
a
distinction.
there
was
something
bag
and
baggage,
that
was
a
part
of
double
jeopardy
as
enunciated
by
the
supreme
court.
i
think
that
is
a
difference
and
the
distinction
in
williams
v.
florida
and
apodaca.
furthermore,
it
is
my
belief
that
there
is
a
difference
because
the
application,
the
court
is
called
upon
to
apply
this
constitutional
standard
and
the
question
is
when
should
it
be
applied.
it
is
implicit
in
the
constitutional
provision
itself
as
to
when
it
should
be
applied
and
i
think
that
that
makes
it
–
it
involves
itself
more
than
the
issues
raised
on
just
those
jury
issues.
for
those
reasons
and
others,
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
