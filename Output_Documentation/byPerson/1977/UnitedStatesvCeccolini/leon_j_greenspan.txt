mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
before
this
court
probably
one
of
the
most
perplexing
and
intriguing
questions.
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
ever
come
across.
unfortunately
like
many
simple
things,
there
are
very
complex
and
like
many
complex
things
they
are
very
simple.
to
me
it
is
simply
illogical
to
differentiate
between
the
fruit
of
the
poison
tree
as
being
live
witness
testimony
or
being
physical
evidence
or
being
documentary
evidence.
to
me
the
analysis
is
whether
or
not
there
was
an
intervening
superseding
cause
of
some
vested
nature,
then
there
is
attenuation,
then
the
evidence
whether
be
live
witness
testimony
or
whether
it
be
documents
or
physical
evidence
may
thus
be
used.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
every
witness
has
an
obligation
to
testify
and
the
court
is
open
to
every
man
and
every
woman's
testimony.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
that
would
be
the
witness
and
that
is
where
you
differentiate
perhaps
your
honor
between
a
witness
whose
testimony
--
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
of
course,
a
package
of
heroin
is
before
the
court
and
it
can
be
examined
and
whether
it
says
what
it
says
what
it
says
or
it
does
not
say
anything
is
of
course
a
matter
of
scientific
determination.
now,
there
is
a
question
of
compulsion,
there
is
a
question
of
abolition
and
when
you
have
live
witness
testimony
but
i
think
the
only
differentiation
that
can
be
made
is
the
one
that
has
been
made
by
this
court
and
by
the
other.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
what
matter
would
have
been
your
honor,
if
that
was
the
personal
right
that
she
had
and
that
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
the
evidence
could
or
should
be
used
against
the
witness,
against
the
defendant
your
honor.
my
position,
i
think
that
the
position
this
court
has
taken
and
if
it
has
not
taken
it
should
take
it,
simply
that
you
cannot
have
any
type
of
attenuation
of
a
live
witness
testimony
merely
because
that
witness
as
the
government
would
argue
volunteers
after
the
discovery.
now,
i
do
not
believe
that
is
a
logical
position
and
if
the
government
argues
it
i
should
expect
this
court
to
reject
it
out
of
hand.
i
would
like
the
court
to
examine
if
it
will,
what
it
started
out
in
the
beginning
to
examine
the
question
of
appealablity
of
this
so
called
judgment
or
order.
if
your
honor,
this
court
would
please
examine
the
question,
i
think
that
what
the
second
circuit
really
had
before
it
was
a
suppression
order,
there
was
no
judgment
entered,
there
was
no
order
entered,
there
was
merely
a
decision
by
the
court.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
yes
mr.
justice
and
i
believe
i
am
able
to
raise
it
because
i
believe
as
i
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
the
government
under
any
event
should
be
stopped
from
even
exercising
this
right
of
appeal
because
it
is
not
an
equitable
conduct
that
created
this
technical
right.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
would
agree
your
honor,
however
i
think
the
question
of
jurisdiction
well
known
is
well
before
this
court
without
any
question
of
cross-petition,
just
as
the
doctrine
of
the
inequitable
conduct
is
always
before
this
court
or
before
any
court.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
believe
we
can
your
honor,
if
what
they
call
a
judgment
was
in
fact
not
a
judgment
but
even
assuming
it
is
a
judgment
i
would
not
really
want
this
court
to
--
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
yes
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
what
it
says.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
yes
sir
but
a
docket
entry
is
not
a
judgment
a
judgment
is
a
judgment,
a
judgment
is
a
finding
which
--
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
yes
you
do
but
you
put
it
in
as
a
judgment,
you
do
not
put
it
in
as
a
decision
if
it
was
--.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
would
say
it
is
a
decision
your
honor,
i
think
that
something.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
would
say
it
was
a
decision
whether
or
not.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
would
assume
your
honor
that
if
you
want
a
treat
a
final
decision
as
a
judgment,
if
you
want
to
find
or
treat.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
would
say
that
it
has
to
be
a
dismissal,
an
indictment
or
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
acquittal
entered
after
a
setting
aside
of
a
guilty
verdict.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
what
i
would
like
this
court
to
consider
is
the
interesting
problem
that
arises
and
i
suppose
it
comes
into
a
cross
rose
between
the
double
jeopardy
provisions,
the
statutory
provisions
for
how
a
suppression
motion
should
be
handled
and
other
constitutional
questions.
the
simple
answer
to
it
is
that
this
court
should
take
the
position
that
judge
gagliardi
was
under
an
obligation
to
decide
the
motion
for
suppression
before
he
decided
that
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
now,
the
practice
requires,
rule
requires
it
and
only
for
good
cause
shown
should
he
have
permitted
this
question
of
the
illegality
of
the
search
or
seizure
to
come
before
him
along
with
the
trial.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
say
first
he
should
have
decided
it
before
the
trial,
if
he
did
not
do
it
before
the
trial
despite
being
urged
to
do
so,
he
was
obligated
to
find
it
before
he
made
a
finding
of
guilty.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
do
not
find
any
holy
in
the
technique,
anything
holy
in
the
technical
right
of
the
government
to
appeal
where
the
government
itself
delays
unduly
giving
the
information
to
the
defendant,
so
he
can
comply
with
rule
12
so
he
can
make
in
a
normal
course
of
things,
a
suppression
motion.
i
think
that
if
the
government
does
this,
goes
to
this
delay
in
order
to
give
itself
a
technical
right
of
appeal
and
i
think
that
if
the
district
court
judge
goes
along
with
this
then
you
have
inequitable
conduct
which
should
in
my
judgment
stop
the
federal
government
from
exercising
its
technical
right
of
appeal
but
what
is
even
more
important
is
that
there
was
a
motion
made
to
dismiss
at
the
close
of
the
prosecutions
case.
at
that
point
judge
gagliardi
in
my
judgment,
was
under
an
obligation
to
determine
what
evidence
licitly
was
before
him,
if
he
was
going
to
determine
then
that
the
only
listed
the
evidence
before
him
was
insufficient
to
convict
the
defendant,
then
he
should
have
it
that
time
entered
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
at
that
time
jeopardy
would
have
attached,
at
that
time
the
government
would
have
no
right
of
appeal
by
merely
through
a
nicety
or
technicality
reserving
this
right,
reserving
it
until
after
he
has
heard
all
of
the
evidence,
reserving
until
he
has
weighed
illegal
evidence
in
determining
a
verdict
of
guilty,
then
determine
to
set
it
aside
simply
because.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
yes
but
that
was
unfortunately.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no
sir,
because
judge
gagliardi
himself
said.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
excuse
me,
no
your
honor.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
but
judge
gagliardi
--.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
am
sorry
excuse
me
your
honor.
your
honor
please
i
would
say
this
judge
gagliardi
said
he
would
have
permitted
the
same
illegal
testimony,
and
go
to
the
jury
and
then
if
the
jury
had
convicted
he
then
would
have
set
it
aside
simply
because
he
wanted
to
create
or
to
preserve
a
right
of
appeal
in
the
government,
a
right
of
appeal
that
the
government
could
have
and
should
have
exercised
pretrial,
if
it
had
done
the
right
thing,
the
equitable
thing,
the
fair
thing,
that
is
to
inform
this
defendant
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
an
illegal
search
and
seizure,
so
he
could
raise
it
before
trial
so
that
the
court
could
determine
it
before
trial,
so
that
the
defendant
would
not
be
put
in
a
position,
we
had
away
the
jury
trial
because
of
the
specter
of
having,
a
lot
of
prejudicial
evidence
come
before
a
jury,
before
he
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
in
to
witnesses,
before
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
determine
just
how
and
what
matter
he
should
properly
defend
his
client.
now,
i
don’t
believe
that
the
government
should
take
advantage
of
its
own
wrong
doing,
this
court
has
many
times
said
that
a
wrong
doer
should
not
profit
by
its
wrong
doing
and
this
case
it
is
the
government
who
was
the
wrong
doer
and
in
this
case
it
is
the
government
that
seeks
the
profit
by
its
wrong
doing
and
it
will
if
this
court
will
permit
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
ask
this
court
to
consider
another
issue
here,
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
other
side
of
attenuation.
in
other
words,
should
an
individual
who
finds
himself
in
a
position
of
knowing
that
the
government
has
illegally
obtained
evidence,
should
he
be
with
impunity
able
to
fly
in
the
face
of
that
that
evidence
and
commit
subsequent
crimes,
i
believe
not
and
i
do
not
intend
to
argue
that
point;
what
i
would
argue
is
simply
this
and
i
think
all
of
the
cases
that
have
been
considered
have
held
this.
that
where
a
defendant
has
no
knowledge
of
the
illegality
and
then
he
goes
before
a
grand
jury
and
then
the
prosecutor
does
not
tell
him
that
he
is
a
target
and
then
the
prosecutor
does
not
tell
him
that
he
has
any
kind
of
illegal
evidence
and
then
this
defendant
is
not
placed
in
the
same
position
as
the
individual
who
is
aware
of
the
fact
there
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure,
then
despite
that
such
as
in
the
income
tax
cases
files
a
fraudulent
return
or
in
the
other
fraud
cases
commits
a
fraudulent
act
relying
of
course,
erroneously,
on
the
fact
of
that
the
government
can
not
use
that
testimony
or
that
illegal
evidence
in
order
to
convict
him.
here
you
had
a
man
who
was
ingenuously
advised
by
the
united
states
attorney
against
all
the
rules
at
a
second
circuit
that
he
was
not
a
target
when
in
fact
he
was,
he
was
never
told
that
they
had
seen
mrs.
hennessey
and
had
this
illegal
evidence
when
in
fact
they
had
that
illegal
evidence.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
yes
your
honor,
they
could
have
solved
all
of
that
by
sealing
up
the
evidence.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
your
honor
he
could
have
solved
it
by
not
being
involved
in
anything.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
but
the
fact
is
he
was.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
or
by
telling
the
truth
but
the
fact
is
that
he
did
not
tell
the
truth
because
the
question
is
what
did
he
know
or
when
did
not
he
know
as
to
what
the
truth
was
or
what
the
evidence
was.
now,
i
am
not
trying
to
justify
or
excuse
purgery
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
due
process,
fair
play
inequity
in
our
court
procedures
and
if
the
united
states
attorney
who
is
not
only
the
prosecutor
but
the
protector
of
the
innocent,
does
not
the
follow
the
rules
then
who
will.
i
believe
that
the
government
is
here
to
protect
us
from
each
other
and
the
courts
are
here
and
should
be
here
to
protect
us
from
the
government
and
in
this
case
it
is
the
defendant
who
needs
protection
from
the
government
because
the
government
in
this
case
is
erred.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
he
did
not
follow
the
time
honored
rule
in
the
second
circuit
which
said
that
when
an
individual
is
called
before
a
grand
jury,
he
is
given
the
information
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
a
target.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
this
is
the
second
circuit
rule,
i
am
not
saying,
it
is
a
constitutional
rule
i
am
saying
that
is
the
rule
that
was
followed
and
has
been
time
honored
in
the
second
circuit.
i
know
this
court
has
had
a
difficult
time
in
its
decision
and
mandujano,
i
hope
i
am
pronouncing
it
correctly,
where
as
to
whether
or
not
these
questions
should
rise
to
constitutional
issues,
i
am
not
reaching
that
point,
i
am
merely
saying
that
as
far
as
the
rules
that
we
were
operating
under,
as
far
as
the
second
circuit
was
concerned
that
was
there
obligation,
the
second
circuit
recognizes
in
us
v.
jacobs
and
whatever
this
court
did
or
would
do
with
that
case,
i
am
not
arguing
as
the
law,
i
am
merely
arguing
that
if
there
is
a
procedure
it
should
be
followed
in
order
that
the
government
is
just
as
fair
as
it
can
possibly
can
be.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
believe
it
is
a
rule
of
the
united
states
attorney's
office
which
has
been
approved
by
the
second
circuit.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
because
i
do
not
think
it
was
even
argued.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no,
i
did
not
have
the
privilege
of
arguing
that
case.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
do
not
know
but
i
am
going
to
argue
it
and
if
this
court
will
accept
it
then
i
have
the
privilege.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no,
he
did
not
say
that
at
all.
what
he
did
say
is
that
when
you
take
away
lois
hennessey’s
testimony,
officer
biro’s
testimony
coupled
with
all
the
other
evidence
was
insufficient
to
convict
the
defendant.
the
other
point,
i
would
like
to
bring
out
to
the
court
is
that
there
was
a
wiretap
in
this
case
and
it
was
incorrectly
pointed
out
to
this
court
by
the
solicitor
general,
i
know
was
innocent
because
he
said
he
was
not
aware
of
that;
the
wiretap
was
one
that
was
conducted
by
the
westchester
county
district
attorney's
office
as
a
result
of
a
wiretap
order
by
the
honorable
isa
gruben
(ph)
who
is
the
administrative
judge
now
in
westchester
county
and
there
was
a
intercepted
conversation
between
millow
and
mr.
ceccolini
concerning
a
conversation
which
could
be
and
probably
would
be
interpreted
as
a
inculpatory.
however,
that
wiretap
was
not
brought
into
the
case
before
the
mr.
justice
gagliardi
or
before
the
second
circuit.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
he
mentioned
it
but
i
do
not
think
he
relied
on
that
sir.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
excuse
me,
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
he
did
not
know
about,
i
just
did
not
believe
it
was
relevant
in
the
issue.
now,
we
turn
to
a
question
of
double
jeopardy,
i
heard
the
solicitor
general
argue
quite
strenuously
for
the
fact
that
you
can
at
any
time
appeal
from
any
type
of
an
order
which
--
the
effect
of
which
will
be
if
you
win
the
appeal
merely
to
reinstate
a
guilty
verdict
and
he
says
that
even
if
the
court
would
make
further
findings
that
still
that
is
all
right
because
all
you
are
going
to
do
reinstate
a
guilty
verdict.
if
that
would
be
the
rule
that
this
court
sets,
i
would
disagree
with
it
wholeheartedly.
i
would
argue
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
adopt
a
rule
which
says
that
if
the
court
whether
it
is
this
court,
the
second
circuit
or
the
lower
court
whoever
is
given
the
task
of
making
further
findings
is
obligated
to
make
factual
determinations
of
any
kind
and
it
defends
the
rule
against
double
jeopardy
and
i
would
not
permit,
if
i
had
the
power
to
allow
the
court
to
make
further
findings,
i
believe
and
that
the
solicitor
general
is
accurate
when
he
says
that
if
all
the
court
has
to
do
without
making
any
further
findings
of
any
kind
is
to
reinstate
a
guilty
verdict
then
of
course
that
the
order
is
appealable
or
the
judgment
is
appealable
without
further
to
do
when
this
court
has
said
so
but
if
it
is
going
to
add
on
or
wander
away
from,
melt
away
the
question
of
do
you
or
should
you
make
further
findings
then
i
would
strenuously
argue
that
it
should
not
be
permitted,
no
further
findings
otherwise
its
double
jeopardy
i
believe
that
is
what
the
case
is
saying.
i
would
like
just
a
moment
to
address
something
which
i
do
not
believe
has
ever
then
fully
argued
before
this
court
if
it
has
been
argued
at
all
and
that
is
i
believe
this
court
should
adopt
the
doctrine
of
equitable
estoppel.
i
believe
that
the
foundation
of
every
exclusionary
rule,
the
foundation
of
every
rule
which
says
evidence
can
or
cannot
be
admitted
and
that
one
can
or
cannot
exercise
a
privilege
or
a
right
is
based
upon
the
doctrine
of
clean
hands
that
the
wrong
doer
should
not
profit
by
his
wrong
doing
that
one
should
not
walk
into
court
with
unclean
hands.
i
believe
this
court
in
harris
v.
new
york
which
was
argued
unsuccessfully
unfortunately
by
my
former
partner
and
it
is
a
matter
of
the
interest
argued
successfully
by
the
district
attorney
who
later
became
my
partner
is
simply
that
one
who
does
come
into
court
with
unclean
hands,
that
is
one
who
is
perjurer,
that
can
not
take
advantage
of
that
purgery
by
getting
on
the
stand
and
perjuring
himself
a
no,
that
you
can
use
illegal
evidence
to
impeach
him,
if
that
be
the
case
i
would
argue
more
strenuously
that
where
the
government
is
a
wrong
doer,
where
the
government
makes
a
mistake
where
the
government
does
something
to
create
something
which
it
really
has
no
right
to
then
under
that
set
of
circumstances
the
government
should
be
estopped,
the
government
has
been
estopped
in
civil
cases
involving
aliens
and
the
tax
cases
and
other
situations.
i
believe
it
to
be
the
foundation
of
all
of
your
doctrine
of
exclusionary
rules
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
adopt
it
in
this
case
to
prevent
or
estopp
the
government
from
exercising
any
technical
right
of
appeal
and
saying
that
from
this
moment
on
the
government
has
to
act
is
a
civilized
human
being
just
as
everyone
else.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
do
not
believe
so
your
honor
because
i
believe
what
that
would
be
then
is
that
she
went
there
before
the
agent
who
discovered
her
went
to
government
and
recorded
her,
i
think
then
he
would
have
truly
your
application
of
doctrine
of
intervening
superseding
clause.
but
otherwise
i
say
no,
it
is
a
close
question
i
do
not
say
that
it
is.
i
also
believe
it
to
be
a
factual
question
and
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
evidence
on
the
record
at
this
point
either
way.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no
sir.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
no
sir
i
would
not
even
to
try
to
argue
that,
only
for
what
the
fruit
of
this
illegal
search
would
produce
in
the
way
of
evidence,
i
do
not
say
he
could
not
be
prosecuted
only
that
what
they
discovered
could
not
be
used
against
him.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
after
the
fact
sir,
not
doing,
i
do
not
believe
she
was
studying
there
while
she
was
working
for
him,
she
went
to
study
that
after
she
left
this
employer.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
yes
sir,
could
have
been,
but
they
had
already
reported
it
when
the
government
knew
all
about
her
before
she
had
this
change
of
heart.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
what
sir,
the
fact
that
office
biro
reported
that
to
the
authorities?
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
that
is
all
sir,
that
then
i
know.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
yes
sir
because
i
think
you
are
under
the
silver
platter
doctrine,
the
left
hand
of
government
should
know
what
the
right
hand
is
doing
and
if
it
does
not,
i
do
not
think
the
defendant
should
suffer
because
of
it.
it
’is
not
an
easy
decision.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
i
am
not
saying
that
your
honor;
i
think
that
doctrine
has
been
rejected
by
courts
before
it
is
being
speculated.
i
do
not
think
you
can
determine
or
go
off
on
hypothetical
whether
they
would
have
or
they
should
have
or
could
have;
the
fact
is
that
they
did
not
in
this
case.
besides,
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
has
treated
from
the
inevitable
discovery
of
argument
and
it
does
not
urge
to
this
court.
of
course
this
court
is
not
bound
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
does
not
urge
it
but
as
a
matter
of
logic
i
just
don’t
think
it
should
be
in
this
specific
situation,
not
that
it
is
an
argument
that
could
not
be
raised
in
a
proper
case,
i
do
not
believe
this
is
the
proper
case.
mr.
leon
j.
greenspan
well,
i
think
the
question
of
forceability
the
famous
is
case
in
new
york
decided
many
years
ago
in
palsgraf
v.
long
island
railroads
sets
forth
the
question
forceability,
if
its
forceable
then
there
is
liability,
if
its
unforceable
then
there
is
not
liability.
i
know
its
an
over
simplification
but
i
think
you
have
to
make
an
analysis
as
to
whether
or
not
what
happened,
in
the
intervening
time
superseded
what
happened
before
hand
so
as
to
be
independent
and
i
do
not
think
that
is
what
happened
here,
i
am
not
saying
it
can
not
happen
or
that
you
can
not
get
a
set
of
facts
in
which
something
like
that
will
arise,
i
suppose
it
is
a
close
time
element
that
maybe
that
would
be
more
persuasive
but
we
do
not
have
this
type
of
analysis
in
this
case.
thank
you.
