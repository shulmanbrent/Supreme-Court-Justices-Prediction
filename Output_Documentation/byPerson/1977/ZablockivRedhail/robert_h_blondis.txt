mr.
robert
h.
blondis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
defendants
have
not
denied
that
marriage
involves
a
fundamental
right,
the
source
of
the
right
is
found,
not
in
state
law,
but
in
our
intrinsic
human
race.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
your
honor,
our
client
got
married
illinois
before
the
injunction
was
entered
by
the
court.
a
substantial
period
of
time,
the
lapse
between
the
time,
but
the
class
was
ordered
maintainable
as
a
class
action
as
to
the
plaintiffs.
till
then
oral
argument
was
held
and
then
lastly
the
opinion
was
rendered
and
the
order
for
judgment
--
and
judgment
were
rendered.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
at
that
we
could
not
get
a
hold
of
our
client,
your
honor.
we
were
not
aware
that
he
got
married
in
illinois.
the
illinois
marriage
is
invalid
and
he
is
still
affected
by
section
245.10.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes,
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
we
had
not
at
that
time,
he
got
married
after
all
the
pleadings,
after
the
case
had
been
completely
submitted
to
the
court.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
well,
mr.
redhail
was
a
resident
of
wisconsin
when
he
went
in
seeking.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
the
constitutionality
of
that
provision
[laughter]
maybe
questionable
your
honor.
it
had
not
when
mr.
redhail
came
into
our
office,
he
was
not
being
affected
by
that
statute.
he
kind
of
cared
less
about
the
statute.
he
wanted
to
get
married.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes,
he
is.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
did
he
ever?
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
no,
your
honor.
he
and
his
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
he
and
his
intended
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
your
honor,
he
never
was
in
fact
married.
his
marriage
was
invalid.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
the
federal
judge?
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
in
light
of
the
fact
your
honor
that
his
marital
status
was
the
same
as
if
he
had
never
got
married
in
wisconsin
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
he
got
married
in
illinois
because
he
was
having
a
second
child
by
his
intended
spouse,
had
been
refused
permission
by
the
state
to
receive
permission
to
marry,
sought
desperately
to
get
married
and
i
have
not
discussed
with
him
his
exact
reason
for
getting
married,
but
it
could
have
been
that
he
just
simply
got
impatient.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
went
into
illinois
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
your
honor,
we
were
not
aware
that
he
had
gotten
married
until
after
the
opinion
and
injunction.
in
other
words
we
lost
touch
with
mr.
redhail.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
your
honor,
no
we
did
not.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
to
mr.
redhail,
it
did.
we
have
since
explained
the
legal
predicament
that
he
has
put
himself
in.
for
whatever
reason
the
solemnization
of
his
relationship
which
in
fact
is
void
under
the
eyes
of
wisconsin
law.
did
mean
something
to
him
and
his
spouse.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
because
wisconsin--
under
the,
under
the--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
i
believe
that
under
wisconsin
law,
wisconsin
law,
even
in
the
age
requirement
is
that
if
one
leaves
the
state
for
the
purpose
of
intentionally
awaiting
its
state's
marriage
laws,
then
returns
to
the
state
and
retains
residency.
that
law
or
that
marriage
is
invalid
and
would
have
to
be
validated.
in
mr.
redhail's
case,
mr.
redhail
would
have
to
go
through
an
annulment
proceedings.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes.
from
what
i
understand.[laughter]
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
your
honor,
i
am
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
no.
i
am
trying
to
have
a
loss
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
your
honor,
i
did
not
make
the
marriage
invalid.
the
statute
in
question,
section
245.10.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
well,
i
am
trying
to
persuade
the
court
that
the
statute
is
invalid
and
that
mr.
redhail
has
been
victimized
by
the
statute.
not
only
has
he
been
victimized
by
the
statute,
but
his
indented
spouse
has
been
victimized
by
the
statute
and
his
second
child
has
been
victimized
by
the
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
oh,
yes
it
will
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
if
he
--
if
this
statute,
if
this
court
affirms
the
lower
court,
mr.
redhail
would
then
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
no.
he
would
then
have
to
undergo
a
state
court
proceeding
which
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
the
illinois
marriage
complicates
things
because
in
--
i
do
not
believe
it
complicates
things
for
purposes
of
this
case.
it
complicates
things
for
mr.
redhail
because
he
would
have
to
your
honor,
under
wisconsin
law,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
void
marriage.
that
is
in
order
for
a
marriage
to
be
clear
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
but,
even
then
he
would
have
to
go
through
a
court
procedure
so
that
a
judge
says
that
it
is
void.
in
other
words,
it
maybe
void
in
fact,
but
a
court
has
to
announce
that
it
is
void.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
oh,
i
see
your
point.
yes,
i
think
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
that
is
right,
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
that
is
correct,
as
long
as
245
is
on
books,
in
wisconsin,
then
mr.
redhail's
marriage
is
as
if
he
never
got
married.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
the
extra-territorial
affect
of
it.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
afterwards
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes,
class.
yes,
that
is
right
and
after,
well
after
all
argument
had
taken
place.
your
honor,
the
state
in
its
brief
proposed
to
this
court
that
because
that
this
is
a
statute
dealing
with
marriage
and
divorce,
the
state
has
peculiar
interest
in
that
area
and
therefore
this
court
should
supply
a
rational
relationship,
equal
protection
or
i
suppose,
substantive
due
process
analysis
to
this
case.
the
state
in
my
opinion
gave
no
good
reason
why
that
should
be
the
case,
we
are
aware
of
cases
both
in
marriage
and
divorce
and
in
voting
and
probate
where
this
court
has
held
that
states
have
a
peculiar
interest
in
those
areas,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
the
court
has
ever
gone
so
far
as
to
hold
that
regulations
which
adversely
effect
serious
long
standing
fundamental,
constitutional
rights
are
going
to
be
completely
deferred
to
by
the
state
by
the
application
of
the
rational
relationship
equal
protection
test.
concerning
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
the
state
argued
in
the
lower
court
that
the
purposes
of
the
statute
was
the
provision
of
counseling
to
persons
who
are
about
to
go
--
undergo
marriage.
i
bring
that
up,
only
because
the
only
legislative
history
available
in
behind
the
statute
which
is
cited
at
pages
29
through
32
of
our
brief
indicates
that,
that
in
fact
was
the
benevolent
purpose
of
the
statute.
it
was
to
provide
counseling
for
persons
who
had
support
obligations
and
were
about
to
undergo
marriage.
this
statute
obviously
has
nothing
to
do
with
counseling.
counseling
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
confines
of
the
statute.
courts
are
not
encouraged
or
mandated
to
give
counseling,
nor
are
applicants
to
the
courts
encouraged
to
get
it.
so,
if
counseling
is
still
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
it
is
completely
irrational.
the
reason
most
seriously
forward
by
the
state,
presently
in
this
appeal
is
that
this
statute
protects
the
interests
that
mr.
redhail's
child
has
to
support.
we
do
not
believe
that
either
is
the
intent
of
the
statute
mr.
redhail's
child
has
been
supported
by
under
the
afdc
program
almost
since
her
birth
that
is
if
the
first
child.
the
debt
that
mr.
redhail
owes
is
not
to
that
child,
the
debt
that
he
owes
is
to
the
state
of
wisconsin.
what
wisconsin
is
saying
in
affect
to
mr.
redhail
is
that
until
you
pay
us
you
can
not
get
married
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
i
am
not,
no
your
honor,
i
am
not
saying
that
at
all.
mr.
redhail
went
to
paternity
court
in
1972.
he
admitted
paternity
in
that
action
and
the
court
ordered
that
he
pay
support
of
$109
per
month.
that
although
as
the
state
agreed
he
was
a
minor
and
a
high
school
student,
well
in
any
event
the
afdc
which
he
received
--
which
his
child
is
receiving
is
substantially
above
$109
per
month,
that
he
was
ordered
to
pay.
therefore
what
i
am
saying
is
that
even
if
mr.
redhail
tomorrow
came
into
the
clerk
of
court
with
all
of
his
arrearages
under
that
$109
support
order
and
paid
every
cent
of
that
even
pay
the
$109
sometime
into
the
future.
he
still
could
not
get
married
because
his
child
would
still
be
count
–
would
still
remain
a
public
charge.
so,
how
the
state
can
justify
the
statute
by
saying
that--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
i
understand
that
your
honor
but
what
am
i
saying
is
that
what
i
just
said
indicates
that
it
really
does
not
have
much
to
do
with
its
intended
purpose.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
no
not
at
all
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
it
would
not
do
mr.
redhail
any
good,
it
would
do
the
child
a
lot
of
good.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
certainly.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
but
what
am
i
saying
is
that
statute
is
not
--
this
particular
statute
is
not
related
to
child
support.
if
the
state
is
serious
about
collecting
child
support
from
mr.
redhail
the
state
has
many
methods
available
to
it
which
are
very
effective.
the
state
can
take
mr.
redhail
back
in
that
paternity
court
which
originally
set
the
$109
per
month
support
and
that
state
can
say
mr.
redhail
you
tell
the
court
why
you
have
not
paid
the
$109.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
state
has
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes,
but
the
reason
i
make
that
point,
the
point
that
there
is
legislation
which,
there
is
other
legislation
available
to
it.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
is
that
is
--
it
is
my
understanding
under
the
either
the
substantive
due
process
or
the
equal
protection
strict
scrutiny
analysis,
that
the
last
prong
of
that
analysis,
is
that
there
must
be
a
showing
not
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
and
that
the
legislation
is
tied
to
that
interest.
but
that
there
is
no
last
intrusive
method
available
for
the
state
to
accomplish
its
legitimate
goal.
in
accomplishing
presuming
that
this
accomplishes
the
state
goal
in
coercing
somehow
mr.
redhail
to
pay
support.
it
also
takes
away
his
fiancee's
right
to
marry,
it
absolutely
prohibits
her
from
marrying.
mr.
redhail's
case
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
marrying
him
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
but
she
was
adamant
that
she
wanted
to
marry
him.[laughter]
it
also
has
has
the
effect
on
mr.
redhail's
case
of
stigmatizing
his
second
child
as
an
illegitimate
child.
so
the
statute
not
only
affects
mr.
redhail,
it
also
affects
many
other
person.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
no
your
honor,
i
think
this
statute
is
unique
to
wisconsin
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
in
the
offer
decision
that
this
court
decided
last
term
the
court
again
reiterated
that
the
right
to
marry
is
a
fundamental
right
and
stated
that
the
right
again
is
not
a
source
of
state
law,
but
is
basic
human
right.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
i
am
getting
to
that
your
honor.
the
court
held
that
the
right
to
marry
is
contoured
in
our
society
and
in
our
traditions
and
i
think
that
no
one
would
argue
that
the
tradition
of
marriage
as
this
society
knows
it,
would
prohibit
a
person
either
from
having
two
wives
at
one
time
or
two
husbands
at
one
time
for
that
matter
or
marrying
his
sister.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
statute
reflects
the
history
and
traditions
of
the
fundamental
right
to
marry
and
this
compelling
a
person
or
prohibiting
a
person
from
marrying
because
his
children
are
receiving
public
assistance.
i
do
not
believe
is
a
part
of
that
fundamental
or
of
that
tradition
as
we
know
the
right
to
marry
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
no,
your
honor
all
i
am
saying
as
far
as
the
language
in
the
offer
opinion
is
language
of
this
court
and
language
noting
--
that
the
court,
that
the
right
to
marriage
is
in
fact
older
that
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
well
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
–-
presuming
that
there
was
legislation
which
seriously
prohibited
the
right
to
marry
and
let
us
say
that,
that
legislation
was
an
age
limitation.
i
believe
that,
that
type
of
limitation
would
be
justifiable
both
because
the
state
could
show
a
very
strong
interest
in
it
and
because
it
has
traditionally
been
a
part
of
state's
role
to
define
an
age
limit
before
which
one
can
marry.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
well
i
do
not
--
i
think
--
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
semantics,
i
think
that
which
either
side
is
trying
to
justify
it,
there
are
some
prohibitions
and
marriage
that
can
certainly
be
justified
and
i
that
there
are
others
that
can
not.
the
point
that
i
would
stress
is
that
court
does
not
have
to
decide
in
this
case
every
justification
or
non-justification
for
concerning
the
interference
on
the
right
to
marry.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
i
believe
your
honor
that
the
court
in
these
kinds
of
cases
has
considered
each,
each
prohibition
or
interval
has
weighed
each
marriage,
divorce
law
that
it
has
been
dealing
with
and
its
own
individual
merits
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
alright.
we
start
from
the
analysis
that
marriage
is
fundamental
right.
a
fundamental
right,
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
and
that
i
think
that
court
has
reiterated
that
in
numerous
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
no.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
i
am
not
sure,
but
it
very
well
may
be
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
but
your
honor
this
statute
does
not
even
have
that
kind
of
a
justification.
in
order
to
justify
,
in
order
to
justify
this
statute
on
those
ground
one
would
assume,
one
would
have
to
assume
that
by
entering
into
a
marriage
a
person
is
becoming
less
able
to
support
a
prior
child.
with
a
number
of
childless
new
marriages
today
and
the
number
of
households
in
which
both
spouses
work
there
is
entirely
possible
that
by
entering
into
a
marriage
one
could
actually
improve
ones
ability
to
support
a
child
from
a
former
marriage
or
a
child
who
was
born
out
of
marriage.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
your
honor
in
our
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
well,
your
honor
the
class
was
defined
to
cover
everyone
who
was
affected
by
the
statute
and
the
class
was
not
defined
on
the
basis
of
indigence
versus
non-indigence.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
it
has
no
--
it
has
never
objected
to
the
definition
of
the
class.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
in
this
case
it
would
be
exactly
the
opposite.
but
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes,
and
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes,
there
is
a
stipulation
of
fact
in
the
record
that,
during
all
times
that
are
relevant
to
the
litigation
mr.
redhail
was
indigent
was
unemployed
and
for
a
good
deal
of
that
time
was
a
high
school
student.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
your
honor
i
believe
that
the
appellant's
summary
of
the
new
statute
is
fairly
accurate.
if
mr.
--
in
addition
to
making
some
exceptions
that
are
not
found
in
the
present
statute.
mr.
redhail
would
not
be
covered
at
all
by
the
new
statute,
because
it
only
covers
support
obligations
which
were
entered
into
as
a
result
of
a
marriage.
it
does
not
cover
out
of
wedlock
children
and
i
would
hope
that
it
might
indicate
suspicion
on
the
part
of
the
state
legislature
as
to
some
of
the
problems
with
the
wisconsin
statute
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
unless
--
unless
another
court
--
the
legislation
does
not
specifically
refer
to
this
case.
the
legislation
says
that
the
new
section
will
go
into
affect
if
any
court
stays
or
enjoins
245.10
which
is
the
present
statute.
we
made
after
submitting
the
supplemental
memorandum
to
this
court
made
as
much
of
an
investigation
as
we
could
and
to
our
knowledge
there
is
no
litigation
either
pending
or
already
decided,
which
would
have
that
effect.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
most
certainly.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
it
wont
be
--
my
understanding
is
that
will
not
be
veto,
yes
there
is
an
over
right
provision.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
seen
this
wisconsin
your
honor.
i
understand
that
has
happed
in
some
other
states.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
redhail
could
--
mr.
redhail
i
would
like
to
emphasize
again
under
this
statute
for
all
intends
can
never
get
married
unless
the
custodian
of
his
first
child
gets
off
of
welfare
and
that
is
completely
beyond
his
control.
so
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes
because
then
the
child
would
no
longer
receive
welfare,
but
again
the
child
becoming
a
multimillionaire
is
probably
beyond
his
control.
just
a
few
comments
concerning
the
abstention
argument.
the
defendants
did
not
even
seriously
forward
the
abstention
argument
in
the
lower
court
and
this
court
has
noted
in
a
number
of
opinions
that
it
will
take
that
into
consideration
in
determining
whether
abstention
applies.
it
is
our
opinion
that
abstention
does
not
apply
in
any
of
its
forms,
the
defendants
argued
that
the
pullman
doctrine
applies
because
the
statute
is
constitutionally
unclear,
but
it
is
our
understanding
of
the
pullman
doctrine,
that
it
only
applies
when
the
statue
itself
is
unclear.
concerning
notice
to
the
class
of
defendants
the
trial
court
noted
in
its
opinion
that
there
was
as
much
unity
of
interest
among
those
defendants
as
possibly
there
could
have
been.
every
defendant
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
pardon
me.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
because
mr.
redhail
could
not
have
received
permission
in
any
county
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
because
each
defendant
in
the
state,
each
defendant
which
is
every
county
clerk
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
exactly
the
same
obligations
on
statute
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
i
would
hope
so
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
that
is
correct
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
at
the
time
that
the
action
was
brought
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
the
real
answer
is
that,
if
the
action
is
a
class
action
as
to
state
wide
class
of
plaintiffs.
all
of
those
plaintiffs
are
not
going
to
be
applying
to
the
milwaukee
county
court
clerk
mr.
zablocki.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
pardon
me.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
every
member
of
the
plaintiff
class.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
i
would
--
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
in
any
event
i
would
hope
that
were
this
court
should
affirm
the
other
members
of
the
class
of
the
defendant
class
would
abide
by
the
court's
decision.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
your
honor
in
my
law
school
we
did
not
study
class
actions.
mr.
robert
h.
blondis
there
is
some
problem
in
that
litigation
with
non-class
action
and
enforcement
of
federal
court
orders.
thank
you.
