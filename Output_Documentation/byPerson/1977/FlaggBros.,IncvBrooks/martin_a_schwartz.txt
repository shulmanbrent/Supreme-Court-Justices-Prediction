mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
commence
my
argument
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
mootness.
mrs.
jones
claims
that
the
$16,00.00
payment
she
made
during
the
course
of
the
litigation
was
not
made
voluntarily,
but
at
least
in
part
because
of
the
threat
of
sale.
she
would
have
a
claim
for
damages
at
least
for
a
part
of
that
$16,00.00
payment.
in
addition,
i
closely
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
defendants
charged
mrs.
jones
an
auctioneerâs
fee
presumably
for
a
schedule
to
sale
and
under
the
code,
in
order
for
a
person
whose
goods
are
stored
to
exercise
a
right
of
redemption,
part
of
the
cost
which
must
be
paid
are
the
fees
involved
in
the
carrying
out
of
the
contemplated
or
actual
sale.
i
think
this
claim
for
damages
is
efficient
to
keep
the
case
alive.
i
would
also
point
out
that
in
all
of
these
consumer
due
process
cases
which
have
been
brought
the
last
few
years,
there
is
virtually
an
inherent
problem
in
mootness.
we
pointed
this
out
to
the
circuit
court.
we
prepared
in
appendix
in
the
circuit
court
which
listed
the
various
cases
and
the
status
of
the
good
during
the
litigation
and
it
is
inevitable
that
a
threat
of
sale
will
not
continue
during
an
entire
lengthy
litigation
period.
we
brought
this
case
at
the
time
the
threat
of
sale
existed.
we
submit
that
was
as
proper
time
to
bring
the
case
to
try
to
stop
the
sale.
the
lawsuit
served
that
purpose,
but
it
is
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
that
threat
will
continue
during
the
course
of
a
three
or
four-year
litigation
period.
i
would
say
that
the
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review
doctrine
would
also
apply
to
these
type
of
situation
and
i
would
also
point
that
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
but
she
claims
that
one
reason
for
that
$16,00.00
payment
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
but
she
claims
it
was
not
a
voluntary
payment.
this
woman
was
left
without
all
her
possessions
for
virtually
a
two-year
period
your
honor
and
of
course
the
payment
of
the
auctioneeras
fee
would
only
have
to
be
made
because
the
statute
was
invoked
against
her.
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
we
have
filed
an
action
on
behalf
of
a
client
whose
goods
have
been
sold
already
in
the
southern
district
and
it
is
assigned
to
the
same
judge
before
whom
the
brooksa
case
was
assigned
and
the
only
reason
that
we
could
not
move
to
intervene
at
that
point
into
the
brookas
action
is
because
the
circuit
court
stayed
its
own
mandate
remanding
the
action
to
the
district
court
pending
proceedings
in
this
court.
so,
there
is
another
case
which
has
been
filed.
it
was
just
a
mere
formality.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
parties
did
stipulate
to
the
propriety
of
the
class
here.
there
was
no
certification.
the
district
court
never
so
ordered
the
stipulation.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
at
the
time
the
stipulation
was
entered
into,
your
honor,
the
attorney
general
and
the
associations
were
not
parties
to
the
lawsuit.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
now,
they
are
but
a
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
would
also
point
that
the
action
clearly
meets
all
of
the
requirements
of
rule
23
(a)
and
(b)
2.
it
is
clearly
the
type
of
action
that
subdivision
(b)
2
was
intended
to
apply
to
it.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
understand
that
your
honor.
i
am
just
saying
that
it
is
another
factor
to
consider
if
the
case
was
remanded
back
to
the
district
court
as
the
circuit
court
contemplated.
the
circuit
court
opinion
i
believe,
contemplates
that
the
action
is
a
proper
class
action,
but
that
the
only
question
is
the
propriety
of
the
scope.
we
did
everything
possible
to
get
this
class
certified.
we
entered
into
a
stipulation,
went
to
over
side
or
whatever
the
stipulation
was
not
approved.
we
moved
for
class
certification.
the
district
judge
did
not
pass
on
the
certification.
we
appealed.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
we
moved
for
a
class
certification
and
summary
judgment
at
the
same
time
your
honor.
we
then
appealed
from
the
denial
of
the
class
certification
as
well
as
they
say,
the
only
reason
there
is
any
mootness
problem
here
at
all
is
because
the
certificate
court
stayed
its
own
mandate
otherwise
this
new
client,
mrs.
fence
would
have
intervened
into
the
brookâs
action,
but
we
do
have
an
action
filed
on
behalf
of
somebody
who
is
good
to
solve.
your
honors,
the
point
of
contention
is
that
state
action
is
present
in
this
case
because
we
have
a
direct,
precise
and
significant
nexus
between
the
stay
and
the
contested
activity.
the
state
has
delegated
two
warehousemen.
the
extraordinary
power
to
summarily
sell
bailoras
goods
and
in
doing
so,
we
contend
that
new
york
has
delegated
to
warehouseman,
the
public
functions
of
reinforcement
and
non-consensual
dispute
resolution.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
there
would
be
no
power
of
sale
your
honor
and
despite
what
my
adversary
said,
the
authorities
are
in
consistent
agreement
and
we
cited
them
in
the
brief,
there
was
no
power
of
sale
at
common
law.
it
is
clear;
i
do
not
know
how
my
adversary
can
make
the
statement
to
the
contrary.
baileeas
right
to
common
law
was
merely
the
right
to
became
possession
of
the
goods.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
he
could
go
to
the
court.
the
normal
common
law
if
the
bailee
sought
to
enforce
his
lien,
his
remedy
was
to
bring
in
action
in
court
and
if
he
proved
his
claim
and
defeated
offenses
and
obtained
the
judgment,
the
sheriff
would
then
levy
execution
on
the
very
goods
that
was
sold.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
would
say
that
this
is
a
direct
substitute
for
that
process.
that
is
a
judicial
process,
judicial
determination
and
judicial
enforcement
and
our
position
is
that
a
person
whose
goods
are
sold
under
this
statute,
under
section
7-210
stands
in
the
precise
posture
of
a
defendant
and
a
judicial
action
against
whom
a
judgment
has
been
gotten
and
enforced
with
one
exception
and
that
exception
is
that
the
person
whose
goods
are
sold
under
section
7-210
does
not
get
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
sale,
whereas
the
person
whose
goods
are
sold
after
a
judicial
proceeding
presumably
does.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
our
primarily
claim
your
honor
is
that
the
enactment
of
the
statute
constitutes
the
delegation
of
power
which
is
normally
associated
with
sovereignty.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
my
position
would
have
to
be
the
same.
if
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
recognize
that
the
extensively
private
sector
has
the
power
to
exercise
functions
which
are
governmental
in
nature,
we
would
nevertheless
have
a
delegation
from
the
public
sector
to
the
private
sector
of
governmental
power.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
it
is
the
delegation
of
sovereign
power
by
any
branch
of
the
government.
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
it
is
more
than
a
defense
your
honor
because
these
goods
are
sold
without
a
hearing.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
a
conversion
action
come
about
because
of
an
unlawful
sale
and
what
this
statute
does
is
make
this
sale
lawful.
it
makes
what
would
have
been
an
unlawful
act
a
lawful
act.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
but
it
gives
them
more
than
a
defense.
it
gives
them
much
more
than
a
defense.
it
gives
them
a
defense
if
an
action
in
conversion
is
brought.
but
if
an
action
in
conversion
is
not
brought,
it
gives
them
the
power
to
resolve
this
dispute
by
selling
a
personâs
goods
summarily.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
that
is
true
but
if
a
case
was
brought
it
would
be
an
unlawful
act.
the
state
here
is
making
lawful
what
would
otherwise
be
clearly
unlawful
in
common
law,
there
is
no
question
of
that.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
we
do
not
rely
on
that
alone.
the
heart
of
our
claim
is
this.
that
this
person
whose
goods
are
sold
stands
in
the
same
position
as
a
defendant
in
a
judicial
proceeding
against
whom
a
judgment
was
taken
and
against
whom
that
judgment
was
enforced
by
this
power
of
sale
of
his
goods
and
we
would
say
what
is
involved
here
are
the
combination
functions
of
non-consensual
dispute
resolution
which
is
normally,
historically,
and
traditionally
carried
out
by
the
courts
together
with
lien
reinforcement
which
is
the
enforcing
mechanism
which
is
normally
carried
out
by
sheriffs
and
constables.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
would
have
to
consistently
your
honor
because
the
common
law
would
then
be
recognizing
that
the
private
sector
has
what
we
claim
to
be
a
power
of
the
sovereign.
i
cannot
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
immaterial.
perhaps
the
circuit
court
stated
the
proposition
to
broadly
when
they
spoke
about
the
statutory
reversal
of
the
common
law
in
a
vacuum.
i
think
the
statutory
reversal
of
the
common
law
is
relevant
into
somewhat
limited
respects.
first
of
all,
how
the
function
was
carried
out
at
common
law
tends
to
give
us
some
evidence
as
to
whether
that
function
was
in
the
private
and
public
sector.
for
example
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
that
the
private
sector
did
not
have
the
power
to
determine
these
disputes
and
to
enforce
liens.
so
with
some
evidence
that
the
power
was
not
lodged
in
the
private
sector
at
common
law
and
on
the
contrary
in
response
to
mr.
justice
whiteâs
question,
i
stated
that
that
what
happened
at
common
law
was
that
the
lien
would
in
fact
be
enforced
after
a
judicial
proceeding
and
enforcement
by
the
sheriff
so
that
at
common
law
this
is
a
function
which
is
historically
and
traditionally
was
carried
out
by
courts
and
sheriffs
and
constables.
in
addition,
i
think
the
lack
of
common
law
authority
is
significant
in
that
it
shows
that
when
the
warehouseman
does
exercises
his
power,
he
is
acting
under
and
only
under
this
particular
statute,
he
must
be
acting
in
reliance
upon
the
statute.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
your
question
presupposes
a
valid
contract?
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
all
right.
if
we
had
a
valid
contractual
power
of
sale,
i
would
say
that
this
would
be
a
prime
example
of
a
credit
as
remedy
which
came
about
as
a
result
of
a
contractual
voluntarily
agreement.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
now,
you
are
assuming
the
existence
of
the
statute?
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
then
there
would
be
state
action
because
the
only,
let
me
make
sure
i
have
this
question
straight.
we
have
the
statutory
power
of
sale.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
if
it
is
totally
contractual,
i
would
say
that
the
state
is
not
involved.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
but
if
we
have
a
valid
contract
with
a
power
of
sale
in
that
contract.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
we
may
have
reference
to
state
law,
but
the
power
of
sale
came
about
because
the
parties
mutually,
consensually
agreed
that
upon
default
the
warehouseman
would
have
the
power
of
sale,
that
is
not
what
we
have
in
this
case.
in
this
case
we
have
a
power
of
sale
which
exists
only
by
operation
of
the
statute.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
we
do
not
contest
the
lien.
the
constitutionality
of
the
lien
we
are
not
contesting.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
the
lien
at
common
law
is
defined
as
the
right
to
detain
the
goods
indefinitely
until
the
bailor
makes
all
the
payments
which
the
bailee
claims
are
due
and
owing.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
and
that
is
all.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
he
can
go
to
court,
but
any
other
creditor
can
go
court
too.
the
norm
for
is
for
a
creditor
who
claims
he
has
an
amount
due
and
owing
to
bring
a
judicial
proceeding,
prove
his
claim,
if
he
can
defeat
defenses,
obtain
a
judgment
and
seek
to
enforce
that
judgment.
this
statute
in
effect
short
circuits
that
entire
process.
if
i
could
get
back
to
mr.
justice
whites
question,
the
difference
between
a
contractual
power
of
sale
and
the
statutory
power
of
sale
is
the
difference
between
voluntary
dispute
resolution
which
is
historically
and
traditionally
been
in
the
private
sector
and
involuntary,
non
consensual
dispute
resolution
which
has
historically
and
traditionally
been
the
function
of
the
courts
and
the
sheriffs.
well,
i
see
that
it
is
12
o'clock
if
i
might
complete
my
argument
after.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
thank
you.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
jackson
versus
metropolitan
edison
company,
this
court
stated
that
the
characterization
which
the
state
courts
give
to
a
function
as
to
whether
that
function
is
public
or
private
in
nature
is
entitled
to
wait
in
making
the
determination
whether
the
state
has
delegated
a
public
function
to
the
ostensibly
private
sector.
the
rationale
for
this,
we
respectfully
submit
is
that
just
as
the
state
courts
have
the
expertise
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
the
granting
of
the
license
itself
of
course
would
be
a
public
function,
but
the
activity
is
carried
out
under
that
license,
might
be
public,
might
be
private,
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
powers
that
were
delegated.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
the
general
everyday
activities
of
warehouse
companies,
i
would
concede
are
functions
which
are
private
in
nature.
they
are
genuinely
contractual
relationships,
contracts
of
moving
and
storage.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
stateâs
delegation
of
the
power
of
summary
sale
is
of
that
type
of
nature
whether
it
is
private
in
nature
or
whether
this
is
the
type
of
function
which
is
historically
and
traditionally
has
been
associated
with
sovereignty
whether
it
is
a
public
function
and
my
point
is
that
the
characterization
given
by
a
state
court
as
to
whether
that
function
is
public
or
private
in
nature
should
be
given
some
weight
by
this
court
in
making
that
determination
and
the
rationale
for
that
is
that
the
state
courts
just
as
they
have
the
expertise
on
questions
of
state
law
or
in
a
particularly
good
position
particularly
the
highest
court
in
the
state
to
evaluate
whether
a
function
is
public
or
private
in
the
particular
state.
in
this
case,
in
new
york,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
blye
v.
globe-wernicke
company
has
concluded
that
in
new
york
lien
enforcement
historically
and
traditionally
has
been
the
function
of
the
sheriff.
now,
the
attorney
general
seeks
to
distinguish
the
blye
case
as
a
case
involving
a
seizure
of
goods
under
the
inn
keeperâs
lien
law.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
in
blye
did
not
hold
that
it
is
a
seizure
which
constitutes
a
public
function,
but
rather
held
that
it
is
the
execution
of
a
lien,
regardless
of
the
method
of
lien
enforcement
which
in
new
york
has
been
the
function
of
the
sheriff
and
in
fact
cited
two
types
of
liens.
judgment
liens
and
liens
which
arise
from
an
action
to
judicially
foreclosing
mortgage
which
are
liens
which
can
be
enforced
by
sale
and
without
seizure.
in
addition,
the
appellate
division
in
new
york
has
concluded
that
lien
enforcement
where
accomplished
by
sale
and
without
seizure
is
also
a
function
which
historically
and
traditionally
has
been
the
function
of
the
sheriff
in
new
york.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
it
is
not
an
act
by
a
state
official.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
we
would
not
say
the
state
is
liable.
we
would
say
that
the
state
would
be
liable
in
evans
v.
newton,
and
in
the
case
where
the
function
of
running
a
park
has
been
delegated.
it
is
public
under
the
state
action
doctrine.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
state
has
liability
for
the
acts
of
the
defendant.
that
would
be
true
in
all
the
public
function
cases
which
this
court
has
decided.
i
would
also
stress
that
the
decisions
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
our
point
is
that
this
defendant
is
bound
to
comply
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
that
is
right.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
that
is
right,
but
that
does
not
make
the
state
qua
state
liable
which
i
took
to
be
mr.
justice
whiteâs
question.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
the
sheriff
would
be
liable
with
the
one
exception
that
he
would
have
a
good
faith
immunity
from
liability
for
damages.
he
is
subject
to
liability
in
the
first
section
1983
(voice
overlap).
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well
that
raises
a
question
which
i
(voice
overlap)
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
we
contend
that
it
is
state
action
whether
damages
would
flow
from
the
private
party's
wrong
and
this
situation
whether
this
(voice
overlap)
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
we
can
get
into
the
court
on
1983
action.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
injunctive
relief,
declaratory
relief,
and
damages
with
the
possible
exception
that
whether
or
not
this
dependent
would
have
a
good
faith
immunity
is
i
believe
a
question
which
this
court
has
not
answered.
otherwise
whether
this
type
of
defendant
would
have
the
same
immunity
as
a
sheriff
or
other
executive
or
administrative
official
are
only
qualified
in
that
respect.
the
decisions
of
the
new
york
court
(voice
overlap)
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
we
contend
that
that
makes
this
statute
worse
than
the
statutes
which
were
involved
in
the
sniadach
fuentes
and
di-chem
cases.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
absolutely
not,
your
honor
because
they
come
about
as
a
result
of
a
contractual
agreement.
we
sharply
distinguish
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
it
is
a
substitute
your
honor
when
it
is
exercised
as
a
result
of
non-consensual
dispute
resolution.
when
it
is
a
substitute
for
the
functions
exercised
by
the
courts
and
sheriff,
it
is
not
a
substitute
when
it
comes
about
as
a
result
of
a
voluntary
neutral
agreement
between
the
parties
that
historically
and
traditionally
has
been
in
the
private
sector.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
sure.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
the
failure
to
give
the
notice
might
constitute
not
only
a
state
law,
but
if
there
is
state
action
in
this
case
as
we
contend
then
it
would
also
constitute
a
violation
of
the
due
process
for
us
because
our
substantive
claim
is
that
an
owner
of
the
goods
should
be
given
adequate
notice
and
some
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
sale.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
your
honor,
he
might
be
acting
in
violation
of
state
law.
well,
it
means
in
threatening
to
sale
or
in
engaging
in
the
sale
itself,
he
would
necessarily
be
invoking
the
power
of
the
statute,
otherwise
he
could
not
sell.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
we
are
only
arguing
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation,
a
violation
of
due
process
which
i
take
it
to
be
the
lack.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
that
is
right
of
course.
our
basic
claim
is
that
due
process
requires
some
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
sale,
the
statute
does
not
provide
for
any
opportunity.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
cannot
see
the
distinction
your
honor
because
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
but
in
exercising
the
power
of
sale,
he
is
invoking
the
statutory
power.
he
may
have
engaged
in
some
procedural
irregularity
along
the
way,
but
when
he
makes
that
determination
to
sell,
and
he
in
fact
sells,
he
is
only
acting
on
the
color
of
that
statute.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
that
is
right,
but
not
because
it
was
fraudulent.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
because
due
process
violation.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
that
is
right
and
whether
he
conducted
a
fraudulent
sale
or
did
not
comply
with
the
procedural
requirements,
those
are
all
of
course
generally
questions
of
the
the
state
law.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
that
is
right.
i
might
also
say
that
those
normally
questions
which
would
be
determined
at
a
hearing
prior
to
the
sale,
in
other
words
whether
the
warehouseman
has
a
proper
lien,
the
amount
of
the
charges,
the
extent
of
the
lien
or
whether
the
proper
notification
provisions
were
given
and
so
forth,
those
are
questions
primarily
questions
of
state
law
which
would
be
resolved
at
a
due
process
hearing
prior
to
the
sale.
it
is
the
lack
of
that
mechanism
that
brings
us
to
this
court.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
your
honor,
there
is
no
contractual
power
of
sale
in
this
case.
in
the
case
of
plaintiff
jones,
the
complaint
alleges
no
contractual
authorization
for
storage
and
transportation
at
all.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
in
the
case
of
plaintiff
brooks,
the
bill
of
lading
which
was
given
to
mrs.
brooks
and
i
will
refer
you
to
page
19a
on
the
record,
in
the
most
minute
print
imaginable
refers
to
a
right
of
sale.
if
goods
are
not
claimed
at
the
shipment
upon
destination
that
refers
to
a
carriers
lien
and
the
carrier's
right
to
sale
of
the
purchasing
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
that
is
not
a
warehouse
lien.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
your
honor,
a
valid
contractual
power
of
sale
would
result
in
a
lack
of
state
action,
but
we
would
point
out
that
in
the
fuentes
case,
this
court
indicated
that
there
are
several
factors
that
might
lead,
a
court
as
matter
of
state
law
to
conclude
that
this
type
of
contractual
power
of
sale
would
be
an
invalid
contract
of
adhesion,
beyond
need
for
bargaining
power,
the
fact
that
the
term
is
not
really
bargained
for,
if
it
is
in
form
contract
to
find
print
form
contract,
these
would
be
other
factors
which
might
lead
the
court
to
conclude
that
there
was
no
valid
contractual
power
of
sale.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
if
there
is
a
consensual
power
of
sale
and
it
was
valid
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
then
we
would
not
have
a
contractual
power
of
sale.
then
in
that
case,
the
power
of
sale
would
arise
wholly
from
the
statute
and
the
sale
would
be
involuntary
act.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
that
is
right.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
agree
your
honor.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
absolutely
because
that
would
be
a
pre-requisite
for
a
valid
contractual
power
sale
and
i
say
the
distinction
is
critical
in
this
case.
the
distinction
between
contractual
voluntarily
powers
which
the
parties
agree
to
confer
upon
a
credit
such
as
the
article
9
transactions.
now,
on
the
one
hand
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
no,
we
are
not
your
honor.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
we
do
not
have
that
problem.
in
the
case
of
jones,
we
do
not
have
a
contract
at
all.
in
the
case
of
brooks,
we
say
that
that
course
does
not
pertain
to
a
warehouseman's
lien,
even
if
it
did,
it
would
be
invalid
as
a
contract
of
adhesion,
that
is
what
the
court
below
stated.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
the
quest
was
not
limited
in
that
respect,
but
i
would
have
to
concede
that
the
quest
should
be
limited
in
that
respect.
your
honors,
in
enforcing
liens,
warehousemen
have
been
engaged
in
the
enforcement
of
non-consensual
binding
dispute
resolution.
this
has
been
and
always
has
been
and
remains
an
essential
attribute
of
sovereignty.
according
to
loach,
one
of
the
great
and
fundamental
basic
purposes
of
government
is
the
protection
of
property
by
the
establishment
of
courts
to
resolve
disputes
consensually
when
the
parties
cannot
voluntarily
do
so.
from
the
early
common
law
that
remains
so
today,
self-help
remedies
have
always
been
very
strictly
limited.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
our
system
of
law
recognizes
that
a
person
who
is
interested
in
the
disputes
such
as
a
warehouseman
should
not
have
the
power.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
a
person
who
is
interested
in
the
dispute
such
as
the
warehouseman
should
not
have
the
power
to
unilaterally
resolve
that
dispute
by
the
for
sale
of
another
personâs
property
without
giving
that
other
person
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
thank
you.
