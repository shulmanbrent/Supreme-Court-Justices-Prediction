mr.
william
douglas
stein
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
william
douglas
stein,
deputy
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california,
appearing
here
today
on
behalf
of
jiro
j.
enomoto,
the
director
of
our
california
department
of
corrections.
this
case
commenced
effectively
on
november
14,
1970
with
a
major
incident
in
the
visiting
room
of
the
san
quentin
state
prison,
involving
an
inmate
named
john
wesley
clutchette,
who
was
then
confined
in
our
maximum
security
section.
as
a
result
of
that
disturbance,
a
disciplinary
hearing
was
scheduled
six
days
later
for
november
20th.
on
that
same
date,
counsel,
who
was
representing
mr.
clutchette
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution
that
was
going
on
at
that
time,
filed
a
civil
rights
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california.
that
action
sought
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
prevent
the
disciplinary
hearing
that
was
scheduled
for
that
date,
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
procedures
used
by
our
department
of
that
time
lacked
due
process
safeguards,
an
injunction
barring
such
hearings
and
$30,000
in
money
damages.
of
course,
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
denied,
but
an
order
to
show
cause
did
issue,
returnable
on
december
4th
why
a
preliminary
injunction
should
not
issue
in
the
matter.
the
day
before
i
appeared
at
that
order
to
show
cause
hearing,
the
complaint
was
amended.
the
complaint
was
amended
to
add
one
more
named
plaintiff
in
the
class
action
allegations.
since
that
time,
the
matter
has
been
considered
by
the
courts
as
a
class
action.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
to
my
knowledge,
and
i
have
not
found
a
certification,
however,
the
district
court's
opinion
discusses
relief.
it
mentions
both,
the
named
plaintiffs,
mr.
clutchette
and
mr.
jackson,
and
ordered
--
actually
ordered
expungement
of
their
disciplinary
records,
ordered
specific
relief
to
them
and
then
mentioned
plaintiffs
generally.
so,
i
have
taken
it
that
since
that
opinion
and
order
of
the
district
court,
the
matter
has
been
considered
as
a
class
action.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
not
to
my
---
no,
i
cannot
find
nothing
in
the
record
formally
certifying
it.
the
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
it
comes
up
now
and
again
in
the
case
and
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
because
any
injunction
that
ran,
it
has
always
been
my
position
that
any
injunction
that
ran
is
against
the
procedures
that
were
in
use,
since
those
procedures
were
applied
to
all
inmates.
the
issue
is
going
to
be
decided
whether
it
is
a
class
action
or
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
douglas
stein
the
named
plaintiff
is
--
john
wesley
clutchette
is
the
named
plaintiff.
he
was
subsequently
paroled
and
the
other
named
plaintiff,
george
jackson
was
killed
in
a
escape
attempt.
so
a
third
person
was
and
it
was
by
stipulation
admitted
as
a
named
plaintiff
to
prevent
the
exhaustion
of
the
class
of
plaintiff.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
we
never
had
--
we
never
--
there
was
never
any
litigation
about
the
class.
the
only
evidence
that
was
taken
--
was
taken
at
a
hearing
on
an
order
to
show
cause
why
a
preliminary
injunction
should
not
issue.
i
appeared
there
in
response
to
an
order
show
cause
about
a
particular
inmate's
disciplinary
hearing
on
a
particular
day,
involving
a
particular
incident.
at
the
close
of
that,
as
i
say,
it
was
the
day
before
the
complaint
was
amended
and
at
the
close
of
that
hearing,
the
judge
stated
that
any
injunction
he
issued
would
in
fact
be
a
permanent
injunction.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
the
order
to
show
cause
concerned
a
complaint
filed
named
one
plaintiff,
john
wesley
clutchette
in
attack
of
the
conditions
or
the
procedures
to
be
used
in
his
disciplinary
hearing
on
one
particular
date,
november,
20th.
at
the
hearing,
there
was
evidence
taken
that
the
procedures
would
not
materially
be
different,
but
as
far
as
the
factual
issue
that
we
litigated
on
december
4,
1970,
the
only
evidentiary
hearing
ever
held
in
this
case,
concerned
a
particular
incident
and
the
sole
witness
that
was
presented,
was
the
chairman
of
the
disciplinary
committee
that
heard
mr.
clutchette’s
complaint.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that
is
correct.
now,
as
i
say,
at
this
evidential
hearing
we
presented
or
he
was
called
by
the
petitioners
or
by
the
plaintiffs,
the
man
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
disciplinary
committee
that
heard
the
infraction
against
inmate
clutchette.
i
think
material
of
the
issue,
the
main
issue
about
whether
counsel
is
required
at
that
hearing?
it
is
his
testimony
that
the
standard
miranda
warning
was
given.
that
warning
had
been
given
in
california
prisons
whenever
any
disciplinary
infraction
could
be
punished
as
a
felony
since
dorado
case
in
california
which
occurred
between
escobedo
and
miranda.
he
was
specifically
informed
that
his
case
appeared
to
be
felony
and
that
it
would
be
or
it
could
be
turned
over
to
the
local
district
attorney
who
would
have
a
prosecutorial
decision
to
make
whether
or
not
to
prosecute
that
case.
clutchette
signed
a
waiver
from.
he
signed
a
from
waiving
his
miranda
rights
and
he
agreed
to
speak
to
the
committee.
now,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
remembered
that
inmate
clutchette
did
asked
for
certain
witnesses
to
be
called
and
that
was
denied.
at
that
time,
the
procedures
do
not
provide
for
any
testimony
taken
other
than
by
written
document.
he
was
unclear
as
to
whether
inmate
clutchette
requested
his
attorney's
presence,
but
it
has
never
been
litigated
between
the
parties.
the
attorney
had
sent
a
telegram
to
the
prison,
requesting
his
presence,
and
of
course,
as
i
say,
he
filed
the
action,
on
the
day
of
the
hearing,
attempting
to
stop
the
hearing
so
that
he
could
be
present.
so
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
inmate
clutchette
did
in
fact,
asked
for
the
attorney,
but
we
have
never
challenged
that.
we
have
always
conceded
that
he
did,
in
fact,
asked
at
the
hearing,
just
the
chairman
could
not
hear
it.
the
chairman
testified
that
had
inmate
clutchette
refused
to
waive
his
miranda
rights,
he
would
not
have
been
questioned.
that
they
would
have
been
in
that
situation
made
their
determination
of
the
disposition,
first
of
all,
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
disposition
on
the
basis
of
the
written
reports
they
had
before
them,
and
at
that
time,
all
of
our
disciplinary
hearings
were
conducted
on
the
basis
of
written
reports.
there
was
no
live
testimony.
the
gist
of
the
written
reports,
he
testified
were
written,
or
were
read
to
inmate
clutchette.
now,
the
reports
were
voluminous.
i
think,
there
were
13
to
15
supplemental
reports.
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
director
of
corrections
require
any
person
having
knowledge
or
seeing
incident
involving
an
incident
of
disciplinary
hearing
to
file
a
written
report.
they
were
not
given
to
the
inmate.
he
was
not
allowed
to
see
them
or
read
them.
the
material
portions
were
read
to
him
by
the
committee.
as
i
say,
the
hearing
lasted
about
an
hour
and
the
following
punishments
were
imposed.
inmate
clutchette
was
ordered,
confined
in
isolation
for
29
days,
concurrent
with
being
retained
in
cell
status
for
29
days,
his
privileges
were
removed
for
60
days,
and
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
district
attorney
for
prosecution.
the
matter
was,
in
fact,
never
prosecuted.
now,
inmate
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
at
the
start,
inmate
clutchette
was
already
housed
in
our
maximum
security
section.
so
he
was
retained
in
the
same
cell,
same
type
of
cell
as
he
had
been
in
before
the
incident.
i
believe
he
was
moved
to
a
different
cell
because
isolation
requires
the
removal
of
personal
property
from
the
inmate
cell,
except
for
legal
materials,
religious
materials
and
toilet
articles,
and
i
think
it
was
easier
to
move
inmate
clutchette
to
another
blank
cell
than
to
remove
his
goods
from
his,
what
then
would
be
property
he
should
not
have
from
his
other
cell.
so
i
believe
he
was
moved
to
another
cell
that
was
exact
same
size,
shape,
cell
that
he
had
been
housed
in
before
the
incident.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
well,
isolation
and
that
term
was
used
in
california
that
time
meant
in
the
testimony,
this
is
in
the
record,
that
all
personal
property,
items
of
personal
property
except
as
i
said,
for
religious
materials,
legal
materials
and
toilet
articles,
were
removed
from
the
cell.
then
he
would
be,
if
isolation
were
the
only
punishment,
he
would
also
be
restricted
to
the
cell
for
23
hours
a
day.
he
would
be
allowed
one
hour
a
day
exercise
outside
the
cell,
but
this
next
punishment
imposed
was
cell
status
which
alters
that
and
required
him
to
remain
in
his
cell
24
hours
a
day.
there
was
no
outside
exercise
permitted.
however,
he
was
not
isolated
in
the
sense
that
he
could
not
speak
to
other
inmates.
he
could
not
see
other
inmates'
cell
next
to
him
as
the
walls
are
solid
between
the
cells
and
there
are
no
cells
in
that
section
facing.
but
he
could
speak
through
the
bars
to
the
people
on
either
side
and
they
exercise
up
and
down
the
tier
and
he
could
talk
to
an
inmate
who
was
exercising
in
the
tier.
now,
cell
status
had
an
additional
penalty.
as
i
said,
the
one
hour
exercise
normally
allowed
inmates
and
isolation
was
removed.
so
for
29
days
he
had
no
outside
cell
exercise.
he
did
leave
the
cell
twice
a
week
to
shower,
for
family
visits,
attorney
visits,
and
for
parole
board
appearances.
that
is
allowed
on
cell
status.
in
addition,
the
removal
of
his
privileges
for
60
days
denied
him
the
privilege
of
purchasing
items
at
the
canteen
and
other
limited
privileges
that
were
available
to
maximum
security
inmates.
those
are
very
much
curtailed
because
of
his
housing
in
maximum
security.
as
i
said,
following
the
hearing,
a
permanent
injunction
issued,
expungement
of
the
records
of
the
disciplinary
proceedings
held
for
the
two
named
plaintiffs
were
ordered.
the
injunction
was
stayed,
pending
the
appeal
by
the
district
court,
except
for
the
part
of
the
opinion
that
required
us
to
present
a
plan
for
conducting
disciplinary
hearings
in
the
future
that
complied
with
the
procedure
set
forth
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
now,
we
submitted
a
plan
to
the
district
court
in
january
1972.
that
plan
was
later
put
into
practice
voluntarily
by
the
director
throughout
california’s
prisons.
as
the
plan
was
put
into
practical
effect,
certain
changes
become
obvious
that
had
to
be
made,
intervening
state,
supreme
court
judgments,
and
in
fact,
opinions
of
this
court
required
further
changes
which
were
made
subsequently,
supplemental
plans
have
been
submitted
to
the
district
court.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that
is
correct
your
honor,
unlike
the
situation
in
morris,
we
have
never
been
ordered
to
change
the
plan.
that
part
of
the
order
telling
us
to
--
permanently
enjoining
us
with
state
pending
the
appeal
and
is
still
the
state
as
this
case
is
here
today.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
certainly,
your
honor,
i
think,
we
are
because
anything
--
we
are
complaining
that,
that
plan
--
we
have
been
asked
to
draft
the
plan
to
comply
with
the
district
court's
opinion.
that
plan
has
been
objected
to
strenuously
by
the
plaintiffs
here,
by
the
way
as
not
complied,
but
to
the
extent
that
we
go
further
than
as
required
by
the
constitution,
i
do
not
believe
our
acquiescent
should
be
read
as
concession
that
is
constitutionally
required.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
the
issues,
the
specific
issues
that
we
have
raised
here
in
this
case
are
not
in
the
plan.
we
do
not
provide
counsel
where
the
matter
is
pending
as
a
criminal
trial.
we
do
not
offer
the
unlimited
right
to
call
witnesses,
that
is
it.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that
is
correct.
the
other
problem
we
have
too
your
honor
is
that
we
now
have
a
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeal
opinion
which
imposes
--
this
is
the
opinion
we
have
appealed
from
here
on
cert
review
which
imposes
procedures
waiving
on
the
constitutional
limits
as
we
read
them
and
it
is
the
ninth
circuit
opinion,
the
jurisdiction
that
ninth
circuit
takes
in
could
certainly
more
than
california.
if
that
opinion
is
affirmed
then
oregon,
washington,
arizona
and
new
mexico
and
all
federal
prisons
in
the
western
united
states
would
have
to
comply.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
it
would
require
another
lawsuit
from
oregon
or
washington,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
we
are
not,
no.
i
did
not
want
to
leave
that
impression.
as
i
say
to
the
--
just
shortly
before
wolff
was
decided
in
this
court,
the
ninth
circuit
issued
its
opinion
which
extended
the
due
process
procedures
ordered
by
the
district
court
to
the
including
of
the
removal
of
any
privilege.
we
petitioned
for
rehearing
following
the
decision
in
wolff.
a
rehearing
was
granted.
the
opinion
purportedly
modified
to
conform
to
wolff.
we
suggested
that
the
entire
circuit
hear
the
case
and
that
was
denied.
we
petitioned
for
cert
and
we
are
here
today.
i
am
here,
basically
to
argue
two
points.
the
one
that
troubles
us
the
most
and
we
argued
the
last
case
as
the
requirement
that
we
supply
counsel
in
all
cases
where
the
alleged
infraction
is
punishable
as
a
crime
and
we
would
like
to
discuss
the
--
we
view
as
a
proper
role
of
lower
federal
courts
in
imposing
constitutional
restrictions
on
the
state
prison
administrators.
briefly
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
the
first
point
is
whether
counsel
is
required
now
to
the
extent
that
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
exceeded
the
direct
mandate
of
this
court
in
wolff.
we
believe
they
have
exceeded
the
proper
rule
in
applying
the
united
states
constitution
in
state
prisons
in
such
situations
and
very
briefly
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
yes
mr.
william
douglas
stein
the
--
there
has
been
one
nagging
distinction,
purported
distinction
in
this
case
between
the
nebraska
case
that
i
think
has
been
put
to
rest
by
a
recent
california
supreme
court
decision,
decided
after
our
briefs
were
filed.
throughout
this
case,
it
is
always
been
argued
by
the
respondents
and
the
inmates
that
because
of
california’s
indeterminate
sentence
law,
their
situation
is
distinguished
from
nebraska’s
good
time
credit
sentencing.
the
distinction
being,
of
course,
in
california
where
the
judge
only
sentenced
the
defendant
to
the
term
prescribed
by
law
and
our
parole
board
sets
both
the
maximum
sentence
and
the
parole
released
date.
they
have
argued
that
because
a
single
disciplinary
infraction
of
a
major
nature
could
be
basis
for
the
parole
board's
authority
to
extend
their
sentence
to
the
maximum,
which
in
many
cases
as
life
that
it
distinguishes
them
from
the
good
time
credit
cases
such
as
nebraska
where
the
man
has
a
fixed
sentence
and
he
works
it
of
on
good
time
credit.
since
the
briefs
were
filed,
the
california
supreme
court
has
considerably
modified
the
indeterminate
sentence
law
and
its
current
application,
i
submit
renders
the
purported
distinction,
one
without
a
difference.
in
a
case
entitled
in
ray,
rodriguez
reported
at
volume
122
of
the
california
reporter
at
552,
the
california
supreme
court
required
our
adult
authority
of
parole
board
to
set
a
maximum
sentence
for
every
inmate
based
on
the
culpability
of
the
individual
offender
as
reflected
in
the
circumstances
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
that
sentence
can
no
longer
be
raised,
that
term
can
no
longer
be
changed.
it
can
be
reduced,
but
it
can
never
be
increased
back
to
the
statutory
maximum.
now,
the
complaint
--
the
plaintiffs
when
they
filed
initial
complaint,
argued
that
the
imposition
of
the
discipline
in
a
case
would
automatically
or
could
possibly
result
in
the
extension
of
their
sentences.
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
effect
to
be
too
nebulous
to
require
them
to
proceed
in
habeas
corpus
and
exhaust
their
state
remedies,
but
did
in
fact
hold
that
the
notation
of
a
single
disciplinary
could
be
so
detrimental
to
their
interest
and
liberty
through
release
on
parole,
that
the
entire
range
of
due
process
was
required.
i
summit
that
following
the
rodriguez
modification
that
you
can
no
longer
distinguish
the
california,
the
effect
of
the
california
in
determining
sentence
law
from
a
good
time
credit
situation
and
that
there
is
no
basis
on
that
ground
to
distinguish
this
case
from
wolff.
in
fact,
i
remember
in
wolff
there
was
one
particular
inmate
whose
good
time
head
up
to
i
think
17
months,
good
time
credit
removed
as
a
result
of
a
disciplinary
hearing.
in
california,
that
was
an
automatic
extension
to
sentence,
17
months,
in
california
the
most
that
could
occur
would
be
a
denial
of
release
on
parole
as
maximum
sentence
could
no
longer
be
increased
and
traditionally
the
denial
of
parole
is
always
been
reviewed
on
a
12
month
series.
so
we
submit
that
since
our
california
indeterminate
sentence
law
has
been
modified,
in
effect,
our
procedure
is
better
than
nebraska's
on
that
situation,
in
that
case.
it
cannot
be
distinguished
and
we
stand
on
a
better
footing.
the
main
issue
of
course
is
whether
a
counsel
is
required
at
these
hearings?
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
in
their
modification
of
opinion
following
wolff,
that
wolff
did
not
require
it,
but
your
decision
in
miranda
required
it.
i
know
this
has
been
argued
before
and
i
have
to
repeat
it
that
prison
disciplinary
proceedings
is
conducted
in
california
under
the
procedures
outlined
in
wolff
are
not
analogous
to
the
police
station
interrogation
that
brought
forth
the
miranda
rules.
there
is
simply
no
custody
in
the
california
disciplinary
hearing.
the
rules
provide
that
the
inmate
will
be
present,
however,
no
physical
force
will
be
used
to
bring
him
to
the
hearing
if
he
does
not
wish
to
attend
and
he
may
leave
if
and
when
he
desires.
the
hearing
is
conducted
under
the
proceedings
in
wolff.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
excuse
me?
mr.
william
douglas
stein
well,
mr.
clutchette
was
told
to
move
himself
from
the
visiting
table
to
another
room
and
he
broke
a
chair
and
assaulted
the
officers
with
a
leg
of
it.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
he
got
29
days
in
isolation
in
cell
status.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
well,
that
is
correct,
but
the
no
one
--
the
rules
specifically
provided
and
all
the
inmates
are
furnished
copies
of
these
rules,
they
are
not
kept
by
the
prison
administrators
to
themselves.
i
can
almost
quote
them
that
no
physical
force
will
be
used
to
bring
the
inmate
to
the
hearing.
so
they
do
request
his
appearance,
but
he
knows
that
if
he
does
not
want
to
go,
they
are
not
going
to
drag
him
in
there.
in
any
event,
he
arrives,
he
is
informed
that
it
is
an
informal
panel
for
his
findings
made
and
they
summit,
there
is
no
interrogation.
we
specifically
advised
the
man
of
this
fifth
amendment
rights
and
he
then
is
aware
of
it.
we
gave
him
the
opportunity.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
the
testimony
here
was
that
they
asked
the
man
how
he
will
plead
to
the
charge,
guilty
or
not
guilty.
that
if
he
requests
to
remain
silent,
he
will
not
be
questioned.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
then
they
will
question
him.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
unless
he
claims
a
privilege
and
the
rules
would
certainly
provide
that
no
adverse
interest
will
be
drawn
--
no
adverse
interest
will
be
drawn
if
he
remained
silent,
they
will
not
consider
that
adverse
to
the
inmate.
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
the
course
is
not
the
same
as
the
police
station
interrogation.
this
court
has
set
that
purposes
of
the
disciplinary
hearings
forth
better
than
i
can.
it
is
also
described
the
conditions
of
the
state
prisons
and
what
is
the
reasons
behind
this
opinions
in
preiser
and
the
tensions
and
all
that
are
involved
in
the
prison
system.
i
would
not
take
time
today
to
go
back
over
that.
as
i
say,
the
purpose
is
not
to
elicit
statements
for
use
in
subsequent
criminal
prosecution.
if
miranda
has
any
effect
at
all,
it
is
not,
there
is
no
--
i
do
not
perceive
that
there
is
a
right
to
receive
the
miranda
admonitions.
i
think
the
prison
authorities
have
the
discretion
to
either
give
them
or
not
give
them,
running
the
risk
that
if
the
inmate
says
anything,
miranda
will
be
applied
ultimately
in
a
criminal
trial
to
prevent
the
omission
of
the
statement.
we
have
voluntary
agreed
to
give
the
miranda
admonition.
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
admonition
that
was
given
probably
went
too
far,
in
that
they
advised
him
of
his
right
to
an
attorney
and
when
he
asked
about
that,
he
was
told
that
right
arose,
if
the
district
attorney
talked
to
him
or
if
he
want
to
a
criminal
trial.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
we
do
not
provide
counsel.
we
give
the
man
the
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
we
give
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
think
that
as
far
as
we
should
have
to
go,
is
to
give
the
man
--
advise
the
man
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
anything
he
says
could
be
used
against
him
in
the
subsequent
prosecution.
at
the
time
they
were
reading
from
the
standard
miranda
warning
card
and
they
went
beyond
that
and
told
him
of
his
right
to
an
attorney,
but
the
testimony
before
the
district
court
was
that
if
he
asked
for
an
attorney
he
would
be
advised
that
the
attorney
would
be
provided
if
and
when
he
was
ever
prosecuted
criminally,
but
not
up
here.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
well,
the
inmate
can
always
communicate
with
an
attorney,
that
is
true.
we
do
not
allow
the
attorney
to
--
as
in
grand
jury
situation,
remain
outside,
and
inmate
goes
back
and
forth,
no,
we
do
not
allow
that.
we
summit
that
miranda
does
not
require
that
we
furnish
attorneys.
it
gives
effectively
what
it
does
to
give
the
state
the
choice
of
either
continuing
the
questioning
the
man
or
give
him
an
attorney.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
it
is
a
rule
of
evidence
i
submit
and
it
is
fulcrum
for
its
application
as
an
ultimate
criminal
trial.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that
is
the
point
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
statistics
in
this
record
to
show
that
some
200,
in
certain
period
of
times,
some
267
inmates
were
ultimately
referred
for
prosecution.
11
of
those
inmates
were
prosecuted.
14
of
those
inmates
made
statements
characterized
by
the
respondents
as
arguably
incriminating.
i
submit
that
it
is
a
waste
of
everyone’s
time
and
effort
to
provide
267
attorneys
at
disciplinary
hearings,
when
there
is
going
to
be
ultimately
11
trials
and
even
if
every
one
of
those
11
gave
a
statement
and
that
is
not
clear.
that
due
process
can
satisfied
by
the
traditional
rules
of
volunteering.
it
is
the
omission
of
the
statement
and
an
attorney
is
a
representative
at
the
trial.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
we
to
tried
in
the
ninth
circuit
--
we
tried
to
convince
the
ninth
circuit
of
that
and
yet
they
have
in
their
opinion
said,
we
must
provide
an
attorney,
whenever
the
crime,
whenever
the
charges
criminal,
that
is
what
brings
us
here.
i
as
anyone
that
we
are
here
really
i
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
no,
he
was
not
prosecuted.
he
was
referred
for
prosecution,
but
the
prison
authorities
do
not
decide
what
is
and
is
not
a
prosecution.
that
is
the
district
attorney's
roll
when
he
was
--
when
he
receive
those
complaints.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
okay.
well,
they
generally
can
write
letters
to
attorneys
anytime,
can
hear
back
and
forth
and
they
are
given
notice
of
the
charges
well
before
the
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
time
of
notice
and
hearing,
to
say
it
was
6
days
in
this
case
and
obviously
he
got
in
touch
with
his
attorney
because
he
filed
the
civil
rights
action.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
and
interview,
there
is
visiting
provided
for
between
the
inmates
and
the
attorney,
certainly.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
oh!
yes,
even
a
man
on
cell
status
or
isolation
is
allowed
out
of
the
cell
to
--
to
be
interviewed
with
his
attorney's
visit.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
there
is
the
state
--
we
are
using
at
that
time
standard
miranda
warning
card
which
resolve
the
admonitions
and
ask
the
two
questions,
do
you
understand
and
if
you
understand
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
oh!
it
specifically
says
that
anything
you
say
can
be
used
against
you
in
the
trial,
in
the
court,
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
that
is
in
the
record.
the
admonitions
are
set
forth
and
they
were
in
the
ultimate.
he
was
first
advised
that
he
might
be
prosecuted
criminally
and
that
any
statements
he
gave
would
be
used
in
that
--
could
be
used
in
that
prosecution.
one
of
the
problems
we
have
is
that
the
after
the
wolff
decision
and
we
petitioned
for
a
rehearing
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
says
in
their
opinion
that
the
issue
of
counsel
in
this
situation
was
not
reached
by
wolff
and
they
went
to
reach
it.
we
submit
that
where
the
lower
federal
courts
are
revealing
a
state
prison
procedure,
if
they
want
to,
if
they
think
that
is
unconstitutional,
they
should
point
to
a
direct
holding
of
this
court.
they
should
not
reach
these
matters
on
decisions.
they
might
reach
where
they
are
the
ultimate
arbitrary.
they
can
reach
that,
i
submit
to
you,
in
federal
prisons
and
federal
litigations,
but
when
they
do
that
in
state
litigation,
they
limit
down
to
one,
the
total
--
the
parameters
that
we
can
experiment.
at
the
moment
we
have
every
state
in
the
western
united
states
is
bound
by
this
decision
in
clutchette
and
must
supply
counsel
and
there,
as
i
submit,
there
was
no
direct
holding
in
wolff
and
when
the
ninth
circuit
realized
that
there
was
no
direct
holding
in
wolff,
they
should
have--
at
the
most
they
could
have
issued,
i
submit,
would
be
an
advisory
opinion.
that
if
this
came
up
in
a
federal
case,
they
would
require
counsel,
but
they
should
have
remanded
this
case
to
the
state
courts
where
they
belong.
even
judge
zeppley
(ph)
at
the
close
of
the
district
--
the
hearing
we
held
in
the
district
court
notes
in
his
record
that
it
is
unfortunate
that
this
case
came
at
first
to
a
federal
court.
i
will
reserve
any
remaining
time
i
might
have
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
thank
you.
mr.
turner
correctly
pointed
out
the
ninth
circuit
did
provide
us
with
three
options,
but
in
reality
they
boiled
down
to
just
one
of
counsel
i
submit,
both
parties
are
--
postponement
is
unacceptable
to
both
parties.
we
have
been
accused
in
the
circuit
court
and
in
the
district
court
of
doing
under
the
term
classification,
but
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
we
could
not
do
as
discipline.
we
do
not
want
to
postpone
these
things
and
our
plans
for
all
cases
other
than
--
these
are
involved
criminally,
we
are
trying
to
get
this
over
in
72
hours,
that
is
the
way
to
maintain
discipline
in
state
prisons
not
with
postponement.
we
postponed
these
major
conditions
--
these
major
cases
we
have
to
confine
the
man
under
some
imposed
condition,
to
restrict
his
freedom,
to
move
about
and
we
are
accused
of
doing
by
subversion
what
we
cannot
do
directly.
use
immunity,
there
is
no
--
really
i
do
not
think
see
anything
as
use
immunity,
your
honors.
it
seems
to
me
what
we
were
talking
about
is
the
traditional
theories
and
notions
of
voluntariness
of
confessions
which
is
law,
clack
letter
law,
all
them,
but
if
the
man
is
compelled
to
make
a
statement
then
some
sort
of
use
immunity
is
required,
but
that
is
not
--
use
immunity
is
nothing
new.
that
use
immunity
is
the
trial
court's
hearing
under
johnson
v.
avery
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
statement
that
was
made.
we
agree
as
anyone
must,
that
looks
at
this
thing
that
the
prisoner
faces
a
difficult
choice.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
what
is
counsel
going
to
do
for
him?
what
role
have
we
--
this
counsel,
we
have
been
talking
about
counsel,
what
roles
do
you
see
him
to
play
here?
he
is
a
mere
advisor.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
okay,
he
faces
a
difficult
choice
if
he
can
make
some
sort
of
pitch
to
the
disciplinary
board
it
might
get
him
out
of
the
discipline,
but
might
incriminate
himself
in
the
trail
court.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
well
--
he
--
i
assume
that
--
it
might
be
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
he
might
make
a
statement
that
the
prosecutor
can
use
later
as
prior
inconsistent
statement
or
something
like
that.
he
is
certainly
not
going
to
confess
to
a
criminal
charges
as
a
way
of
getting
out
of
disciplinary,
no
that
is
not
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
he
thinks
will
help
him.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
probably
not
direct.
mr.
william
douglas
stein
perhaps
we
missed
--
mr.
william
douglas
stein
perhaps
we
misconstrued
it
all
along.
i
thank
you
your
honors
for
your
time.
