mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appears
amicus
curiae
in
these
cases
because
the
congress
has
enacted
in
various
precedents
of
signing
the
law
statutes
that
permit
capital
punishment
for
various
serious
crimes.
the
constitutional
argument
made
by
petitioner’s
counsel
in
challenging
capital
punishment
generally,
i
think
it
is
rather
diffused
and
in
fact,
i
think
part
of
its
power
or
part
of
its
persuasiveness
arises
from
its
diffuseness
and
i
will
try
to
sort
out
these
various
propositions
that
are
being
urged
and
attempt
to
show
their
inadequacies,
either
singly
or
collectively
to
outlaw
capital
punishment.
to
begin
with,
we
know
as
fact,
that
the
men
who
framed
the
eighth
amendment
did
not
intend
as
an
original
matter
to
outlaw
capital
punishment
because
it
has
been
mentioned,
they
prescribed
the
procedures
that
must
be
used
in
inflicting
it
in
the
fifth
amendment.
we
know
that
the
men
who
framed
and
ratified
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
to
intend
to
outlaw
capital
punishment
because
they
also
discussed
to
frame
the
procedures
which
must
be
followed
in
inflicting
it.
so,
we
know
that
as
an
original
matter,
as
a
matter
of
original
intention,
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
eighth
amendment
was
not
intended
to
bar
the
death
penalty
and
the
that
constitution
contemplates
its
infliction.
now,
the
petitioners
respond
to
this
in
their
brief,
by
pointing
out
that
the
fifth
amendment
also
refers
to
the
infliction
of
--
report
twice
in
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb,
which
they
say
obviously
the
eighth
amendment
would
bar
disfigurement
today.
and,
of
course
it
would,
but
i
do
not
think
that
avoids
the
argument
from
constitutional
text,
because
punishments
for
disfigurements
are
today
regarded
as
cruel
and
unusual
precisely
because
the
american
people
came
to
that
conclusion
and
legislatures
stopped
enacting
such
punishments.
so
that
today,
i
think
the
court,
if
some
legislature
and
an
aberration
tried
to
resurrect
such
a
punishment,
would
find
it
cruel
and
unusual.
but
the
point
is
it
was
not
judicial
movement
that
made
that
change.
it
was
an
evolution
of
the
standards
of
decency
in
american
society.
now,
the
eighth
amendment,
like
some
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
does
have
a
principle
of
evolution.
the
intention
of
the
framers,
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
entitled
to
an
enormous
respect,
but
one
cannot
exclude
the
possibility
that
cruel
or
unusual
punishment
means
something
different
today
than
it
meant
them,
but
the
principle
is
one
of
controlled
evolution.
the
amendment
is
not
an
uncontrolled
delegation
of
power
to
the
judiciary
to
adjudge
punishments.
there
are
criteria,
by
which
the
judiciary
adjudges
punishments
and
i
will
try
to
demonstrate
that
the
principle
of
evolution
is
applicable
here,
which
controls
the
case
here,
not
only
does
it
outlaw
the
death
penalty,
but
in
fact,
affirmatively
supports
it.
having
done
that,
i
will
urge
three
other
propositions
that
are
raised
in
eighth
amendment
context
by
counsel,
but
i
do
not
think
belong
there
and
hence
has
no
proper
place
in
this
case,
but
i
would
nevertheless
discuss
them.
i
will
suggest
first
that
capital
punishment
is
rationally
related
to
legitimate
legislative
goals
for
the
deterrence
of
crime
and
the
special
moral
outage
among
them.
secondly,
that
capital
punishment
has
not
been
shown
to
be
inflicted
on
the
basis
of
race
and
that
in
any
event,
that
question
is
irrelevant
to
the
issue
of
the
type
of
punishment.
and
thirdly,
i
would
argue
that
capital
punishment
is
not
outlawed,
because
the
criminal
justice
system,
which
is
mandated
and
permitted
by
the
constitution
has
elements
of
discretion
in
it,
which
are
intended
to
be
a
safeguard
of
the
system.
the
principle
of
evolution
that
controls
the
meaning
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause,
is
that
punishments
may
not
be
used,
which
fall
far
outside
the
main
stream
of
our
jurisprudence
and
which
are
rejected
by
the
current
moral
consensus.
that
is
consistent
with
a
history
of
the
clause
and
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
under
the
clause.
apparently,
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause
of
the
eighth
amendment,
like
the
rest
of
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted
because
the
anti-federalists,
who
objected
to
ratification
of
the
constitution,
posed
a
series
of
terrible
imaginings
about
the
coming
attorney
that
the
federal
government
would
impose
upon
the
citizens
of
states.
and,
one
part
of
the
rhetoric
employed
was
the
suggestion
that
the
federal
government
would
use
torture,
the
screw
in
the
rack
in
enforcing
its
laws.
the
eight
amendment
promised
that
that
would
not
happen
and
since
the
federal
government,
of
course,
had
no
such
intention
and
did
no
such
thing,
the
eight
amendment
became
dormant
from
its
adoption,
which
strongly
indicates
an
understanding
at
the
time
that
the
clause
was
not
to
alter
existing
practices,
but
was
to
prevent
intolerable
innovations
or
reversions.
punishments
native
to
our
jurisprudence
and
still
unused
were
simply
not
touched
by
the
clause.
the
cases
reflect
that,
we
have
discussed
them
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
but
it
was
not
until
1909
in
weems
against
united
states
that
this
court
struck
down
a
punishment
and
that
punishment
was
cruel
and
unusual
in
every
sense.
it
was
very
cruel
spanish
punishment
of
incredible
severity,
imposed
there
for
false
entries
in
official
accounts
and
this
court
said
in
that
case,
such
penalties
for
such
offenses
amaze
those
who
have
formed
their
conception
of
the
relation
of
the
state
to
even
as
offending
citizens,
from
the
practice
of
american
commonwealths
and
believe
that
it
as
a
precept
of
justice
that
punishment
for
crime
should
be
graduated
and
apportioned
to
offense
and
i
think
that
is
the
test
of
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
is
--
i
think
that
is
quite
correct.
and,
i
think
in
this
case,
weems
tells
us
what
those
words
mean,
cruel
and
unusual.
unusual
means
amazing
in
the
light
of
the
practice
of
the
american
commonwealths,
well
outside
the
mainstream
of
our
jurisprudence
that
was
putting
it
before,
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no
that
is
unusual.
i
think
cruel
is
where
this
proportionality
comes
in
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
is
right
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
is
the
infrequency
of
the
type
of
punishment.
that
is
in
weems
we
had
a
cadena
temporal,
an
extraordinary
spanish
punishment
unknown
to
our
jurisprudence
and
that
was
why
it
was
unusual
and
not
because
it
was
only
rarely
inflicted.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
know,
mr.
stewart,
but
the
court
did
not
make
a
point
on
that.
the
court
made
a
point
on
the
type
of
punishment
it
was.
now,
i
think
cruel,
as
the
court
suggested
in
weems,
means
a
punishment
which
is
amazing
in
its
lack
of
proportion
to
the
offense.
i
do
not
think
the
court
judges
the
fine
calibrations,
whether
there
is
an
exact
proportion,
i
think
it
has
to
be
so
wildly
out
of
proportion
that
becomes
cruel.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
say
that,
that
practice
is
so
out
of
step
with
the
modern
morality
and
modern
jurisprudence
that
the
state
cannot
return
to
it.
that
is
--
that
kind
of
torture
was
precisely
what
the
framers
thought
they
were
outlawing,
when
they
wrote
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no
it
is
also
that
it
is
foreign
to
our
jurisprudence
and
that
has
become
for
some
time
and
completely
out
of
step
with
our
morality,
which
has
that
become.
so,
the
state
could
not
revert
to
those
kinds
of
punishments.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do,
in
deed
mr.
justice
white.
i
accept
that
and
i
think,
however,
that
once
we
have
35
legislatures
and
congress
of
the
united
states
adopting
a
penalty,
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
it
is
in
conflict
with
current
morality.
i
think
there
is
no
other
source
of
morality
to
which
a
court
may
properly
look,
that
it
is
may
not
look
to
the
writings
of
more
enlightened
professors.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
think
the
proportionality
would
have
to
judged
for
objective
standards
as
well
that
is
not
a
--
for
example,
proportionality
would
be
judged
by
the
frequency
with
which
legislatures
choose
it.
if
one
jurisdiction
only,
suddenly
imposed
death
for
jaywalking
or
flogging
for
jay
walking,
i
think
looking
across
the
spectrum
of
the
american
commonwealth
and
seeing
that
that
was
wildly
out
of
proportion
with
every
other
jurisdiction,
would
be
one
way
of
judging
proportionality.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
doubt
very
much,
mr.
justice
white,
whether
the
court
could
say
dis-proportionateness
depends
in
a
great
part,
upon
the
moral
understanding
of
the
community.
if
the
moral
understanding
of
the
community
is
so
--
in
a
very
wide
spread
way,
views
the
punishment
as
proportionate,
i
do
not
know
what
independent
source
the
court
would
have
to
look
to.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
precisely
my
point.
i
think
once
it
is
seen
that
it
is
within
the
moral
standards
of
the
community
as
shown
by
the
legislatures
of
america,
including
the
congress
and
once
it
is
recognized
that
it
is
a
traditional
penalty
in
our
jurisprudence,
i
think
the
eight
amendment
inquiry
is
not
an
end.
in
fact,
i
think
this
case
is
not
an
end.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
was
preparing
to
suggest
that
later
in
my
argument,
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
do
not
think
--
when
i
have
said
yet
requires
it
nor
do
i
think
that
sustaining
the
validity
of
the
statute
is
now
before
this
court
requires
it.
but
i
think
other
reasons
make
it
desirable.
i
would
like
to
develop
those,
when
i
discuss
discretion.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
indeed.
now,
i
think
the
things
that
i
have
just
said,
it
may
have
been
possible,
it
was
possible
to
think
differently
about
the
moral
standards
of
the
american
community,
when
furman
against
georgia
was
decided.
i
do
not
think
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
think
differently.
there
were
factual
estimates,
empirical
judgments
made
in
various
concurring
opinions
in
furman
against
georgia,
which
were
fairly
made,
but
which
subsequent
events
has
shown
to
be
incorrect.
and,
those
proportions
in
furman
are
now
i
think
no
longer
available
as
premises
for
constitutional
judgments.
i
would
like
to
mention
them
briefly.
first
it
was
said
because
the
statutes
in
furman
provided
for
discretion,
whether
or
not
to
impose
capital
punishment
in
a
particular
case,
the
legislative
will
is
not
frustrated
if
capital
punishment
is
never
imposed.
we
know
now
i
think
that,
that
was
not
the
meaning
to
be
drawn
from
the
existence
of
discretion
in
the
statutes.
by
re-enacting
death
penalty
statutes,
many
of
them
mandatory
under
certain
circumstances,
congress
in
35
states
have
shown
that
the
legislative
will
is
frustrating,
if
the
death
penalty
is
never
imposed.
discretion
was
built
into
the
prior
statutes
to
distinguish
between
types
of
killings
and
types
of
killers.
congress
and
the
legislators,
legislatures
of
the
states
have
shown
that
if
furman
presses
them
to
the
choice,
they
prefer
a
mandatory
death
penalty
to
none.
secondly,
it
was
said
in
furman
that
capital
punishment
is
cruel
because
it
goes
beyond
what
is
necessary,
not
only
in
degree,
but
in
kind.
we
now
know
that
legislature
after
legislature
thinks
that
capital
punishment
is
necessary
in
degree
and
in
kind.
though
i
think
that
this
court
cannot
really
look
behind
that
legislative
determination,
in
a
moment
i
will
try
to
show
that
the
legislatures
have
every
reason
to
think
it
was
necessary
that
they
made
an
eminently
rational
judgment.
third
it
was
said,
in
furman
again,
that
the
penalty
is
unusual
because
it
is
infrequently
imposed.
as
i
have
just
in
response
to
the
chief
justice,
that
seems
to
me
not
the
constitutional
meaning
of
unusual.
that
unusual
refers
to
the
type
of
penalty
rare
in
our
jurisprudence.
like
cadena
temporal
in
weems
or
like
the
denationalization
in
trop
against
dulles.
indeed,
i
do
not
think
that
the
death
penalty
is
unusual
in
any
relevance
sense.
it
is
imposed
in
a
number
of
cases
each
year.
it
is
true
that
legislatures
and
juries
and
judges
restricted
to
the
most
outrageous
crimes,
but
i
do
not
see
how
it
can
become
unconstitutional,
because
it
is
used
carefully,
and
sparingly
rather
than
across
the
board.
would
it
be,
the
petitioners'
argument
seems
to
me
to
suggest
that
very
broad
categories
of
crime
for
which
the
death
penalty
was
mandatory,
would
make
it
somehow
more
constitutional.
i
think
that
is
a
very
odd
conclusion.
now,
we
submit,
therefore,
that
the
death
penalty
is
clearly
not
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
meaning
of
the
eight
amendment
and
i
submit
that
it
is
not
--
the
eighth
amendment
is
not
a
warrant
for
requiring
the
states
or
the
congress
to
come
here
and
justify
affirmatively,
the
punishment
which
they
wish
to
use,
once
it
has
been
seen
that
the
punishment
is
traditional,
the
american
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
it
is
shown
by
weems,
in
which
this
court
said
that,
here
a
man
is
given
15
years
cadena
temporal,
which
involves
painful
labor,
not
hard
labor
involves
wearing
a
chain
on
his
wrist
and
ankles,
he
is
not
allowed
to
sit
with
his
family
counsel,
he
is
deprived
of
all
rights
of
his
family
interest
of
his
life,
he
has
to
live
with
what
the
government
tells
him
to,
even
after
he
is
out
under
surveillance
and
the
court
said
to
punish,
to
inflict
that
punishment
for
a
false
entry
in
official
records,
which
can
be
done
even
if
it
is
shown
--
not
shown
to
harm
anyone
is
just
so
out
of
disproportion
with
what
american
jurisprudence
shows,
the
american
commonwealth
just
do
not
punish
that
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
pardon
me?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
disproportionate
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
meant
disproportionate
to
the
offense
as
shown
by
the
proportions
to
offenses
that
the
american
commonwealths
have
used
and,
we
look
--
the
court
says,
we
look
at
what
the
american
commonwealths
do
and
they
have
nothing,
this
severe
for
this
kind
of
offense,
maybe
two
years
in
prison.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
is
not
worth
it
and
it
is
regarded
as
immoral,
but
those
are
things
that
court
determined
in
weems
not
because
it
had
some
internal
scale
of
what
is
worth
what,
but
because
the
court
looked
to
the
practice
of
american
governments
and
said,
american
governments,
states
and
national
do
not
impose
penalties,
anything
like
that
severe
for
that
kind
of
an
offense,
this
is
just
way
out
of
proportion,
it
is
aberrational.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
maybe
part
of
it,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
court
looked
to
objective
external
standards,
rather
than
to
any
subjective
feeling
about
whether
it
is
worth
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
obviously
--
i
do
not
know,
mr.
chief
justice
because
obviously
--
well,
in
my
conclusion
in
any
event
because
there
is
simply
was
no
american
punishment
like
that
for
any
crime.
the
wearing
of
chains
and
being
sentenced
to
painful
labor
and
being
deprived
for
the
right
to
even
to
sit
in
the
family
councils,
being
deprived
of
all
civil
rights
forever,
being
required
to
live
with
what
the
government
told
you,
forever
under
their
perpetual
surveillance,
these
are
just
punishments
that
we
do
not
inflict
of
any
sort.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
mean
it
was
cruel
and
unusual?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
what
i
was
suggesting
mr.
chief
justice,
by
saying
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
is
unusual
certainly
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
have
been
suggesting,
mr.
justice
white,
that
these
judgments
are
made
by
two
factors.
is
it
a
traditional
punishment
in
our
jurisprudence,
so
that
is
not
unusual
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no
that
is
not
a
traditional
punishment
in
our
jurisprudence
for
any
crime
and
secondly
is
it
disproportionate
and
that
the
disproportionate
question
is
also
judged
by
the
practice
of
the
american
states
and
the
american
national
government
and
it
is
disproportionate
by
those
practices,
even
for
murder.
it
is
just
a
terribly
unusual
crime,
but
i
do
not
think
i
have
to
argue
that
weems
would
have
gone
the
same
way,
had
murder
been
involved.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
was
a
dissent
by
justice
white
and
justice
holmes,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
he
did,
he
did.
i
said
i
would,
having
said
i
think,
what
i
said
so
far,
i
think
disposes
of
the
case
because
i
think
there
is
no
eighth
amendment
inconsistency
here
and
to
go
on
to
the
other
arguments,
i
think
is
to
step
into
arguments
that
come
from
different
parts
of
the
constitution
are
not
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
thought
it
was
may
be
the
cruel
and
unusual
clause
that
we
are
judging,
but
perhaps
in
any
event,
i
will
go
on
to
the
others.
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
element
of
discretion
because
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
crucial
part
of
the
petitioners'
counsel's
argument
and
the
argument
appears
to
be
that
the
fact
that
various
stages
in
the
criminal
justice
system,
people
are
entitled
to
make
judgments,
renders
the
death
penalty
unconstitutional.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
logic
to
that
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
constitutional
proposition.
there
are
number
of
difficulties
with
it.
one
is
the
other
implausibility
of
the
idea.
the
framers
wrote
a
constitution
that
both
recognized
the
death
penalty
and
mandated
a
criminal
justice
system
with
discretion
in
it.
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
that
they
wrote
a
constitution
in
which
one
part
makes
another
part
unconstitutional.
the
mind
boggles
at
the
thought
that
the
constitution
is
unconstitutional.
when
two
features
have
values
which
compete,
they
have
to
be
resolved.
one
does
not
obliterate
the
other,
yet
that
is
exactly
what
we
are
being
told
happens
here.
every
element
of
discretion
the
petitioners'
counsel
complains
of,
is
either
permitted
or
compelled
by
the
constitution,
that
is
true
of
the
charging
decision,
it
is
true
of
the
plea
bargaining,
it
is
true
of
the
power
of
the
jury
to
quit,
despite
of
the
evidence.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
i
am
doing
both,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
am
going
to
suggest
that
mcgautha
was
correctly
decided
and
it
is
really
not
quite
possible
from
mcgautha
and
furman
to
live
together
and
that
though
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
decision
of
these
cases
that
it
would
be
much
better
to
overrule
furman
and
adhere
to
mcgautha.
the
states
have
been
put
to
a
choice
by
furman
that
i
think
they
ought
not
to
be
have
been
put
to.
they
have
been
put
in
the
position
of
choosing
their
second
preference
in
modes
of
imposing
capital
punishment
and
some
of
them
have
moved
to
mandatory
statutes.
i
think
that
is
unfortunate
and
i
think
they
are
ought
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
to
a
position
in
which
they
choose
the
form
of
statutes
that
they
think
is
just
and
efficient,
so
long
as
it
meets
due
process
requirements.
mr.
amsterdam
said
yesterday
that
he
thought
mcgautha
and
furman
could
live
together
and
i
take
it
that
the
argument
that
was
made
was
that
mcgautha
holds
the
jury
discretion,
meets
the
requirements
of
due
process,
but
furman
holds,
though
while
that
maybe
true
the
results
of
the
process
are
intolerable.
i
do
not
understand
how
a
process
which
produces
intolerable
results
can
be
due
process.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
necessary
contradiction
between
those
two
cases.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
quite
true
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
that
gets
us
back
into
the
position,
where
the
constitution
mandates
discretion
in
a
criminal
justice
system
and
that
discretion
mandated
by
the
constitution
renders
illegal
a
punishment
which
the
constitution
recognizes
as
legally
allowable.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
this
is
unique,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
fifth
amendment
an
d
fourteenth
amendment
say,
use
due
process
of
law
when
you
impose
the
death
penalty.
to
then
say,
that
the
procedure
by
which
you
use
due
process
of
law
makes
it
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
under
the
eighth
amendment,
so
that
all
along
we
struggle,
all
along
there
was
no
death
penalty.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
logical
impossibility.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
not
entirely
sure
that
i
do,
mr.
justice
stevens.
if
you
mean
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
think
that
it
was,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
at
least
--
at
the
moment
i
do
not
perceive
any
distinction.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
do
not
think
it
would,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
take
it
that
i
was
being
asked
whether
the
narrowness
of
the
definition
of
a
crime
or
the
number
of
crimes
made
any
difference
in
the
existence
of
discretion.
i
did
not
think
so.
i
think
the
type
of
statute
that
you
refer
to,
of
course
does
avoid
the
objection
that
was
made
in
furman.
that
is
why
i
say
that
these
cases
do
not
require
an
overruling
of
furman.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
did
not
think
so.
i
thought
it
rested
upon
the
number
--
in
part,
as
well
as
upon
discretion
in
part
upon
the
empirical
judgments
i
discussed
about
the
legislative
will
was
and
that
is
why
i
tried
to
say
that
those
empirical
judgments,
while
they
were
plausible
or
arguable
at
that
time,
has
since
been
disproved.
so,
i
think
that
part
of
furman
is
undermined.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
because,
i
think
furman
refers
to
standardless
jury
discretion,
that
is
all
it
really
applies
to.
i
think
the
statute
that
have
been
enacted
in
response
to
furman,
now
out
standards
into
the
process,
and
therefore,
it
is
not
necessary
to
overrule
furman.
but,
i
think
it
--
counsel
made
it
plain
that
he
objects
to
every
element
of
discretion
of
the
system,
not
just
jury
discretion.
he
directs
them
collectively
and
if
i
understood
him
correctly
yesterday,
he
objects
to
that,
he
would
have
object
to
them
singly.
the
power
of
an
executive
to
exercise
clemency
alone
would
render,
if
they
were
the
only
elements
of
discretion,
would
render
the
death
penalty
unconstitutional.
there
is
apparently
no
way,
according
to
this
argument,
that
anybody
can
devise
a
system
of
justice
in
which
anybody
used
any
judgment
about
a
thing,
which
could
then
inflict
the
death
penalty.
the
system
that
--
the
only
system
that
would
meet
counsel’s
objections
would
be
one
that
was
so
rigid
and
automatic
and
insensitive
that
it
would
be
morally
reprehensible
and
then
apparently
it
would
meet
the
moral
standards
of
the
constitution.
the
incidence
of
the
discretion
that
mcgautha
recognized,
that
are
built
into
our
system,
were
built
in
progressively
to
make
the
system
safer
and
progress
in
criminal
justice
has
occurred
precisely
by
multiplying
the
instances
and
the
stages
at
which
discretion
can
be
exercised.
as
the
system
now
stands,
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
one
person
or
for
several
persons
acting
freakishly
or
capriciously,
out
of
malice
or
prejudice
or
stupidity
to
inflict
the
death
penalty,
at
every
stage
it
is
possible
for
a
small
group
and
sometimes
for
one
person
to
prevent
imposition
of
the
penalty.
counsel’s
real
complaint
is
not
that
anybody
is
freakishly
convicted
and
executed,
but
rather
that
some
murderers
are
freakishly
spared
and
given
life
imprisonment.
in
other
words,
the
fault
in
the
system,
which
makes
it
unconstitutional
though
it
was
inflicted
is
that
it
errs,
if
it
errs
at
all
on
the
side
of
mercy
and
on
the
side
of
safety
and
that
what
we
are
told
makes
it
unconstitutional.
the
more
counsel
explains
that
argument,
the
less
i
understand
it.
yesterday
he
said
that
it
was
true
that
all
these
careful
procedures
that
were
worked
out
by
the
states
and
by
the
federal
government
help
some
defendants,
but
he
said
that
means
by
ineluctable
logic
that
the
procedure
is
disadvantaged
of
this.
i
have
seldom
heard
logic,
more
electable.
it
is
impossible
to
see
how
these
procedures
disadvantage
anybody
because
the
persons
who
were
not
spared,
are
not
made
worse
off.
they
were
certainly
not
disadvantaged
by
the
existence
of
a
chance
to
escape
the
death
penalty.
the
argument
i
think
is
specious,
but
there
are
other
defects
in
it.
these
arguments
that
are
made
against
the
death
penalty
could
be
made
against
any
other
form
of
punishment.
there
is
not
one
of
them
that
does
not
apply
to
life
imprisonment.
now,
the
sole
answer
that
counsel
gives
to
this
is
that
capital
punishment
is
unique.
it
is
different.
of
course,
it
is
different.
life
imprisonment
is
different
from
a
year
in
prison,
life
imprisonment
different
from
a
fine.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
suppose
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
do
not
know
how
a
life
spent
in
prison
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
you
can
cancel.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
can
undo
it,
to
the
extent
you
set
him
free
when
you
discover
the
mistake
(voice
overlap)
years
are
going.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
suggest
to
that,
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
only
one
respect
in
which
it
is
not
different
and
that
is
in
contemplation
of
the
constitution,
because
the
constitution
provides
for
it
with
imprisonment
to
us
no
line
between
them.
a
legislative
line
can
be
drawn
between
them,
but
i
do
not
think
a
constitutional
line
can
be
drawn
between
them.
it
is
the
--
capital
punishment
all
is
different
in
one
other
respect,
which
i
would
like
to
come
to
if
i
have
time.
it
is
different
in
that
it
deters
more
than
any
other
punishments.
there
are
some
categories
of
criminals,
who
cannot
be
deterred
any
other
way.
for
example,
a
man
serving
life
imprisonment
and
he
knows
it
is
a
real
life
term
has
no
incentive
not
to
kill
and
some
have
done
so.
a
man
who
has
committed
an
offense,
which
carries
life
imprisonment,
but
is
not
yet
been
apprehended
has
no
incentive
not
to
kill
to
escape
with
other
crimes,
except
the
prospect
of
a
death
penalty.
so,
that
as
the
ultimate
sanction,
capital
punishment
is
unique,
it
is
different
in
the
sense
that
it
deters
more
and
thereby
saves
more
innocent
lives.
and,
it
is
unique
in
that
it
upholds
the
basic
values
of
our
society
symbolically
and
internalizes
them
for
us,
more
than
any
other
punishment.
so,
in
its
uniqueness,
i
think
it
is
something
that
has
to
weighted
in
favor
of
punishment,
as
well.
but,
i
return
to
my
point,
i
do
not
think
it
is
unique
in
the
constitutional
sense.
and,
in
fact
the
argument
for
its
uniqueness
that
was
made
yesterday
was
that
we
recognized
it
was
unique,
because
we
surround
it
by
so
many
precautions.
so,
they
are
procedural
safeguards
that
other
punishments
do
not
have.
well,
it
think
that
is
true,
although
i
do
not
see
why
the
very
existence
of
precautions
makes
it
unconstitutional,
that
is
what
we
were
told.
presumably
the
same
thing
would
happen
if
we
began
to
add
the
same
precautions
to
life
imprisonment.
it
would
become
unconstitutional,
because
we
recognize
its
uniqueness.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
entirely
true
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
furman
case
did
took
a
step
and
attempt
of
the
legislatures
to
comply
with
that
case,
is
now
what
it
said
to
make
their
efforts
unconstitutional.
apparently,
we
are
told
that
the
only
way
that
they
could
had
a
chance
is
come
back
with
a
sweeping
mandatory
death
statute
for
all
kinds
of
crimes,
which
would
make
it
not
unique,
which
puts
me
in
a
very
strange
position.
but,
i
want
to
say
something
about
the
--
i
think
what
i
said
so
far,
is
sufficient
to
dispose
of
this
argument
that
discretion
is
what
makes
the
statute
unconstitutional.
i
want
to
say
something
else.
we
have
been
assuming
and
petitioners'
counsel
has
been
assuming
that
discretion
means
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness,
in
using
those
incentives,
they
are
not.
there
is
really
no
reason
to
assume,
certainly
mcgautha
did
not
assume,
but
certainly
our
criminal
jurisprudence
does
not
assume
it
is,
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
men
and
women,
lawyers
and
judges
who
man
our
criminal
justice
system
and
the
ordinary
people
who
man
the
grand
juries
and
the
petit
juries
do
not
take
their
responsibilities
in
capital
cases
seriously.
and
if
they
do
not
share
and
reflect
a
general,
social
understanding
of
when
a
crime
is
serious
or
heinous,
petitioners'
counsel’s
argument
really
requires
him
to
convince
this
court
that
the
more
serious
the
issue,
the
more
capricious
would
be
the
jury
and
that
the
more
standards
that
are
given
to
a
jury,
the
less
they
will
heed
any
standards.
i
think
that
is
a
reverse
argument.
as
i
said
our
system
of
justice,
rests
upon
the
thought
that
people
do
take
their
obligations
seriously
in
this
system.
mcgautha
specifically
rested
upon
that
point
and
the
evidence
suggested
that
the
framers
were
right
to
require
a
jury
as
a
way
of
eliminating
caprice
and
arbitrariness.
we
cited
the
standford
bar
view
note
in
our
brief,
which
discusses
jury
behavior
and
capital
cases
and
finds
irrational,
inconsistent
pattern.
we
have
discussed
the
book
by
professor
calvin
and
(inaudible),
the
american
jury.
now,
to
support
his
argument
that
there
is
caprice
and
freakishness
and
arbitrariness
throughout
the
system
at
every
time
a
judgment
is
to
be
made,
petitioners'
counsel
really
ought
to
have
more
than
assertion
than
adverse.
he
ought
to
come
in
here
with
a
study
for
the
entire
nation,
comparable
in
seriousness
and
scope
and
depth
to
that
what
standford
did
for
california
and
he
ought
to
come
in
to
study
only
for
the
juries,
but
for
every
stage
in
the
discretionary
process,
if
we
are
be
told
to
believe
that
there
is
no
sense
to
this
process.
the
evidence
is
there
that
there
is
sense
of
the
process.
the
assumption
of
our
system
is
the
sense
of
the
process
and
we
have
nothing
indicated
that
they
are
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
the
--
they
thought
so.
professor
calvin,
who
wrote
the
introduction
to
that
study
noted
that
he
thought
that
the
judgment
on
that
issue
was
corrupted
somewhat
by
their
desire
to
find
a
constitutional
argument
against
capital
punishment
and
he
thought
that,
that
was
not
really
an
accurate
conclusion
to
draw
other
explanations
for
it.
in
any
event,
i
do
not
think
that
–
you
see
if
we
found
a
bias
of
any
kind
in
the
system,
i
know
we
do,
it
would
not
be
an
argument
for
this
case.
in
this
goes
to
the
racial
bias,
as
well
as
any
other,
because
if
it
is
true,
that
capital
punishment
is
inflicted
disproportionately
by
sex
or
by
race
or
by
social
economic
group,
because
of
bias
not
because
of
other
reasons,
then
and
that
is
not
shown
around
here,
then
it
must
also
be
true
that
all
other
punishments
are
inflicted
with
equal
bias,
because
it
is
the
same
prosecutors,
the
same
jurors,
the
same
people
drawn
from
the
same
community,
same
judges,
the
same
governor
and
i
doubt
that
if
we
saw
a
skewing
of
the
system
according
to
some
bias
that
any
court
without
law
all
punishments
for
all
crimes.
we
would
attack
the
bias
institutionally
and
in
other
ways
to
try
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
the
system,
but
it
is
an
irrelevant
question,
it
is
question
of
what
punishment
you
will
use.
and,
indeed
in
our
brief
i
doubt
that
i
will
have
time
to
reach
the
point,
but
we
do
discuss
and
petitioners'
counsel
was
back
with
an
attack
upon
our
discussion,
which
i
still
think
it
is
correct,
the
evidence
of
racial
biased,
i
think
it
is
not
here.
there
is
some
--
in
some
studies
in
the
past,
in
this
deep
south,
at
the
time
when
blacks
were
systematically
excluded
from
grand
and
petit
juries.
i
do
not
think
there
is
enough
here
anyway
to
carry
the
bias
argument.
but
in
any
event,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
aerlex
study
on
deterrence,
which
we
are
told
is
so
worthless
that
it
would
be
utterly
disregarded,
a
point
which
i
disagree,
it
is
we
are
told
that
is
worthless.
that
study
is
a
master
piece
of
sophistication
compared
to
these,
rather
trivial
studies
of
racial
discrimination
that
one
has
to
rely
upon,
but
i
do
not
want
to
get
on
to
that
point,
because
i
wish
to
conclude
the
point
about
discretion.
i
would
examine
the
discretion
point
and
i
have
suggested
that
i
think
a
state
should
be
free
to
make
their
first
choice
about
how
the
death
penalty
should
be
decided
upon
and
i
have
suggested
that
i
do
not
think
furman
and
mcgautha
can
live
together
and
that
furman
--
i
suggest
although
it
is
not
necessary,
should
be
overruled.
the
odd
thing
about
this
case
is
the
petitioners'
counsel
argues
that
if
the
criminal
justice
system
is
too
imperfect
to
permit
the
death
penalty
at
precisely
that
moment
in
our
history,
when
the
system
has
more
procedural
safeguards
than
any
other
time
in
history
of
anglo
american
law,
indeed
that
is
his
complain
about
it,
too
many
safeguards.
the
better
our
system
becomes,
the
angry
our
opponents
become.
the
real
claim
here
is
that
the
criminal
justice
system
cannot
inflict
the
death
penalty
so
long
as
human
beings
are
running
the
system
and
making
any
judgments.
i
do
not
--
whatever
that
maybe
that
is
not
a
constitutional
argument.
ultimately,
these
five
cases,
are
cases
about
democratic
government.
the
right
of
various
legislatures
of
the
united
states
to
choose
or
reject,
according
to
their
own
judgment,
according
to
their
own
moral
sense
and
that
of
their
people,
the
death
penalty
in
accordance
with
the
constitution.
this
court,
speaking
through
mr.
justice
black,
once
before
i
think
gave
the
correct
answer
to
that
question,
in
robinson
against
united
states.
the
court
said,
“it
is
for
congress
and
not
for
us
to
decide
whether
it
is
wise
public
policy
to
inflict
the
death
penalty
at
all.
we
do
not
know
what
provision
of
law,
constitutional
or
statutory
gives
us
power
wholly
to
nullify
the
clearly
expressed
purpose
of
congress
to
authorize
the
death
penalty,
because
of
a
doubt
as
to
the
precise
congressional
purpose
and
regard
to
hypothetical
cases
that
may
never
arise.
that
statement
of
the
court,
we
submit
was
true
throughout
our
history
and
it
is
true
today
as
it
was
when
robinson
was
decided.
the
large
majority
of
the
american
states
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
have
reaffirmed
that
in
their
judgment
that
capital
punishment
is
both
moral
and
necessary
and
all
that
it
is
said
here
by
petitioners'
counsel
is
that
these
legislatures
and
the
people
they
represent
have
behaved
immorally
and
unwisely.
that
is
not
the
test
of
the
eighth
amendment.
this
case
is
merely
the
latest
in
a
continuing
series
seeking
to
obtain
from
this
court
a
political
judgment
that
the
opponent’s
of
capital
punishment
have
been
unable
to
obtain
from
the
political
branches
of
government.
the
united
states
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
death
penalty
be
upheld.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
powell,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
cannot
rationally
be
questioned
that
the
death
penalty
has
a
deterrent
effect.
mankind
has
always
thought
that
throughout
its
history.
we
know
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
and
common
observation.
we
know
that
all
other
aspects
of
human
behavior
as
you
raise
the
cost
and
the
risk,
the
amount
of
the
activity
goes
down.
i
do
not
know
why
murder
should
be
any
different.
i
would
have
not
thought
that
anybody
would
have
doubted
that
or
listened
to
a
couple
of
academicians
who
doubted
it
and
we
introduced
the
aerlex
study
and
the
yonkers
(ph)
study,
only
to
show
that
there
is
respectable
academic
evidence
on
the
side
of
deterrence,
but
i
would
have
thought
that
it
is
common
sense
and
i
would
thought
that
in
fact,
the
judgment
of
the
legislatures
of
this
country
that
they
think
it
deters
is
enough
--
it
is
irrational
judgment.
i
think
it
is
enough
for
this
court
and
i
must
say,
at
the
time
when
international
and
domestic
terrorism
is
going
up,
at
a
time
when
brutal
murders
are
going
up,
it
is
an
awesome
responsibility
to
take
from
the
states,
what
they
think
is
a
necessary
deterrence
and
save
a
few
hundred
people
and
thereby,
probably
condemn
to
death,
thousands
of
innocent
people,
that
is
truly
awesome
responsibility.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
justice
marshal,
many
things
affect
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do
not
know
how
one
can
say
that
it
did
not.
you
cannot
deter
perhaps
an
existing
addict,
which
maybe
the
reason
for
robinson
against
california,
but
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
you
cannot
deter
people
from
becoming
addicts,
from
taking
the
first
step.
