mr.
john
p.
farrell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
respond
first
to
a
couple
of
factual
matters
as
to
the
horvath
case.
the
issue
there
is
whether
a
suit
could
be
brought
in
the
state
courts
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act
and
if
so
the
application
of
the
tort
claims
act.
under
the
california
tort
claims
act
itself
there
would
be
immunity
for
discretionary
acts
and
an
absolute
immunity
for
malicious
prosecution.
and
then
in
the
california
courts
they
would
be
the
general
common
law
defense
as
to
defamation
and
use
of
testimony
at
trial,
but
there
is
a
special
statutory
remedy
for
person
convicted
with
crime
who
is
later
pardoned
and
compensation
can
be
provided
under
statutory
scheme
for
portion
of
his
sentence
he
served.
so
that
is
not
a
suit
against
the
prosecutor
to
suit,
a
claim
filed
with
the
state
under
penal
code
section
4900.
it
is
in
our
list
of
remedies
that
are
available
to
a
person.
so
there
is
a
monetary
scheme
available
without
a
suit
being
maintained
under
the
california
law
against
the
prosecutor.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
there
is
not
a
damage
remedy
against
the
prosecutor.
there
is
a
claim
for
monetary
compensation
for
person
who
is
deemed
to
be
unjustly
convicted.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yes.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
under
the
tort
claims
act.
he
would
have
an
absolute
immunity
from
malicious
prosecution
and
under
the
tort
claims
act,
all
common
law
defenses
as
to
the
use
of
testimony
would
apply
and
i
would
feel
that
that
would
clearly
cover
the
matter.
also,
there
is
a
decision
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
he
is
absolutely
immune
from
malicious
prosecution.
that
specifies
clearly.
he
is
immune
for
discretionary
acts
together
with
other
officials
and
all
common
law
defenses
apply
under
the
tort
claims
act
and
the
common
law
defense
for
defamation
or
the
use
of
testimony
during
trial
in
the
quasi-judicial
immunity
which
we
are
arguing
here
would
be
also
have
to
fall
under
the
california
tort
claims
act.
as
a
general
common
law,
quasi-judicial
immunity
would
be
applicable
in
the
california
tort
claims
act
and
at
present
certainly
in
the
law
of
california,
he
could
not
recover
for
the
same
reason
that
we
are
arguing
here
basically,
that
is
the
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
the
quasi-judicial
immunity
under
the
common
law
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
right.
the
common
law
of
quasi-judicial
immunity
would
apply
any
statutory
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
because
it
is
absolute
under
the
common
law.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yes,
because
the
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
right.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
yes
there
is
a
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
it
is
a
crime.
yes,
there
is
in
turn
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yes,
he
could
be
convicted
of
it.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
right.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
there
is
no
--
at
present,
certainly,
there
is
no
rule
of
that
kind.
the
quasi
judicial
immunity
of
a
prosecutor
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
a
judge
could
also
do
that.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
right
that
would
probably
a
legislator
conceivably,
if
it
were
a
legislative
act
that
would
be
difficult
to
imagine.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
the
california
cases
are
pretty
much
along
the
line
of
the
general
national
cases.
a
clerk
for
instance,
a
probation
officer
giving
a
sentencing
report
to
a
judge,
a
clerk
of
the
court
carrying
out
a
directive
of
the
judge,
typically
a
sheriff
or
a
marshal
carrying
out
a
directive
of
the
judge.
i
think
quasi-judicial
immunity
has
two
branches.
one
branch
is
a
person
who
is
exercising
a
discretion
that
is
similar
to
that
exercised
by
a
judge
and
so
quasi-judicial
immunity
is
sometimes
used
be
civil
service
commission
for
instance
because
it
is
making
a
determination
of
facts
like
a
judge.
the
other
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
the
decision
to
prosecute
is
like
a
judge.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yes,
that
is
taken
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
the
decision
on
what
evidence
to
present
weighing
the
evidence
to
present,
weighing
the
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
a
defense
counsel,
well,
there
has
been
several
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
there
has
been
court
of
appeal
decisions
saying
that
if
a
public
defender
for
instance
who
has
been
sued
under
civil
rights
act
is
quasi
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
he
cannot
be
sued
for
it.
basically
he
cannot
be
sued
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
basically,
a
private
defense
counsel
could
not
be
sued
for
what
he
did
in
the
courtroom.
if
mr.
hanson
for
instance,
i
have
several
factual
errors,
i
am
sure
he
made
in
good
faith,
but
i
could
not
sue
him
or
mr.
pachtman
could
not
sue
him
for
him
what
he
argued
here
about
the
knowing
use
of
perjury.
for
him
calling
mr.
pachtman
a
perjurer
because
defamation
is
an
absolute
immunity
for
presentation
at
the
courtroom
in
the
pleadings
and
in
the
argument
to
a
court
and
the
reason
for
that
it
is
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
but
that
is
an
absolute
immunity.
that
is
what
private
counsel
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
a
civil
suit
for
subordination
of
perjury
against
the
private
lawyer,
only
a
government
lawyer.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
i
cannot
think
of
any
private
action
unless
perhaps
some
intention
and
put
you
on
motion
of
the
distress.
the
remedy
for
subordination
of
perjury
was
criminal.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
but
that
would
not
be
malpractice
if
it
be
against
the
opponent.
there
would
be
no
contractual
relationship
there.
i
think
under
the
common
law,
a
private
counsel,
in
fact,
there
would
be
no
civil
remedy
that
would
be
available
to
his
opponent
from
the
subordination
of
perjury
because
he
could
not
get
them
for
defamation
or
the
use
of
testimony
and
there
would
be
no
other
action
available.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
and
that
is
a
very
sufficient
remedy
i
would
think.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
i
would
not
do
it.
we
are
only
civil
counsel.
we
would
not
do
that.
we
defend
and
we
do
not
prosecute.
it
would
be
the
attorney
general
in
all
likelihood
would
bring
it
or
a
federal
prosecutor
could
bring
him
for
violation
of
the
criminal
provisions
of
the
civil
rights
action.
there
certainly,
i
think
there
are
two
branches
as
we
presented
of
the
civil
rights
action.
you
could
view
1983
as
one
to
help
enforce
a
standard
of
behavior
and
second
to
provide
some
forms
of
redress.
well,
as
to
enforcing
a
standard
of
behavior
there
is
a
criminal
action
that
can
be
brought
by
the
u.s.
attorney.
we
present
all
the
criminal
actions
that
can
be
brought
by
the
state
government
against
him.
there
is
a
judge
sitting
there
who
assumedly
is
fair.
this
matter,
for
instance,
went
all
the
way
through
the
california
courts
who
upheld
the
prosecutor
all
along
the
way.
not
only
that,
there
was
then
the
right
to
petition
this
court
for
certiorari
and
there
was
the
final
right
which
was
exercise
of
bringing
a
habeas
corpus
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
no,
there
may
be
–-
well,
first,
he
is
not
protected
certainly.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
i
am
not
sure
if
he
bribed
the
person.
the
act
of
bribery
would
not
be
taking
place
in
the
courtroom
and
would
be
a
separate
action
of
transferring
money.
i
think
as
to
the
action
of
transferring
money
that
is
not
a
prosecutorial
act.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
i
do
not
think
he
would,
for
the
payment
of
a
bribe,
i
do
not
think
he
would
be.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
that
is
not
a
prosecutorial
act.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
right.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
i
am
saying
it
is
not
the
type
of
action
that
is
typically
prima
facie
disregarding
motive.
it
is
not
a
prosecutorial
act
to
punch
someone.
if
you
were
to
ask
a
question
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
right.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
right.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
it
is
not
normal
to
do
an
evil
thing.
i
think
we
can
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
it
is
not
normal
prosecutorial
behavior
to
do
something
evil
and
criminal,
but
the
action
of
asking
the
question
is
normal
prosecutorial
behavior
and
that
is
what
is
the
key
too,
just
as
in
judicial
immunity
and
in
legislative
immunity.
it
is
the
form
of
the
act
whether
the
act
is
normal
behavior
disregarding
motive
because
there
is
nothing
easier
than
alleging
him
proper
motive,
certainly
nobody
is
going
to
bring
a
lawsuit
in
act
in
alleged
good
faith.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
i
think
he
is
asking
the
question
in
the
courtroom
definitely.
the
asking
of
the
question
in
the
courtroom
is
the
normal
action
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
there
may
possibly
be
separable.
the
action
of
threatening
if
that
could
be
pinpointed
as
a
separate
location
as
a
separate
action
which
would
not
be
normal
action
of
the
prosecutor,
but
the
action
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
but
not
by
characterization
of
motive
and
not
by
characterization
of
whether
it
is
true
or
false.
we
do
not
know
whether
this
testimony
is
perjured.
the
california
supreme
court
held
specifically
it
was
not.
the
federal
district
court
judge
reading
the
record
of
the
california
supreme
court
nine
years
later
or
six
years
later,
said
it
was
false.
he
did
not
say
it
was
perjury.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
i
think
the
act
of
bribery.
the
act
of
paying
over
the
money
would
not
be
a
normal
prosecutorial
function.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
right.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
he
is
as
to
the
decision.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
i
am
not
sure
that
those
cases
are,
i
have
read
some
of
the
cases
and
they
usually
are
suing
him
for
rendering
a
verdict
by
virtue
of
bribery.
well,
that
is
like
saying
absolute
knowingly
soliciting
perjured
testimony,
rendering
the
verdict
is
what
judges
do.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well
that
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
if
he
can
prove
the
prior
act
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
i
am
trying
to
say
that
they
are
the
same
thing
that
the
act
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no.
there
would
be
for
the
soliciting
of
the
testimony
at
the
trial,
if
there
were
alleged
and
proved
that
payment
of
money
outside
the
court
that
is
a
not
a
normal
prosecutorial
act
and
i
think
that
is
subject
to
proof.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
he
is
immune
as
to
the
presentation,
the
production
of
the
testimony
of
trial
and
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
if
the
taking
of
the
money
could
be
proved
there
is
a
separate
act.
i
think
it
does
not
fall
within
the
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
you
might
be
able
to
prove
up
some
damages
from
that,
but
i
think
the
act
would
be
the
violation,
that
would
not
be
immune
would
be
an
act
that
was
not
within
the
normal
scope
of
the
prosecutor's
function
disregarding
allegations
of
motive.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yes
and
i
think
normally,
a
prosecutor
for
instance
files
an
information
or
whatever
in
that
jurisdiction.
he
files
an
information,
he
goes
to
court.
he
solicits
testimony.
he
makes
a
closing
argument.
he
files
reports
to
the
clemency
boards.
he
participates
on
appeals.
he
argues
on
appeals.
as
for
those
acts
and
those
acts
he
is
acting
within
a
quasi-judicial
capacity
and
if
you
allege
that
he
did
those
improperly.
he
did
it
criminally.
he
did
it
maliciously
as
to
those
acts
he
is
immune.
now,
if
you
can
say
well
on
his
way
here,
he
took
a
witness
and
beat
him
up
to
keep
him
from
coming,
the
act
of
beating
up
a
witness
does
not
prima
facie
appear
to
be
a
prosecutorial
act,
that
is
not
what
prosecutors
normally
do.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
as
to
the
delivery
of
the
money
and
the
acceptance
of
money,
yes,
that
is
not
within
the
normal
scope
of
it.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
if
you
could
prove
up
to
that,
you
might
well
be
able
to
prove
that.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
it
is
quite
different
because
it
is
very
easy.
at
the
end
of
any
trial
there
is
nothing
easier
than
saying
the
prosecutor
maliciously
misstated
the
fact
and
in
this
case
that
is
the
exact
sort
of
things
we
have.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
the
state
cases
are
largely
the
same.
i
cannot
say
for
every
state,
but
in
my
own
research
i
went
to
the
federal
cases
because
of
the
civil
rights
action.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yes,
they
are
so
far
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
of
course
the
state
–-
this
of
course
is
still
in
the
state
of
flux,
but
the
state
courts
are
following
federal
law
in
1983
actions
in
the
state
courts,
at
least
in
california,
but
as
to
the
state
law
in
california
if
you
are
quite
confident
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
i
think
it
is
the
same.
well,
pierson
was
on
the
defamation
immunity.
i
think
in
general
it
is
clear
that
the
state
law
is
the
same
as
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
but
i
think
if
you
looked
into
the
matter
you
would
find
it
would
be
very
much
like
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yes,
i
think,
in
proser
we
are
on
the
defamation
immunity
and
cited
the
law
of
england
as
well
and
the
reason
i
want
it
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
i
want
to
correlate
it.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
the
reason
i
wanted
to
correlate
the
defamation
immunity
with
this
and
judicial
immunity
and
legislative
immunity
is
alleged
--
the
rule
in
this
court
has
been
that
immunity
under
1983
is
really
a
question
of
statutory
construction
and
the
statutory
construction
has
always
proceeded
from
the
fact
that
what
the
immunity
was
at
common
law
applies
under
1983.
so
this
court
found
that
under
the
common
law,
there
was
absolute
judicial
immunity
and
applied
it
under
1983.
the
same
thing
with
legislative
immunity.
as
to
executive
immunity,
for
instance,
peace
officers
found
that
at
the
common
law
peace
officers
when
he
had
a
defense
in
good
faith
and
reasonable
cause
and
apply
at
that
under
1983
and
the
same
is
true
with
scheuer
versus
rhodes
and
the
strickland
case.
all
of
them
cited
common
law
tradition.
well
in
this
case,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
which
are
overwhelmingly
perhaps
eluding
it,
have
in
fact
studied
and
they
themselves
cite
a
lot
of
state
cases,
the
earlier
ones
in
particular.
i
think
yaselli
versus
goff
is
probably
the
best
of
this
entire
string
of
decisions
and
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yaselli
versus
goff
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
--
which
is
the
earliest
case
and
it
itself
relates
defamation
immunity
and
the
reason
why
defamation
immunity
is
also
important
is
defamation
immunity
intends
to
allow
a
counsel
in
the
presentation
of
this
case
to
be
free
from
worrying
about
civil
liability
as
to
himself
personally.
so
it
is
defending
the
act
of
asking
questions
and
presenting
evidence
at
trial.
now,
if
you
are
going
to
turn
around
say
1983
though
allows
against
state
prosecutors,
suits
for
the
questions
they
asked
and
the
evidence
they
present
at
trial,
then
you
have
undercut
the
defamation
immunity.
the
only
thing
you
cannot
be
sued
for
is
defamation.
so
if
you
are
private
counsel,
you
are
home
free
and
clear
basically
because
there
is
no
other
cause
of
action
lying
against
you,
but
if
you
are
a
state
official,
unhappily,
you
will
be
subject
to
suits
for
everything
you
say
or
present
at
trial
which
means
you
cannot
argue
a
trial
without
worrying
about
the
fear
of
suit
and
i
think
this
case
is
a
good
case.
factually
it
was
an
8-day
trial
and
the
type
of
things
judge
ferguson
found
that
we
are
so
terrible
that
mr.
pachtman
did
were
things
where
there
was
a
statement
that
the
witness
said
he
voluntarily
committed
himself
to
a
mental
institution
and
this
was
discussed
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
1962
at
appendix
page
12.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
right
and
this
is
just
an
example.
the
question
of
whether
he
was
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
committed.
that
is
discussed
at
both
page
12
and
page
22,
footnote
3
and
the
california
supreme
court
concluded
at
the
trial,
however,
because
costello
apparently
only
meant
that
he
voluntarily
pleaded
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
in
fact
that
is
what
he
says.
now,
this
is
an
eight-day
trial
and
the
prosecution
is
supposed
to
pick
up
on
the
word
voluntarily.
mr.
hanson,
i
am
sure
in
good
faith
forgot
that
these
particular
provisions
were
in
here
when
he
said
that
the
mental
capacity
was
not
discussed
by
the
california
court.
it
is
easy
to
make
a
mistake
in
a
half
an
hour
argument
on
facts.
here
is
the
prosecutor,
on
a
1961
trial
going
to
pick
on
questions
like
this
and
other
claim
by
judge
ferguson
is
that
costello
said
he
had
not
seen
mug
shots,
but
had
seen
a
mug
book
of
the
imbler
before
he
identified
him
at
the
line
up
and
he
admitted
he
had
seen
12
pictures
including
imbler's
in
a
mug
book.
judge
ferguson
said
that
was
not
a
mug,
therefore,
he
falsely
testified
he
had
not
seen
mug
shots,
although
he
admitted
in
the
same
line
of
questioning
that
he
had
seen
a
mug
book.
now,
these
are
the
type
of
nitpicking
questions
in
an
eight-day
trial
that
can
be
brought
up
in
the
civil
case
and
called
knowing
use
a
false
testimony.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
it
came
as
the
credibility.
he
said
he
was
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
i
brought
this
up
as
an
example.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
i
do
not
want
to
give
up
the
absolute
immunity.
what
i
was
saying
is
this
is
the
type
of
thing
that
prosecutors
will
be
exposed
to.
the
person
testified
as
set
out
in
page
23
that
i
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
which
caused
me
to
be
committed.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
i
would
like
to
then
respond
to
that.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
i
do
not
think
that
could
be
--
from
our
point
of
view,
in
general,
say
as
county
counsel
i
am
sure
we
would
prefer
that
in
a
wide
open
attack
on
prosecutors.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
but
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well
the
county
would
not,
is
prohibited
from
paying
punitives
and
there
is
a
million
and
a
half
dollars
in
punitive
damages
sought.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
the
compensatory
damage
might
well
be
paid
by
the
county
that
is
a
question
that
is
being
decided
by
this
horvath
case
which
is
before
the
california
supreme
court.
it
might
or
might
not.
to
this
point
the
county
is
taken
the
position
and
paid
compensatory
damages
in
federal
civil
rights
act.
so
unless
the
california
supreme
court
ruled
otherwise,
compensatory
damages
would
be
paid,
but
at
for
the
habeas
corpus
it
is
an
irrational
determinant
because
first
of
all
people
acquitted
will
not
have
a
chance
to
have
a
habeas
corpus
decision.
secondly,
mr.
pachtman
was
not
represented
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
only
the
attorney
general
was
there.
we
would
be
the
civil
attorneys.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
he
was
not
even
there.
he
had
testified
at
the
reference
hearing
in
1963.
he
did
not
even
know
this
was
going
on.
he
was
not
there.
that
is
clear.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
he
would
not
normally
know.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
they
might
but
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
within
the
bureaucracy
it
would
not
be
necessary
because
mr.
imbler
was
in
the
custody
of
the
warden.
when
he
is
in
the
custody
of
the
warden,
the
response
is
made
by
the
attorney
general
and
so
there
is
no
reason
for
either
the
district
attorney
to
be
there
or
the
county
counsel
who
is
the
civil
attorney
for
the
district
attorneys,
but
if
this
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
they
would
not
normally
do
so.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
they
would
not
get
in
touch
with
county
counsel,
definitely.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
they
might
or
might
not.
i
do
not
know.
i
could
not
honestly
respond
to
whether
it
is
normal
or
not,
but
there
are
500
deputy
district
attorneys
in
the
county
of
los
angeles
and
there
are
about
500
deputy
attorney
generals
in
the
state
of
california
and
i
know
from
habeas
corpus
that
we
do
not
get
in
touch
unless
we
feel
we
have
to.
there
is
just
so
much
volume
of
matters
coming
into
that
that
if
we
go
over
there
in
the
matter,
we
do
not
get
in
touch
with
them
until
some
time
later
on.
so
i
do
not
know
whether
they
did
or
not,
but
in
fact
he
was
not
present.
he
was
not
a
witness
and
was
not
present
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
but
think
of
the
impact
on
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
think
we
are
weighing
here
an
enormous
impact
we
will
have
on
the
process
of
criminal
justice
against
a
private
claim
for
monetary
compensation
and
if
habeas
corpus
hearings
are
going
to
decide
the
right
to
monetary
compensation,
i
think
it
would
be
only
reasonable
to
assume
greater
interest
in
habeas
corpus
hearing
by
the
civil
attorneys
with
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
represented
there.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
county
counsel
for
instance
would
want
to
start
being
present
and
the
city
attorney
would
want
to
start
being
present
and
sometimes
that
might
be
to
the
good,
but
it
certainly
could
slow
up
the
habeas
corpus
writ
which
has
been
the
purpose
of
habeas
corpus
has
been
to
decide
lawful
custody.
we
would
then
be
converting
the
writ
to
decide
lawful
custody
into
a
precondition
for
a
civil
suit
and
you
cannot
do
that
without
having
a
ramification
from
the
civil
lawyers
coming
in
and
i
think
that
plus
the
fact
that
people
will
not
have
that
benefit
at
all
who
would
tend
to
eliminate
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
a
proper
terminate
for
civil
liability.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yes.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
no,
it
is
not.
certainly,
under
the
civil
rights
act,
while
he
was
in
custody,
it
would
be
probably
improper
under
perez
versus
rodriguez,
it
would
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
now,
that
he
is
out
i
do
not
know
what
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
might
lie
as
two.
that
would
be
the
only
question,
but
i
think,
for
instance,
prior
to
the
trial,
you
would
have
a
pending
prosecution
and
you
would
have
younger
versus
harris
,if
there
were
something
that
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
could
at
this
time,
correct,
i
think
it
would
lie.
i
dubious
that
there
are
grounds
for
equitable
jurisdiction
though
and
i
think
that
would
be
the
problem
with
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
but
no,
this
is
an
historic
common
law
immunity
as
to
damages
and
as
other
forms
of
redress
that
still
open
to
the
person.
he
can
still
get
his
usual
remedy
for
criminal
prosecution.
the
district
attorney
certainly
is
under
severe
restrictions,
for
instance,
by
the
trial
judge,
jury
instructions,
mistrial
granted
and
the
difference,
what
characterizes
the
difference
between
this
and
the
executive
say
in
scheuer
versus
rhodes
is
basically
the
sixth
amendment.
and
that
is
the
distinction
that
what
the
prosecutor
does
in
presenting
cases
at
trial
is
subject
to
all
the
restraints
of
the
sixth
amendment.
there
is
an
adversary
there.
there
is
an
impartial
judge,
there
is
an
impartial
jury.
there
is
a
public
trial.
it
is
all
taking
place
in
public.
he
is
subject
to
public
censure.
so
the
sixth
amendment
characterizes
the
difference
between
a
prosecutorial
act
and
an
executive
act.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
well,
the
right
to
counsel.
what
he
does
at
trial,
why
it
is
different
in
one
executive
does
and
the
adversary
is
sitting
right
there.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
he
is
executive
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
he
is
an
executive
in
one
form
or
another.
in
california,
he
is
an
independently
elected
officer.
he
is
not
appointed
by
the
governor
or
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
attorney.
so
he
is
an
independent
executive
officer
who
basically
does
anything,
but
judicial
matters.
so
he
is
not
executive
in
the
sense
you
response
to
an
executive
power
directly,
but
what
he
does
is
done
in
public.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yes,
he
supervises
district
attorneys
under
the
california
constitution
and
he
can
prosecute
them
and
if
there
is
a
conflict
he
can
come
in
and
he
is
to
enforce
the
law
against
them
as
well
and
the
grand
jury
is
to
enforce
the
law
against
him,
but
what
the
prosecutor
does
in
the
courtroom,
what
he
does
and
indicts
his
subject
to
the
constant
review
with
the
court
do
to
the
sixth
amendment.
he
has
an
adversary
and
that
is
i
think
the
great
distinction.
well,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
yes,
what
i
was
--
mr.
john
p.
farrell
right.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
the
first
emphasis
is
on
the
discretion
which
is
similar
to
a
judge
and
the
second
meaning
is
when
the
person
closely
identified
and
subject
to
the
control
of
the
judge
and
quasi-judicial
immunity,
for
instance,
has
been
given
to
marshals
and
sheriffs
and
clerks
carrying
out
the
orders
of
the
court
where
there
is
no
great
discretion
but
it
is
identified
with
the
judicial
process.
mr.
john
p.
farrell
supporting
personnel
and
people
are
acting
under
their
control
and
i
think
i
was
trying
to
say
what
district
attorney
is
both
exercising
the
discretion
which
is
similar
to
a
judge
and
he
is
there
when
he
is
arguing
a
case,
when
he
is
presenting
evidence
to
the
court
is
subject
to
the
constant
control
of
the
court,
and
so
he
falls
under
both
ends
of
quasi-judicial
definition.
