mr.
roger
s.
hanson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
presented
before
the
court
today
is
the
case
of
imbler
versus
pachtman
which
presents
an
issue
which
has
been
litigated
many,
many
times
at
the
circuit
court
level
throughout
the
united
states
and
that
is
the
question
of
the
immunity
or
the
liability
which
falls
upon
a
public
prosecutor
under
the
42
u.s.c.
1983
civil
rights
act
and
statute
where
in
this
particular
case,
there
has
been
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
of
knowing
use
of
perjury
and
also
presents
the
rather
unique
set
of
facts
that
prior
to
the
initiation
of
this
lawsuit,
there
has
been
continuous
litigation
throughout
the
california
supreme
court
through
the
united
states
district
court
in
los
angeles,
u.s.
ninth
circuit
and
so
forth
where
we
have
opinions
which
have
determined
and
fixed
that
there
was
in
fact
knowing
use
of
perjury
and
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
granted
under
22
u.s.c.,
28
u.s.c.,
2254
for
this
knowing
use
of
perjury.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
am
glad
you
asked
that
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
in
fact
the
opinions
of
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
address
themselves
as
thoroughly
as
opinion
of
u.s.
district
judge
warren
ferguson
in
los
angeles.
this
was
due
to
a
multiplicity
of
reasons.
it
was
due
to
inadequate
briefing
in
my
opinion
on
the
lawyers.
it
was
due
to
perhaps
an
over
ignoring
by
the
california
supreme
court
of
some
of
the
things
that
are
place
in
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
napue
versus
illinois.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
plus
petition
was
made
by
the
state
of
california
to
this
court
to
have
that
reviewed
and
it
was
nine
to
nothing
against
voting
any
hearing.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
know
that
because
i
opposed
it.
i
was
asked
to
file
a
petition
in
opposition.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
there
was
no
votes
that
suggested
certiorari
be
granted.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
know
that
some
of
the
denials
of
certiorari
are
accompanied
by
mr.
justice
x
and
mr.
justice
y
would
grant
certiorari
in
this
case.
so
i
am
basing
it
on
that.
of
course
i
do
not
have
access
to
how
the
voting
took
place
other
than
that,
but
i
can
assure
this
court
that
within
the
meaning
of
28
u.s.c,
2254,
the
same
record
was
examined
by
the
federal
district
judge
in
los
angeles.
there
is
no
new
evidentiary
hearings
took
place
and
based
on
that
record,
the
opinion
at
298
f.
supp.
795
was
prepared
and
that
opinion
is
accurate
and
accurately
reflects
what
took
place
in
this
case.
those
findings
for
that
district
judge
are
more
complete
than
the
california
supreme
court
and
in
fact
are
accurate
situation
that
occurred
here,
and
you
know,
i
cannot
force
the
california
supreme
court
to
make
findings
and
they
also,
when
they
granted
in
order
to
show
cause
in
the
california
supreme
court,
they
restricted
the
inquiry
by
certain
questions
which
narrowed
down
the
scope
that
they
were
going
to
take
a
look
at
in
the
significant
napue
versus
illinois
situation
that
occurred
in
this
case,
was
really
ignored
by
them.
namely,
unquestionably,
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
knew
of
certain
false
statements
that
were
being
made
by
his
witness
and
he
chose
not
for
whatever
reasons
he
had
at
that
time
to
correct
them.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
understand.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that
is
correct.
no
question
about
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
now,
as
to
that
particular
situation,
there
is
no
question
that
the
national
ballot,
if
you
count
up
all
the
cases
that
have
gone
one
way
versus
the
other
way,
overwhelmingly
is
against
the
petitioner
in
this
particular
case,
just
without
question.
however,
there
has
been
some,
in
my
opinion,
correctly
made
inroads
out
of
the
u.s.
sixth
circuit
in
ohio
in
the
case
of
hilliard
versus
williams
which
again
has
been
decided
by
them.
i
do
not
have
the
new
citation
on
it,
but
it
went
up
on
the
damages
the
second
time
and
the
u.s.
sixth
circuit
again
affirmed
that
line
of
reasoning
and
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court
to
more
correctly
determine
damages
about
the
$1.00
limit
that
was
awarded
at
the
time
of
the
trial
by
the
district
judge.
so
i
think
the
situation
boils
down
to
what
type
of
case
are
we
going
to
permit
this
in?
i
do
not
ask
the
court
and
i
do
not
think
it
is
really
necessary
to
ask
the
court
to
say,
yes,
the
floodgates
ought
to
be
opened
to
allow
any
sort
of
lawsuit
to
be
filed
against
the
public
prosecutor.
i
do
not
think
that
is
a
situation
at
all.
i
think
there
are
many
safety
valves
that
can
be
accorded
here
and
still
allow
the
suit
to
be
filed
on
its
merits
and
among
them
are
certainly
pre-trial
hearings,
whereby
the
district
judge
would
inquire
into
the
merits
of
the
case
and
inquire
into
what
i
believe
to
be
the
four
things
that
must
really
be
inquired
in.
number
one,
did
he
do
a
good
faith
act?
number
two,
was
his
act
within
his
discretion?
number
three,
was
it
within
something
provided
by
law
and
number
four,
was
it
within
his
jurisdiction?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that
is
very
possible.
that
is
very
possible,
but
the
good
faith
act
would
be
within
the
jury’s
question,
no
question
about
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
do
not
believe
in
almost
every
case,
certainly
not
in
this
case,
certainly
not
in
this
case,
that
is
before
the
court
now.
in
other
words,
what
i
am
saying
is,
if
there
is
an
allegation
of
knowing
use
of
perjury
or
something
of
that
nature
which
is
clearly
without
the
scope
of
his
duty,
without
the
scope
of
his
jurisdiction,
not
provided
by
law
condemned
by
all
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
well
as
the
california
supreme
court
and
any
court
you
want
to
pick
up,
that
is
something
that
i
think
has
to
stand.
it
has
to
go
to
the
jury,
they
have
to
respond
to,
no
question
about
it
if
that
is
factual
issue.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
do
not
necessarily
want
to,
but
i
am
addressing
myself
to
mr.
justice
stewart
who
said
the
broad
question
should
be
considered
first.
should
the
suit
be
filed,
allowed
to
stand
in
general
under
allegation.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes,
no
question.
in
other
words,
i
am
going
on
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
oh!
no!
not
at
all.
i
am
going
generally
on
the
type
of
analysis
provided
by
learned
hand
in
the
gregoire
versus
biddle
decision
177
f.2d
i
think
at
579,
there
is
a
citation
on
it.
and
certainly
there
is
probably
no
more
revere
to
judge
learned
hand
at
the
circuit
level
and
he
said
that
if
it
were
possible
before
the
trial
to
ascertain
which
suits
had
merit
and
which
did
not.
it
would
be
really
tragedy
to
dismiss
a
suit
that
did
not
in
fact
have
merit
and
i
suggest
that
this
court
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
he
did
say
that,
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
say
that
our
case
comes
within
that
canopy
because
we
have
come
as
close
as
we
could
to
the
situation
with
the
grant
of
the
federal
writ
of
habeas
corpus
because
of
that
particular
issue.
in
other
words,
this
man
has
had
his
preliminary
hearing.
the
reason
that
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
he
said
his
preliminary
hearing
by
virtue
of
this
22
u.s.c.
or
28
u.s.c.
2254,
grant
of
writ
of
habeas
corpus?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well
no,
but
the
record
is
there
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
he
admitted.
he
was
called
as
a
witness
in
this
evidentiary
hearing
and
he
admitted
under
oath
that
he
had
done
these
things.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
the
u.s.
ninth
circuit
said
he
was
not
bound.
i
tried
to
urge
in
the
u.s.
ninth
circuit
the
type
of
res
judicata
by
virtue
of
the
grant
of
the
writ
by
the
district
court.
they
did
not
go
along
with
that
at
all.
however,
the
point
is
simply
that
if
you
have
done
as
extensive
litigation
as
we
have
done
on
this
particular
case,
it
then
gets
around
the
contention
that
they
are
being
required
to
respond
to
a
frivolous
type
of
claim.
it
certainly
is
not
a
frivolous
type
of
claim.
it
is
a
claim
that
has
merit
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
this
was
granted
by
the
u.s.
district
court
and
i
can
only
tell
this
court
that
it
was
granted
because
that
district
judge
at
my
urging
and
on
my
briefing
examined
that
record
with
due
scrutiny
which
was
not
done
in
the
california
supreme
court
or
if
it
was
done,
it
was
ignored.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
do
not
know.
i
am
only
talking
about
this
case,
only
about
this
case
and
this
case
was
not
reversed.
the
u.s.
ninth
circuit
upheld
his
grant
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
as
far
as
i
know
with
no
votes.
so
there
is
no
question
in
my
mind
that
at
least
the
threshold
showing
has
been
made.
now,
in
this
particular
case
as
the
court
perhaps
knows
there
has
been
numerous
contentions
made
that
it
is
going
to
open
the
floodgates
to
litigation
and
i
say
again
there
is
numerous
safety
valves
that
really
militate
against
this
and
i
think
the
first
one
is
that
usually
people,
like
in
the
position
of
mr.
imbler,
are
seeking
substantial
damages.
they
go
to
a
lawyer
and
they
say
i
want
to
do
this.
i
want
to
bring
this
lawsuit.
usually
the
lawyer
is
not
in
the
position
nor
are
they
able
to
pay
an
hourly
rate,
so
it
is
often
done
on
a
contingency
basis.
i,
therefore,
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
any
lawyer
would
probably
scrutinize
himself
the
record.
he
would
try
to
make
inquiries
to
see
if
he
is
chasing
a
comet
that
has
no
merit
at
all,
just
like
a
personal
injury
case
that
comes
in
to
the
office
of
a
lawyer,
he
would
examine
it
with
diligence
to
see
and
i
think
that
there
is
an
immense
safety
valve
to
the
bringing
of
these
lawsuits.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
in
fact
three
times.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
the
first
time,
it
was
on
the
automatic
appeal
which
is
provided
under
our
penal
code
because
a
dissent
was
imposed.
at
that
time,
none
of
this
matter
was
brought
before
them
because
it
was
not
disclosed.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
the
second
opinion
mr.
chief
justice
at
60
cal.
2d
554
was
disclosed
as
a
california
supreme
court
came
to
treating
it
and
it
again
ignored
many
of
the
issues.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
he
did,
the
first
two
opinions.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
think
he
wrote
all
three
opinions.
the
third
opinion
is
at
61
cal.
2d
and
that
came
about
because
of
a
violation
of
a
so-called
people
versus
morris
decision
in
the
california
supreme
court
which
said
that
the
prosecutor
could
not
comment
to
the
jury
that
life
sentence
in
california
really
did
not
mean
a
life
sentence
and
that
if
you
want
to
make
sure
this
fellow
was
not
out
on
the
street
again,
you
better
execute
him
and
they
voted
the
death
penalty
against
mr.
imbler
because
of
this
comment
and
that
case
was
given
retroactivity
by
the
california
supreme
court
and
so
mr.
imbler
was
able
to
take
advantage
of
that,
which
generated
the
third
opinion
in
the
california
supreme
court
and
then
the
prosecutor
elected
not
to
try
the
penalty
phase
over
again
and
stipulated
to
a
life
sentence
as
opposed
to
a
death
sentence.
so
that
was
a
posture
of
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
only
monetary
damages,
that
is
correct
and
in
the
district
court
lawsuit
that
is
correct.
now,
i
think
also,
i
think
alluded
to
this
very
briefly,
that
i
know
that
one
of
the
specters
that
is
hanging
over
an
attempt
that
is
being
made
here
by
the
plaintiff
to
allow
him
to
bring
this
suit
is
that
there
is
going
to
be
felt
that
some
national
precedence
is
going
to
be
set
and
i
would
again
say
to
this
court
that
as
happened
in
this
particular
case,
certain
pre-trial
hearings
can
be
held,
whereby
the
plaintiff
would
be
required
to
make
a
rather
significant
showing
that
he
falls
within
the
canopy
that
i
am
urging
in
this
court
namely,
it
is
something
that
has
to
be
outside
of
the
discretionary
act
of
the
prosecutor
and
ostensibly
made
with
no
good
faith
and
outside
of
his
jurisdiction
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
certainly
it
is
probably
always
a
question
for
the
jury.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
am
mentioning
more
than
that
alone.
i
am
mentioning
whether
it
is
a
discretionary
act
or
not.
certainly
the
bulk
of
these
cases,
i
think
are
correctly
decided
in
granting
immunity
because
the
bulk
of
the
things
that
happened
are
within
the
discretion
of
the
prosecutor.
for
example,
the
metamorphosis
in
the
ninth
circuit
starts
of
with
the
case
that,
after
this
act
was
passed,
starts
of
with
a
case
called
cyrus
versus
cole
i
think
and
cyrus
versus
cole
was
a
suit
versus
not
only
the
prosecutor,
but
also
the
judge
because
the
man
was
convicted
of
calf-stealing
and
he
was
sentenced
for
a
felony
as
opposed
to
a
misdemeanor.
now,
certainly,
that
probably
was
a
mere
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
judge
and
was
correctly
thrown
out
and
that
was
the
1963
case.
the
next
time
the
u.s.
ninth
circuit
examined,
this
was
in
a
case
called
harmon
versus
superior
court
329
f.
2d
154,
there
it
was
a
simple
domestic
relation
squabble
in
state
court.
the
plaintiff
in
the
civil
right
suit
was
disappointed
apparently
after
results
that
took
place
in
his
state
court
domestic
relations
matter
and
he
brought
a
lawsuit
against
the
state's
district
attorney
who
was
seeking
to
make
him
pay
child
support.
again,
i
think
clearly,
properly
thrown
out.
if
something
within
his
discretion
he
was
doing
his
day
to
day
job,
doing
what
he
had
to
do,
but
the
knowing
use
of
perjury
is
not
that
class
of
cases.
it
is
not
that
class
of
thing.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
understand
that
that
is
a
language
that
appears
in
many
of
the
cases.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
that
is
why
am
urging
in
this
court
that
where
there
has
been
extensive
litigation,
culminating
in
a
successful
grant
of
the
writ
by
a
district
judge
upon
examination
as
the
record
as
he
has
to
do
under
townsend
v.
sain,
then
we
are
not
dealing
with
something
that
is
non-substantial.
we
are
not
dealing
with
frivolity.
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
should
be
responded
to.
otherwise,
it
makes
the
decision
of
the
district
attorney,
the
supreme
law
of
the
land,
unreviewable
by
any
court
at
all.
and
this
court,
just
last
term,
in
a
couple
of
cases,
in
the
scheuer
versus
rhodes
decision
allowed
the
suit
against
the
governor
of
ohio.
in
wood
versus
strickland,
a
suit
against
the
school
board.
now,
i
would
suggest
that
the
language
of
scheuer
versus
rhodes
again
deals
with
the
good
faith
discretionary
basis,
that
governor
ordered
out
the
national
guard
in
kent,
ohio
at
that
university
because
he
perceived
he
had
to
do
something
quickly.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
do.
i
think
that
the
so-called
quasi-judicial
immunity
which
creeps
into
the
decisions
is
really
a
misnomer.
surely,
the
attorney
general
of
united
states,
the
attorney
general
of
california,
these
are
officers
that
are
responding
to
the
president
of
united
states
or
the
governor
or
so
forth.
they
are
an
arm
of
the
executive
branch.
there
is
no
question
about
that
and
the
question
or
the
reason
that
this
has
come
into
the
cases
without
a
doubt
is
because
allegedly
a
prosecutor
exercises
the
discretion
just
like
a
judge
does.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
think
he
is
exercising
an
executive
function
as
a
chief
law
officer
of
the
state,
but
to
insulate
one
side
to
a
lawsuit
as
they
are
attempting
to
do
with
the
public
prosecutor
from
review
by
any
type
of
civil
rights
action
by
any
type
of
federal
judge,
i
think
elevates
him
to
a
position
where
his
decision
becomes
above
the
u.s.
constitution.
it
becomes
above
review
by
anybody
and
i
would
also
suggest
that
really
there
are
not
that
many
of
these
suits.
you
can
check
through
all
the
books
and
compare
it
with
a
number
of
other
suits
and
there
are
really
not
that
many.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
do
not
think
so
chief
justice
burger
because
i
think
this
court
can
delineate
certain
guidelines
that
have
to
be
followed
and
i
would
hope
that
they
would
do
so
in
allowing
this
suit
to
stand.
i
think
that
the
court
can
delineate
guidelines
in
the
way
of
some
type
of
preliminary
hearing
were
in
fact
merit
must
be
shown
by
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
think
that
surely,
if
you
could
not
show
that
he
was
behaving
outside
of
a
discretionary
act,
it
would
be
automatically
subjected
to
dismissal,
that
is
one
of
the
issues.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
it
is
a
harder
decision
obviously
than
the
knowing
use
of
perjured
testimony,
a
harder
decision.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
understand,
but
in
this
particular
case,
he
admitted
to
knowing
this,
if
it
pleases
the
court,
he
admitted
to
knowing
the
status
of
this
man
that
he
had
been
committed
to
an
insane
asylum
by
a
court
and
he
said
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
i
decided
to
let
the
jury
attempt
to
do
--
to
figure
it
out
themselves.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
by
ignoring
that
particular
thing
in
its
opinion,
by
ignoring
that.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that
is
correct.
that
opinion
--
if
you
place
before
side
by
side
the
two
opinions
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
u.s.
district
judge,
they
obviously
consider
different
things.
the
u.s.
district
judge
considered
many
more
factors.
now,
certainly
i
do
not
think
my
opponents
are
suggesting
that
that
u.s.
district
judge
falsified
any
material
what
he
put
in
that
opinion.
he
certainly
did
not.
he
quoted
directly
from
transcript
material.
now,
i
of
course
was
not
the
lawyer
before
the
california
supreme
court,
so
i
cannot
say
gee!
you
know,
i
did
a
bad
job
there,
but
i
have
read
all
the
briefs
and
there
is
mountain
of
material
that
goes
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
on
this
case
and
they
just
simply
did
not
get
to
the
merits
of
the
case
like
the
u.s.
district
judge
did.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
just
read
the
opinion.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
have
read
the
briefs
and
some
of
these
materials
were
not
properly
briefed
because
there
are
some
people
that
say,
well,
unless
there
is
actual
overt
perjury
it
is
different
then
the
napue
versus
illinois
situation
where
he
is
required
to
change
or
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
trier
of
the
fact
known
false
statements.
some
people
distinguish
that
in
their
mind.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
that
is
possible.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
i
hope
that
i
do
not
have
to.
i
think
that
considering
the
wood
versus
strickland
analysis
where
this
court
accorded
liability
against
an
arkansas
school
board,
if
you
rely
on
that
type
of
thinking
of
this
court
then
a
fortiori
this
case
ought
to
be
allowed
to
stand.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
no,
i
do
not,
but
i
think
that
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
out
of
this
is
that
a
member
of
the
arkansas
school
board
ostensibly
has
no
training
ground
to
become
a
member
of
the
school
board.
he
may
be
the
local
grocer;
he
may
be
a
postman
or
something.
he
may
serve
on
the
school
board
because
it
is
a
civic
duty.
he
has
probably
very
little
knowledge
about
what
the
civil
rights
of
those
students
are,
but
this
court
said
that
as
to
existing
law
that
is
well
established
in
this
country,
the
school
board
should
be
held
to
know
about
it.
they
are
not
going
to
be
held
to
anticipate
changes
in
constitutional
law,
but
they
are
certainly
going
to
be
held
to
anticipate
what
the
existing
constitutional
law
is
and
certainly
a
fortiori
with
the
law
school
training
of
a
prosecutor
and
he
is
presumed
knowledge
of
the
canons
of
ethics
and
his
presumed
knowledge
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
from
mooney
versus
holohan
and
napue
versus
illinois,
miller
versus
pate,
the
united
states
versus
giglio,
and
the
various
decisions
which
have
uniformly
condemned
this
particular
type
of
behavior.
this
man
surely
is
put
on
knowledge
on
what
he
was
doing
is
not
only
is
wrong
biblically,
but
is
wrong
legally.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that
is
correct.
it
gets
him
out,
but
this
man
did
ten
years
for
this
crime.
four
years
on
death
row,
six
more
in
maximum
security
from
the
period
of
his
life
from
about
39
to
49,
he
spent
all
his
time
while
his
children
grew
up.
he
did
not
see
the
children
except
when
they
may
have
come
to
the
penitentiary.
he
was
within
seven
days
being
executed
on
one
occasion,
within
21
days
being
executed
on
the
second
occasion.
why
should
he
not
be
able
to
get
some
monetary
damages
to
attempt
to
rectify
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that
is
correct,
but
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
he
stands
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
well,
it
is
probably
not
that
easy,
that
is
correct,
not
that
easy,
but
from
my
experience
with
the
prosecutors
of
the
state
of
california
when
they
are
looking
for
a
witness
where
they
have
a
lot
easier
time
to
get
witnesses
than
the
defense
does
and
they
have
a
way
of
resurrecting
these
people.
i
do
not
know
any
of
them
that
have
been
dead
and
if
this
thing
goes
to
back
to
district
court,
i
would
suspect
that
these
people
would
somehow
come
out
of
the
woodworks
to
testify
for
the
respondent
in
this
particular
case.
there
is
little
doubt
in
my
mind
about
that.
i
would
say
that
in
closing
to
this
court
that
at
least
this
court
should
allow
this
case
to
go
to
the
jury.
this
case
should
stand
at
least
by
itself.
if
the
court
does
not
wish
to
allow
the
general
type
of
allegations,
at
least
this
case
where
there
has
been
a
decision
by
united
states
district
judge,
and
affirmed
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
where
cert
has
been
denied
by
this
court
under
the
facts
that
had
been
set
forth
in
that
opinion,
that
satisfies
the
situation
that
he
is
not
being
required
to
respond
to
a
frivolous
type
of
contention.
far
from
it
and
i
would
urge
on
this
court
the
reasoning
of
the
u.s.
sixth
circuit
in
the
hilliard
opinion
that
these
cases
stand
on
their
own.
otherwise,
the
few
times
that
this
happens
is
going
to
place
a
prosecutor
above
review
by
anybody
and
i
think
that
that
not
only
as
an
intellectual
non-sect
order,
but
a
legal
non-sect
order
and
a
tragedy
more
or
less.
in
addition,
there
is
little
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
case
ought
to
stand
and
i
think
that
this
court
ought
to
delineate
some
guidelines
for
it,
allow
it
to
go
to
trial.
and
another
safety
valve,
i
think
is
in
fact
when
it
does
go
to
trial,
maybe
the
plaintiff
may
not
be
able
to
make
out
his
claim.
certainly,
when
the
scheuer
case
went
to
trial
on
ohio,
they
lost,
but
i
think
correctly,
they
were
allowed
to
at
least
stay
in
court
and
make
their
contentions.
this
type
of
thing
certainly
differs
from
scheuer
because
this
man
in
his
decision
to
use
perjury
in
this
case
and
failed
to
correct
it.
he
is
not
faced
with
some
decision
that
he
has
to
exercise
discretion
on
or
where
he
has
to
call
out
a
national
guard
in
order
to
stop
civil
disorder.
he
is
faced
with
something
that
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
i
would
certainly
say
so
justice
white.
now,
they
had
not
done
anything
about
them.
another
contention
often
made
this
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
potentially,
he
would
be.
nothing
has
ever
happened
to
this
man.
he
still
occupies
a
significant
role
in
the
district
attorney’s
office
in
los
angeles.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
yes
sir,
no
question
about
it.
i
think
my
opponent
in
this
brief
has
set
forth
some
statutes
to
set
that
up.
surely,
that
if
the
death
penalty
would
have
been
carried
out
in
this
case,
mr.
pachtman
himself
would
be
subject
to
prosecution
for
murder.
we
have
a
statute
that
provides
that.
had
the
death
penalty
been
carried
out
against
mr.
imbler,
mr.
pachtman
himself
could
be
prosecuted
for
murder
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
little
doubt
about
it.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
you
mean
could
it
be
brought
under
california
law?
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
we
have
a
case
before
the
california
supreme
court
which
is
examining
that
right
now
called
the
horvath
case.
people
were
--
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
not
fully,
although
the
california
tort
claims
act
of
course
does
provide
for
suits
against
officers
of
the
county,
officers
of
the
city
and
so
forth.
however,
i
think
in
that
particular
situation
the
california
tort
claims
act
is
also
given
a
type
of
immunity.
this
would
be
the
first
case
which
opens
that
up.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
but
our
act
provides
that
they
will
respond
in
damages
for
a
successful
suit
against
one
of
the
employees.
mr.
roger
s.
hanson
that
issue
is
going
to
be
decided
by
the
government
supreme
court
program.
