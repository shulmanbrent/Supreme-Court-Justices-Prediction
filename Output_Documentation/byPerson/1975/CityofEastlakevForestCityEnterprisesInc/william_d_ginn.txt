mr.
william
d.
ginn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
there
is
one
thing
that
we
shall
not
do
in
this
case,
is
to
treat
this
issue
which
has
been
presented
by
these
litigants
lightly
or
other
than
a
severe
question
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
my
client
is
a
corporation
form,
but
it
was
ten
immigrant
--
immigrants
from
lithuania
originally
and
we
cherish
the
right
to
vote
and
the
constitutional
protections
just
as
much
as
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
eastlake.
and
your
honors,
we
do
not
have
a
voting
right
case
here
and
we
do
not
really
have
a
referendum
case
and
we
really
do
not
have
a
division
of
powers
case
in
the
sense
of
legislative
administrator.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
in
the
referendum
aspect,
your
honor,
it
does
not
differ.
there
was
a
mandatory
referendum
in
effect
in
valtierra
and
there
is
also
here
a
mandatory
referendum.
the
crucial
difference
in
valtierra
and
there
are
several
differences,
the
first
difference
is
that
valtierra
was
not
a
due
process
case.
as
the
court
recognized,
the
valtierra
case
was
a
situation
where
there
was
no
attempt
to
exercise
the
police
power.
the
issue
was
equal
protection.
it
was
raised
by
a
group
of
persons
interested
in
low
rent
housing,
not
in
individual
property
owner’s
rights
with
respect
to
the
use
of
his
property
and
it
was
not
a
zoning
case.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
the
use
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
the
result
is
that
we
are
left
with
industrial
zoning,
but
with
a
deprivation
of
due
process,
because
your
honor,
the
essential
issue
in
the
case
is
exactly
that
the
due
process
issue
and
i
will
explain
to
the
court
why.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
it
has
to
do,
your
honor,
with
the
process
by
which
our
rights
have
been
decided.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
on
the
use
of
the
property.
we
are
challenging
the
process
by
which
the
city
of
eastlake
seeks
to
grant
or
deny
the
right
to
change
which
is
recognized
in
euclid,
which
is
recognized
in
due
process
cases
generally,
even
in
mcgautha
and
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
precisely,
your
honor.
that
comes
directly
down
to
really
the
vices
and
i
think
these
will
interweave
into
the
questions
that
court
has
been
asking.
the
vice,
if
you
will,
the
shortcomings
of
the
euclid
mandatory
referendum
system.
we
have
a
traditional
referendum
system
and
i
believe
the
court
understands
that,
up
to
the,
i
mean,
the
traditional
zoning
system
and
rezoning
system
up
to
the
point
where
the
council
has
validated
the
request
for
the
change
has
found
that
the
request
for
a
change
is
within
the
public
safety,
morals,
and
general
welfare
of
the
community
and
at
that
point,
it
is
that
the
eastlake
mandatory
zoning
procedure
takes
over
and
we
submit
that
the
effectiveness,
if
you
will,
of
the
legislative
determine
--
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
because
the
planning
commission
only
makes
recommendations,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well,
it
is
not
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
had
that
been
true,
your
honor
and
if
the
people
were
exercising
the
right
to
control
the
use
of
my
property,
then
that
exercise
with
that
right
would
have
to
be
or
would
have
to
arise
to
the
constitutional
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
my
property
and
the
right
to
utilize
it,
is
being
restricted
by
a
system
which
in
the
first
instance
is
not
a
process
which
permits
of
a
reasonable
decision
by
reason
of
the
process.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
have
a
constitutional
system
for
restricting
my
property
rights
under
euclid,
under
mcgautha,
the
decision
on
rezoning,
your
honors,
must
be
arrived
at
in
an
even
handed
manner
on
a
rational
basis
and
not
by
a
process
which
permits
random
choice
or
arbitrary
decision.
that
is
the
standard.
yes
sir,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
i
would
not,
your
honor
because
i
have
no
vested
right
in
the
zoning.
the
zoning,
this
is
the
very
thing
that
precipitated
justice
sterns
concurring
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
below.
the
attempt
to
think
in
terms
of
a
constitutional
zoning
system
as
though
it
is
a
restrictive
covenant
running
with
the
land,
the
right
to
change
of
which
is
a
matter
of
favor,
it
can
be
granted
or
denied,
depending
upon
the
status
of
the
particular
litigant
standing
before
the
people.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well,
you
may
--
we
may
increase
the
size
of
the
vote
in
council,
your
honor.
we
may,
under
a
constitutional
or
a
classic
zoning
system
provide
for
various
procedures
for
change,
but
the
end
result,
the
final
decision
here,
is
a
decision
which
in
effect
is
a
mandatory
referendum
decision.
it
is
one
which
is
not
reviewable
on
any
of
the
basis
which
support
a
due
process
system.
it
is
one
which
cannot
be
referred
to
any
of
the
standards
of
health
safety
or
general
welfare.
under
the
classic
zoning
system,
your
honor,
we
have
a
provision
for
as
it
prescribes
in
euclid
against
the
ambler
realty,
a
provision
for
measuring
whether
the
end
product
has
had
reference
to
the
standards
of
due
process.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
i
would
not
say
it
is
procedural
defect,
your
honor
because
there
the
decision
by
the
real
decision
maker,
the
city
council
arrived
at
through
a
due
process
system
has
determined
that
i
shall
not
get
the
change.
now,
it
may
be
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
in
making
the
people
the
real
decision
maker,
that
is
where
they
have
created
the
conflict
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
the
--
yes,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
think
the
question,
the
issue
mr.
justice
blackmun,
in
that
circumstance
would
be
whether
the
town
meeting
as
a
part
of
the
process
for
rezoning
had
a
sufficient
procedural
protection
to
it,
so
that
we
could
ascertain
whether
the
standards
of
due
process
were
being
applied
by
the
decision
maker
so
that
we
could
examine
into
the
basis
of
that
decision
through
some
legitimate
judicial
process.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
think
in
the
sense
what
you
are
referring
to,
your
honor,
is
that
what
does
take
place
in
a
lot
of
zoning,
even
in
eastlake
and
that
is
that
there
are
public
hearings.
now,
the
town
meeting
may
--
i
do
not
know
whether
the
town
meeting
actually
decides
in
the
sense
of
a
town
council
deciding,
but
as
long
as
the
constitutional
processes
are
present,
then
we
can
have
a
valid
zoning
system.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well,
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
right,
or
to
the
litigant.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well,
under
those
circum
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
yes.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well,
no
i
would
say
there
maybe
deficiencies
in
the
due
process
procedure
under
which
that
decision
has
been
arrived
at
and
those
deficiencies
maybe
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
local
community
at
large
or
there
maybe
a
matter
of
concern
to
the
property
owner.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
that
there
is
no
public
hearing
and
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
but
we
had
no
consideration,
your
honor
in,
you
know,
before
the
public.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it
is
quite
well
established
that
in
that
type
of
referendum
that
you
have
spoken
of,
that
there
may
not
be
a
constitutional
infirmity.
the
kind
of
referendum
so
called
that
we
are
speaking
of
is
a
show
of
hands
by
the
people
on
whether
my
individual
property
shall
be
restricted
by
a
zoning
ordinance
or
by
a
change.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
appropriate
to
say
have
the
restriction
lifted.
the
eastlake
ordinance
as
many,
as
indeed
all
of
these
ordinances,
as
the
ambler,
euclid
against
ambler
realty
case
itself
said,
there
must
be
a
function
of
change
under
these.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
correct.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
yes,
your
honor
it
is
and
zoning
is
itself
a
rather
unique
and
as
the
court
has
observed,
members
of
the
court
previously,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
most
recently
in
valtierra
that
zoning
is
a
matter
which
does
impinge
directly
on
individual
property
rights.
and
zoning
has
his
historically,
been
treated
as
a
adjudicatory
type,
whether
we
put
the
labels
on
it
or
not,
if
the
request
of
the
individual
that
he
has
the
benefits
of
the
change
that
the
zoning
ordinances
provide
as
available
to
the
community
and
have
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
your
honor.
we
are
individual
property
owner,
that
is
true.
we
are
just
an
individual
property
owner
and
the
issue
is
whether
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
measured
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
william
d.
ginn
it
is
something
else,
it
is
something
else.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
it
can
be
controlled
by
a
referendum
of
the
traditional
variety
if
the
--
or
at
least
it
is
arguable
that
it
can
be.
in
this
particular
instance,
we
do
not
have
that
kind
of
a
referendum.
we
have
a
show
of
hands
which
masquerades
as
a
referendum.
it
has
been
labeled
as
a
referendum.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
you
can
put
your
side
in
before
the
people,
your
honor,
but
let
us
examine
that
because
i
think
that
is
--
due
process
is
a
matter
of
the
burdens
of
course
that
a
society
places
on
the
individual
and
in
the
case
of
a
mandatory
referendum,
the
burden
is
placed
on
the
homeowner,
not
only
of
carrying
the
initial
burden,
that
is
of
going
to
planning
commission,
the
public
hearing
and
the
council
and
having
his
request
for
a
change
validated
as
being
within
the
public
welfare.
now,
the
individual
property
owner
is
given
an
additional
burden
and
that
additional
burden
is
to
act
in
affect
as
the
private
attorney
general
for
the
public
officials
seeking
to
validate
their
judgment.
now,
with
respect
to
my
use
of
property
that
is
whether
or
not
my
use
fits
the
general
welfare
and
in
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well,
i
am
conscripted
into
that
position,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
we
wanted
to
build
some
conventional
housing
on
a
piece
of
industrial
property
that
was
rezoned
for
that
purpose
after
public
hearing
by
the
council
upon
recommendation
of
the
planning
and
zoning
commission.
and
then,
by
throwing
it
open
to
a
show
of
hands
to
the
personal
preference,
if
you
will,
your
honor,
are
the
people
who
happened
to
come
down
to
the
poles
on
that
day,
by
throwing
it
open
to
show
of
hands,
we
were
denied
that
which
the
duly
constituted
authorities
under
the
classic
rezoning
situation
had
granted
to
us.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
william
d.
ginn
it
was
put
on
the
ballot
under
this
mandatory
referendum.
it
was
put
on
the
ballot
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
they
cannot
take
my
rights
away
in
a
fashion
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
they
do,
your
honor,
occasionally
and
then
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
they
cannot
change
it
in
such
a
way
is
to
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
yes,
if
they
did
it
within.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
if
they
change
mine
in
accordance
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
your
honor,
i
have
no
complaint.
but
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
yes,
they
make
a
law
of
general
applicability.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
under
those
circumstances,
the
issue
would
be
whether
the
time
for
which
the
in
effect
policy
was
in
effect
was
the
reasonable
one,
if
the
people
or
if
their
legislative
authorities
or
by
charter
amendment
had
said
there
shall
be
no
changes,
in
the
zoning
laws
that
under
euclid
against
amber
realty
would
be
unconstitutional,
i
would
contend.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
that
is
the
matter
of
the
burden
of
restrictions
on
my
property
because
the
very
essence
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
it
is
so
unreasonable
as
to
be
unlawful.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
as
directive
against
my
property.
you
are
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
you
are
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
we
are
attacking
the
method
and
means
whereby
zoning
is
opposed
and
denied
under
the
eastlake
charter.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
the
answer
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
that
would
likely
be
reasonable
and
likely
be
constitutional
because
of
the
reasonableness
of
it,
if
the
five
years
was
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no
it
does
not.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
think
the
method
and
procedure
there
is
inconsequential.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well,
it
was
clearly
under
the
briefs
while
they
just
indicated
the
denial
than
that
under
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
it
was
clearly
directed
to
our
individual
property.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
and
the
brief
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
we
do
not
rely
upon
it,
your
honor.
the
deprivation
of
due
process
by
this
system
is
so
fundamental
that
we
would
not
rely
upon
it
as
being
--
as
the
key
being
the
fact
that
it
was
directed
to
us.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
your
honor.
the
55%
as
such
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
yes,
your
honor
and
it
is
noted
in
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
the
question
of
conditional
zoning
is
another
issue.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
in
this,
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument,
your
honor
because
the
fact
is,
that
we
cannot
examine
into
the
basis
for
the
decision
that
is
made
by
the
electorate
on
my
property
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
that
is
the
effect
(voice
overlap).
that
is
the
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
my
real
complaint
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
pursuant
to
a
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
by
this
procedure,
i
cannot
be
denied
and
that
is
for
sure.
your
honor,
the
procedure
is
deficient
in
at
least
three
major
ways.
the
first
two
are
interrelated.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
yes,
your
honor
because
in
the
first
place
they
have
put
that
burden
on
me
of
expanding
my
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
i
have
no
distrust
to
the
voters
as
the
fundamental
matter,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no.
i
say
that
the
decision
of
the
voters
cannot
be
as
they
have
conceded,
cannot
be
examined
into.
there
is
no
way
in
which
i
can
test
the
basis
on
which
--
it
may
be
personal
preference,
it
maybe
bias
and
prejudice,
who
knows?
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
on
my
individual
property,
i
cannot
accept
the
fact
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
a
mere
show
of
hands,
that
is
without
any
reference
and
this
is
important
mr.
justice
white,
without
reference
to
standards
because
that
was
the
key
of
euclid
against
ambler
realty,
the
people
have
no
way.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
process
in
that
sense,
i
would
be,
your
honor
because
the
decision
of
the
people
on
the
use
of
my
property
once
having
been
validated
as
within
the
public
welfare,
now
the
people
are
asked
by
a
show
of
hands
to
determine
do
i
get
what
i
have
gotten
from
the
legislative
authorities
and
through
the
normal
processes
or
do
i
not
and
there
is
no
way,
in
which
i
could
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
should
say
the
constitutional
process,
your
honor,
because
and
i
want
to
answer
that
directly
because,
the
contention
that
the
petitioner
makes
is
that
the
end
result,
that
is
the
people’s
votes,
is
the
only
thing
that
matters
and
how
we
get
to
that
end
result
is
inconsequential
and
cannot
be
attacked.
i
say,
that
under
our
constitution,
it
is
process,
it
is
how
we
structure
the
system
that
does
the
whole
job
and
the
fact
that
in
a
particular
instance
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
your
honor,
in
a
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
one
is
the
lack
of
any
ability
to
refer
to
the
standards
in
terms
or
to
measure
the
standards
in
terms
of
the
mandatory
referendum.
the
mandatory
referendum
is
not
susceptible
to
being
measured
by
the
standards.
the
second
one,
your
honor,
is
really
the
first
one
and
that
is
that
we
cannot
have
a
constitutional
system
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
where
there
is
purely
at
random
or
arbitrary
result
unless
the
system
itself
is
susceptible
of
a
reasonable,
rational
even
handed
approach
and
mandatory
referendum
is
simply
random.
it
depends
upon
the
content
of
the
information
in
the
minds
of
the
voters
as
they
approach
the
polls
on
that
very
day.
it
depends
upon
who
happens
to
show
up.
it
depends
upon
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
true,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
it
is
true.
it
is
plenty
of
them.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
necessarily
means
that,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
think
that
that
what
we
mean,
is
that
when
we
have
a
system
which
is
designed
to
grant
or
deny
my
use
or
restrict
my
use
of
private
property
that
it
has
to
be
shrouded
with
at
least
the
protections
of
being
a
system
that
can
be
referred
to
standards
that
it
can
be
reasonable
and
not
random
arbitrary,
capricious,
eubank,
roberge
and
euclid
itself
and
thirdly,
mr.
justice
stevens,
the
system
itself
must
be
one
that
where
you
can
examine
judicially
into
the
basis
for
the
final
decision
that
has
been
made
and
there
is
no
way
as
they
concede
that
you
can
examine
judicially
into
the
basis
of
the
determination
that
has
been
made
at
the
ballot
box
on
this
mandatory
referendum.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
do
not
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
may
i
speak
to
that,
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
do
not
have
to
explain
a
way
eubank
or
roberge,
they
are
in
the
line
of
my
authority.
cusack
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
and
they
allow.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
in
the
case
of
roberge,
your
honor,
there
was
a
duly
validated
opportunity
to
build
a
home
for
the
aged
and
that
final
decision
just
as
in
the
city
of
eastlake
was
suspended
or
made
ineffective
until
there
was
a
vote.
it
is
directly
on
point.
cusack,
your
honor,
involved
an
offensive
use
that
is
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
signboards,
billboards
which
were
classified
under
their
ordinances
as
an
offensive
use,
of
public
nuisance
and
that
public
nuisance
could
be
lifted
by
the
discreet
group
of
persons
who
were
directly
affected
by
it,
and
that
was
held
to
be
constitutional
and
that
is
not
--
it
does
not
have
bearing
on
our
particular
situation.
the
eastlake’s
scheme,
your
honors,
for
a
ballot
box
rezoning
really
presents
this
issue.
do
the
people
have
the
right
by
a
show
of
hands
by
their
mere
expression
of
personal
preferences
to
override
an
individual
property
owner's
fully
validated
right
to
use
his
property
in
a
way
which
is
in
keeping
with
the
public
welfare.
and
if
this
becomes
the
law
of
the
land,
then
we
will
have
taken
a
giant
step
towards
the
destruction
of
due
process
of
law
in
the
area
of
land
use.
this
concept
that
has
been
so
vital
to
the
development
of
land
use
law
of
a
rational
planning
system,
a
decision
that
is
reasonably
arrived
at,
objectively
reached,
this
is
the
essence
of
euclid.
it
is
the
essence
of
mcgautha’s
discussion
of
due
process.
that
kind
of
a
system
will
no
longer
have
any
significance.
fifty
years
of
experience,
your
honors,
in
arriving
at
that
delicate
balance
between
the
community
interest
and
the
individual
property
owners'
interest
will
be
jettisoned
in
favor
of
the
vagaries
of
the
ballot
box
and
we
respectfully
urge
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
consider
that
to
be
an
additional
burden.
that
is
a
hallmark
in
effect
of
the
distinction
between
traditional
referendum
and
this
mandatory
referendum
scheme.
there
is
a
distinction
which
can
be
made.
this
court
could
constitutionally
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
traditional
referendum
has
a
sufficient
group
of
protections
attached
to
it,
that
it
ought
to
be
upheld
whereas
the
mandatory
referendum
with
no
guide
post,
with
no
standards
and
with
just
a
random
result,
ought
not
to
be
upheld
constitutionally.
yes,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
that
would
be
another
issue
and
i
would
have
to
test
then
the
reasonableness
of
the
action
of
the
legislative
body
in
terms
of
--
it
would
not
be
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
at
least,
the
action
of
the
mayor
is
one
that
could
be
inquired
into.
i
think
if
the
system
provides
for
legislative
vetoes
and
we
assume
that
this
is
a
legislative
act,
then
the
issue
would
be
a
slightly
different
one.
it
would
be
the
reasonableness
of
the
act
of
veto
in
my
property
interest
or
my
result.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
pardon,
me
your
honor?
mr.
william
d.
ginn
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
we
would
welcome
the
system
that
gives
us
an
opportunity
to
examine
into
the
rightness,
the
wrongness,
the
reasonableness
of
what
is
done
in
that
respect.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
the
way
you
get
at
the
review
of
council
action,
your
honor,
is
by
going
to
the
courts.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
you
go
to
common
pleas
court.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
claiming
that
there
had
been
an
improper
application
of
the
standards
of
public
health
safety
and
general
welfare
under
euclid,
putting
in
all
of
the
zoning
type
testimony
and
evidence
that
you
would
put
in
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
not
now,
your
honor,
because
the
ultimate
decision
maker
--
i
mean,
we
have
the
presumption
attached
to
the
validity
now
of
what
the
council
has
done,
but
the
ultimate
decision
maker
is
no
longer
challengeable,
we
never
get
the
opportunity.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
because,
your
honor,
you
cannot
delve
into
the
minds
of
the
voters
according
to
the
petitioner.
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
think
the
issue
there
would
be
slightly
different,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
think
the
issue
would
be
whether
or
not
the
use
of
your
property
as
it
has
been
circumscribed
is
an
invalid
use
because
unreasonable
and
contrary
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
would
be
the
traditional
euclid
against
ambler
realty
type.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
it
would
not
be
the
same
issue
in
the
case
of
the
council
action
because
there
we
would
be
seeking
to
have
overwritten
the
judgment
of
the
council
denying
our
right
and
we
would
be
seeking
to
have
the
court,
you
know,
grant
us
the
rezoning.
now,
in
that
circumstance
we
would
not
be
heard
and
we
would
not
be
held
by
the
presumptions
that
normally
attached
to
the
legislative
process
and
we
would
have
a
real
uphill
battle.
but
in
this
circumstance,
in
which
we
were
now
placed,
we
do
not
--
we
had
a
valid
exercise
of
legislative
power
over
the
rezoning.
we
have
been
accorded
the
rezoning.
now,
it
has
been
put
to
the
ballot
box
and
personal
preference
has
said
no
–
mr.
william
d.
ginn
no,
we
cannot
get
the
same
review,
your
honor
because
we
cannot
force
the
people.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
i
do
not
think
the
case
is
the
same,
your
honor
because
the
issue
is
no
longer
whether
the
presumption
of
validity
attached
is
to
the
legislative
process
by
which
we
have
gotten
the
change.
that
presumption
has
been
wiped
out
by
the
show
of
hands
at
the
end
of
a
line
and
so
we
are
--
mr.
william
d.
ginn
there
is,
your
honor,
a
presumption.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
well,
that
your
honor
then
as
a
presumption
of
validity
which
we
cannot
surmount
and
which
we
ought
not
to
have
placed
upon
us
as
a
burden
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
william
d.
ginn
we
would
certainly
attempt
that.
i
think
the
burdens
and
the
whole
process
would
be
different
because
we
are
not
able
to
examine
as
euclid
against
ambler
realty,
as
mcgautha,
as
like
other
decisions
of
this
court
have
said,
in
order
to
have
a
due
process
system,
at
the
end
of
the
line
judicial
review
must
be
available
in
a
reasonable
manner
which
enables
the
person
who
has
been
deprived
of
his
rights
to
examine
into
the
basis
of
the
decision
and
we
are
deprived
of
that
under
this
system.
thank
you,
your
honors.
