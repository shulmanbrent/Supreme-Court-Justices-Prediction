mr.
sam
e.
haddon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
consolidated
appeals
arise
out
of
final
judgment
of
a
three-judge
court
of
the
district
of
montana
in
two
companion
cases.
both
actions
were
filed
by
the
confederated
tribes
of
the
flathead
reservation
and
certain
individual
tribal
members
against
the
state
of
montana
and
certain
of
its
public
officials
seeking
in
the
so-called
cigarette
case
to
enjoin
the
state
from
requiring
a
cigarette
dealer’s
license
tax
for
indian
retailers
and
to
enjoin
the
pre-collection
of
state
cigarette
taxes
on
cigarettes
which
were
sold
by
these
indian
retail
dealers.
the
other
case,
the
personal
property
tax
sought
to
enjoin
the
state
from
the
collection
of
personal
property
taxes
on
property
owned
by
tribal
members
residing
within
the
flathead
reservation.
the
three-judge
court
was
convened
under
28
u.s.c.
2284
and
the
court
by
divided
vote.
judge
smith
dissenting
in
both
cases
held
that
that
the
montana
cigarette
tax,
the
excise
tax
on
dealers
and
on
the
sale
of
cigarettes
themselves
were
in
part
invalid
and
then
final
injunction
was
entered
against
the
state
of
montana
prohibiting
the
state
from
requiring
a
cigarette
dealers
license
tax
of
the
dealers
on
the
reservation,
and
also
enjoining
the
state
of
montana
from
collecting
the
tax
on
sales
of
cigarettes
to
indians.
the
court
in
the
cigarette
tax
case
also
ruled
that
the
state
of
montana
could
require
the
pre-collection
of
the
tax
on
sales
of
cigarettes
made
to
non-indians.
in
the
personal
property
tax
case,
the
collection
of
personal
property
taxes
from
individual
indian
residents
of
the
flathead
reservation
was
enjoined.
the
state
by
these
consolidated
appeals
has
appealed
from
the
portion
of
the
judgment
in
both
cases
which
enjoins
the
collection
on
the
one
hand
of
the
cigarette
tax
and
on
the
other
the
personnel
property
tax.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
the
tax
is
paid
at
one
time,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
but
there
is
both
a
personal
property
tax
on
the
vehicle
itself
and
a
separate
fee
for
registration
of
the
vehicle.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
no,
the
district
court
did
not,
the
tribes
and
the
individual
members
of
the
tribe
who
were
acting
as
plaintiffs
had
indicated
their
willingness
to
pay
the
registration
fee
not
the
tax.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
that
fee
is
not
an
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
primarily
upon
automobiles
but
also
other
types
of
personal
property,
cattle,
farm
equipment,
items
of
that
sort
which
are
classified
under
montana
law
as
personal
property.
these
appeals
raise
the
core
issue
to
which
this
argument
will
be
principally
addressed
of
whether
the
immunity
from
state
taxation
in
favor
of
indian
citizens
on
the
flathead
reservation
are
found
by
the
district
court
to
be
available
and
this
additional
immunity
from
state
taxation
which
the
tribes
and
their
members
seek
with
regard
to
sales
of
cigarettes
to
non-indians.
whether
this
immunity
in
its
entirety
in
invalid
and
unconstitutional
under
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
concepts
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
flathead
reservation
in
northwestern
montana
and
from
which
these
cases
arise
is
a
unique
geographical
area.
and
as
an
indian
reservation
and
as
a
part
of
montana
it
is
unique.
in
order
to
appreciate
the
factual
concept,
i
would
like
to
go
in
some
detail
to
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
case.
the
flathead
reservation
is
approximately
1,250,000
acres.
it
comprises
four
parts
of
montana
counties.
polson,
one
of
the
county
seats
of
montana
is
located
entirely
within
the
confines
of
the
reservation.
it
was
created
by
the
treaty
of
hellgate
in
1855
from
lands
which
were
a
part
of
the
then
washington
territory
and
which
of
course
later
became
the
state
of
montana.
in
1904,
congress
enacted
legislation
which
opened
the
reservation
for
allotment
to
individual
indians
and
for
sale
of
surplus
un-allotted
lands
to
non-indians.
as
a
result
of
this
opening
of
the
reservation,
something
over
400,000
acres
were
sold
to
non-indians.
an
additional
60,000
acres
was
granted
to
the
state
of
montana
for
school
purposes.
other
acreages
were
passed
to
religious
institutions,
to
school
and
others.
so
at
the
present
time
the
mix
on
the
reservation
and
so
far
as
land
ownership
is
concerned,
is
that
over
one-half
of
the
land
on
the
reservation
is
held
in
fee
principally
by
non-indian
owners.
the
balance
of
the
reservation
property
something
slightly
less
than
one-half
is
held
in
part
by
individual
indians
in
trust
title
and
in
part
of
the
tribes
in
tribal
status.
the
tribal
lands
as
the
record
shows
are
being
principally
located
and
sparsely
populated,
foothill
and
mountain
areas.
the
flathead
reservation
at
the
present
time
is
a
well-developed
agricultural
area.
it
is
an
area
with
farms,
ranches,
communities
scattered
all
over
its
inhabited
parts.
it
has
an
elaborate
irrigation
system
which
serves
the
farm
and
ranching
communities
and
farming
ranching
areas
which
was
created
under
congressional
action
in
part
and
by
use
of
state
law
and
through
use
of
the
state
courts
of
the
state
of
montana.
and
it
is
not
and
we
think
it
is
important,
a
place
where
indian
lives
or
indians
live
alone
or
in
isolation,
they
are
scattered
randomly
throughout
the
reservation.
they
live
in
integrated
communities.
they
participate
in
all
of
indian
or
all
of
community
activities
and
service.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
there
is
no
issue
on
this
appeal
as
to
the
continuation
of
the
status
of
the
reservation.
there
are
approximately
18,000
people
who
live
within
the
confines
of
this
reservation.
less
than
20%
of
whom
are
classified
as
indians.
the
indians
themselves
are
ethnically
mixed
group
of
individuals.
something
over
4,000
are
less
than
one-half
indian
blood.
some
are
small
as
1/16
indian
blood.
families
themselves
are
mixed
with
one
parent
or
one
of
the
members
of
the
family
being
an
indian
or
an
enrolled
tribal
member,
the
other
not
being
so.
in
some
instances,
children
of
a
particular
family
are
in
part
tribal
members
and
in
part
non-tribal
members.
it
remains
however
that
the
only
way
that
one
can
claim
status
as
an
indian
is
to
be
born
as
such
within
a
requisite
amount
of
indian
blood.
the
indian
citizen
on
the
flathead
reservation
participates
in
all
facets
of
community
life.
they
vote.
they
hold
office.
they
have
access
to
the
court.
they
attend
schools
provided
by
the
state
of
montana.
in
short,
they
are
totally
integrated
into
the
society
of
the
area
and
they
all
participate
in
all
aspects
of
citizen
life
of
the
state
of
montana.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
sorry.
the
tribes
themselves
lease
land
to
the
individual
indian
plaintiffs
where
the
smoke
shops
were
erected
and
took
action
to
file
the
instant
case
after
the
state
of
montana
attempted
to
preclude
the
sale
of
the
cigarettes
without
tax
stamps
affixed.
the
personal
property
tax
suit
was
likewise
instituted
following
refusal
of
the
state
of
montana
to
omit
the
indian
citizens
from
payment
of
the
tax.
we
suggest
that
the
approach
which
is
taken
by
the
tribes
and
by
the
individual
indian
citizens
in
this
case
seeks
to
draw
what
amounts
to
a
line
around
a
portion
of
the
state
of
montana.
and
to
say
that
if
a
particular
individual
citizen
of
the
state
is
a
member
of
a
particular
ethnic
or
racial
groups
that
is
an
indian
and
that
if
he
resides
within
that
area,
then
he
must
not
pay
taxes
to
the
sate
of
montana.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
the
line,
of
course
your
honor
is
the
direct
result
of
the
establishment
of
the
confines
of
the
flathead
indian
reservation
by
the
treaty
of
hellgate
in1855.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
indeed,
it
is
not
as
it
existed
for
over
100
years.
our
position
is
not
with
standing
the
existence
of
the
flathead
reservation
is
that
this
treatment
of
indian
citizens
for
tax
purposes
differently
form
other
citizens
of
the
state
of
montana
cannot
be
carried
into
practice
without
creating
a
conflict
between
the
requirements
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
particular
practice.
the
practice
as
we
see
it
allows
the
indian
citizen
to
have
and
to
continue
to
receive
all
of
the
benefits
of
citizenship
of
the
state
and
yet
not
be
responsible
for
the
fair
share
of
burdens
of
that
citizenship.
we
suggest
that
this
court
has
already
considered
the
question
of
benefits
versus
burdens
or
benefits
and
burdens
as
a
part
of
role
of
citizenship
in
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case
and
the
facts
are
not
unlike
the
facts
which
are
before
the
court
in
this
case
and
there
the
court
noted
that
tax
exemptions
were
not
to
be
granted
by
implication
and
that
the
tax
which
was
sought
to
be
imposed
by
the
state
of
oklahoma
was
valid.
we
suggest
that
the
reasoning
and
analysis
found
to
be
applicable
in
that
case
is
equally
applicable
to
the
case
at
bar.
we
suggest
that
constitutional
issues
aside
that
the
facts
of
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case
are
better
suited,
are
fit
more
precisely
with
the
facts
of
the
case
at
bar
than
under
the
facts
in
mcclanahan.
in
mcclanahan
there
was
little
interaction
between
the
indian
community
and
the
non-indian
community.
the
navajos
lived
apart
on
a
separate
reservation.
there
was
by
williams
versus
lee,
no
state
responsibility
toward
those
indian
citizens
although
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
mcclanahan
indicates
that
there
was
some
extension
of
state
services
and
some
state
responsibilities
toward
those
indian
residents
of
the
flathead,
of
the
navajo
reservation.
in
mcclanahan,
there
was
no
opening
of
the
reservation
to
ownership
of
land
by
non-indians
and
no
general
occupancy
of
that
area
by
non-indians.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
matter
is
in
fact
two-fold.
that
on
the
one
hand
--
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
i
acknowledge
that.
i
am
unaware
of
any
case
prior
to
this
case
in
which
this
particular
argument
has
been
advanced.
we
feel
as
was
found
by
judge
smith
in
his
dissent
that
if
this
program
is
carried
into
effect
that
it
has
the
ultimate
result
of
relieving
one
racial
class
of
a
burden
of
citizenship,
namely
taxation
which
we
suggest
is
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
is
mandated
by
the
united
states
and
that
on
the
other
hand
imposes
upon
another
class
of
citizens
namely
the
non-indian
citizens
of
the
state
of
montana,
an
obligation
to
provide
services
to
those
who
are
exempt
from
the
taxation.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
was
that
he
did
not.
there
is
a
dealers
license
tax
that
is
required
of
the
state
of
montana
or
by
the
state
of
montana.
one
of
the
issues
determined
by
the
lower
court
was
that
that
dealers
license
tax
did
not
have
to
be
paid
by
the
individual
indian
dealers.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
it
is
a
different
kind
of
tax
and
is
imposed
upon
a
different
individual,
your
honor?
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
yes,
it
is.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
it
is
a
criminal
offense
to
buy
untaxed
paid
cigarettes.
i
am
unaware
of
a
criminal
offense
directly
related
to
the
license
tax
itself
with
the
dealer.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
we
certainly
do
your
honor
and
we
feel
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
to
the
extent
that
it
upheld
the
position
of
the
state
of
montana
that
the
tax
could
be
pre-collected
from
non-indian
purchasers
is
entirely
valid
because
to
rule
to
the
contrary
would
have
been
an
invitation
for
all
of
those
non-indian
purchasers
of
cigarettes
to
violate
the
law.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
another
factor
of
some
importance
in
connection
with
this
appeal
while
not
directly
related
to
the
issue
of
constitutional
due
process
and
equal
protection.
is
the
application
of
the
general
allotment
act
to
the
flathead
reservation?
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
yes,
the
record
shows
that
the
flathead
reservation
was
open
for
settlement.
i
beg
your
pardon,
opened
for
allotment
of
individual
indians
in
severalty
under
the
provisions
of
the
general
allotment
act.
and
that
general
allotment
act
by
its
specific
terms
recites
that
upon
expiration
of
the
trust
patent
period,
the
individual
indian
patentee
is
to
be
considered
as
a
citizen
of
the
state
and
to
be
entitled
to
all
of
the
benefits
of
state
citizenship
and
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
state.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
no,
it
was
not
your
honor.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
1904.
i
think
there
is
no
significance
other
than
the
fact
that
reservation
was
not
open
for
general
allotment
prior
to
1904.
we
suggest
that
the
specific
language
of
the
general
allotment
act
is
consistent
with
the
position
found
by
this
court
in
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case.
that
the
burdens
of
citizenship
go
with
the
benefits
of
state
citizenship
and
there
are
on
the
flathead
reservation
at
this
time,
as
the
record
will
show,
individual
indian
citizens
who
received
patents
under
the
terms
of
the
general
allotment
act.
and
if
this
court
should
uphold
the
position
of
the
lower
court
we
suggest
that
it
creates
a
very
anomalous
situation
that
the
general
allotment
act
having
been
intended
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
individual
indian
patentee
and
having
said
that
that
indian
patentee
is
to
be
protected
until
such
time
as
the
patent
trust
expires.
that
if
that
individual
by
the
language
of
the
act
to
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
state
and
no
others
are
to
be
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
state
then
those
who
have
not
received
patents
are
those
who
benefit
from
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
we
suggest
that
the
issue
which
we
present
here
has
not
been
presented
in
any
case
prior
to
this
one.
the
case
of
morton
versus
mancari
which
considered
the
particular
and
unique
relationship
of
the
members
of
recognized
indian
tribes
in
their
employment
with
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
does
not,
we
think
reads
the
issue
before
this
court.
we
would
point
out
that
the
court
in
morton
versus
mancari
was
concerned
about
whether
or
not
a
general
rule
could
be
laid
down
that
would
apply
a
special
kind
of
exemption
for
indians
in
all
matters
of
civil
service
employment
and
we
think
that
sets
the
tone
and
pattern
for
the
issue
here.
that
while
that
particular
case
was
justifiable
on
its
facts
because
of
the
unique
relationship
of
the
federal
government
to
indians
through
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
that
its
concepts
and
precepts
cannot
be
applied
to
the
facts
of
the
case
at
bar.
we
feel
that
there
is
in
reality,
no
true
conflict
between
the
general
regulatory
provisions
of
article
1
section
8
clause
3
and
the
position
which
we
assert
here.
congress
remains,
we
suggest
free
to
do
whatever
it
deems
necessary
in
carrying
out
it
practices
and
policies
with
regard
to
indian
citizens.
in
particular,
it
can
continue
to
control
the
disposition
and
use
of
indian
lands
but
the
rights
to
which
we
speak
rest
on
a
different
level
and
we
think
that
no
additional
congressional
action
is
necessary
to
make
these
rights
operative
as
we
feel
they
should
be.
the
rights
if
they
exists,
the
state,
we
suggest
do
all
that
is
necessary
to
carry
those
rights
into
implementation
including
exercise
of
whatever
jurisdiction
is
necessary
to
ensure
collection
of
the
taxes.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
yes.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
our
basic
position
mr.
justice
white
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
particular
personal
property
is
used
on
the
reservation
entirely
--.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
we
suggest
that
that
is
not
the
same
proposition.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
yes.
we
feel
that
the
unique
status
of
the
military
and
the
role
that
it
plays
is
not
the
same
as
that
of
a
citizen
of
this
country
who
except
for
the
fact
that
he
is
an
indian,
is
no
different
from
any
other
citizens.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
correct.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
even
though
if
it
were
use
there
only.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
we
have
cited
all
the
authority
that
we
have
and
we
have
no
case
specifically
in
point
on
that
subject
obviously.
we
feel
that
the
position
that
we
assert
here
is
that
the
case
is
more
basic
because
of
the
considerations
of
due
process
and
equal
protection
than
any
of
the
precedent
hereto
involved.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
subject
--
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
that
is
correct.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
that
is
correct.
to
elaborate
very
briefly
on
one
of
the
questions
that
you
ask
mr.
justice
white,
one
of
the
problems
as
we
view
it
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
ruled
in
the
cigarette
tax
case
that
the
state
of
montana
could
not
collect
the
tax
from
anyone
who
was
classified
as
an
indian.
that
term
remains
undefined.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
that
is
the
effect
as
we
read
the
lower
court’s
decision.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
that
is
our
understanding
of
the
lower
courts
decision.
it
is
one
of
the
matters
specifically
to
which
judge
smith's
dissenting
opinion
is
addressed.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
like,
all
advocates,
perhaps
mr.
justice
stevens
we
like
to
have
a
position
to
fall
back
to.
our
basic
position
is
that
it
makes
no
difference,
if
a
citizen
is
a
citizen
it
makes
no
difference
what
his
race
is
nor
where
he
lives
he
has
the
same
obligations
as
any
other
citizen.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
the
position
to
which
we
fall
back
is
that
if
the
court
should
deem
it
appropriate
to
accept
that
interpretation
of
the
law,
that
we
have
in
this
particular
case,
a
unique
set
of
factual
circumstances
akin
to
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
case
which
dictate
the
application
of
the
rule
of
that
case
rather
than
the
application
the
rule
of
mcclanahan.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
as
i
read
the
rule
of
mcclanahan
--
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
that
the
individual
indian
citizen
residents
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
where
subject
to
in
that
instance
an
inheritance
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
oklahoma.
the
court
being
concerned
with
and
pointing
to
the
fact
that
they
were
essentially
amalgamated
into
the
oklahoma
society
and
were
citizens
in
all
respects
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
that
being
distinguishable
from
the
situation
in
mcclanahan
where
the
court
points
out
that
the
individual
navajo
resident
of
the
navajo
reservation
lives
largely
a
part
and
without
influence
by
our
responsibility
to
or
from
the
state
of
arizona.
mr.
sam
e.
haddon
thank
you
very
much.
