mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
a
position
of
respondent
i
would
like
to
reply
to
some
of
the
points
made
by
mr.
evans
during
his
argument.
first,
i
think
a
brief
statement
as
to
what
happens
at
the
checkpoint
again
is
in
order.
last
year,
mr.
evans
and
i
disagreed
on
this
point
and
we
disagree
again.
i
think
if
one
looks
at
the
photograph
provided
by
the
government
in
the
reply
brief
to
ortiz
you
can
see
what
the
on
coming
traffic
faces
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
that
is
two
armed
law
enforcement
officers
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
highway
in
front
of
stop
sign
which
says
clearly
stop
and
overhead
there
are
two
additional
signs
saying
stop.
this
is
what
is
called
the
primary
stop,
what
the
baca
court
said
was
the
fleeting
stop
and
it
is
this
where
the
officer
without
any
guideline
regulation
or
rule
makes
a
decision
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
let
that
individual
whom
he
stopped
and
cease
momentarily
pass
on
his
passage
northward
or
to
be
referred
to
the
secondary
area
for
the
interrogation
as
to
the
right
of
the
individuals
to
be
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that
happens
to
every
car
when
the
checkpoint
is
running.
the
point
officer
makes
a
stop
or
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
stop
and
then
decides
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
allow
that
person
to
go
forward.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
with
every
car.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that
is
the
fleeting
stop,
then
he
selects--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
whatever
the
figure
is,
whatever
car
he
wants
to
have
further
inspected.
the
car
is
referred
to
the
secondary
area
off
the
road
and
during
this
time
between
60
--
during
the
average
time
of
the
secondary
stop
between
60
and
100
other
cars
will
be
waived
through
and
they
will
look
to
the
right
and
see
the
one
victim
being
interrogated
by
the
law
enforcement
officers
as
to
the
right
to
be
here.
that
stop
as
mr.
evans
indicated
is
approximately
three
to
five
minutes,
there
are
approximately
twelve
hundred
cars
going
through
this
checkpoint
every
hour
and
therefore
there
if
you
break
it
down
about
a
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
with
the
stop
the
initial
intrusion
without
any
factual
basis.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
if
you
justify,
if
you
can
justify
the
initial
intrusion
but
it
seems
to
me
the
fourth
amendment,
requires
the
factual
basis
for
the
stop.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yes.
i
mean,
without
a
factual
basis
to
allow
the
point
officer
to
be
in
the
position
to
see
that
i
would
submit
that
is
arbitrary
capricious
and
unconstitutional.
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
is
to
have
a
factual
predicate
for
a
seizure
and
without
factual
predicate
for
the
seizure
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
unjustified
to
stop
a
person
who
is
going
fifty
five
miles
an
hour
on
an
interstate
highway
66
miles
north
of
the
border
without
any
connection
to
the
border
at
all.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yes,
i
know
the
government
has
alluded
that
this
is
the
equivalent
of
a
red
light.
well,
at
a
red
light
you
do
not
have
armed
law
enforcement
officers
inspecting
your
physiognomy,
interior
of
your
car
and
deciding
whether
or
not
they
want
to
refer
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
they
could.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
i
agree,
i
agree
absolutely.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that
is
correct
but
that
is
not
what
is
happening.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that
is
not
what
is
happening
in
these
cases
and
i
would
submit
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
stop
procedure
is
to
allow
the
officers
to
look
the
individuals
to
seize
them
momentarily
and
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
they
are
going
to
allow
the
person
free
passage
or
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
the
only
point
is
the
stop
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
that
is
the
beginning
of
the
whole
intrusion.
the
stop
--
i
objected
the
initial
stop
and
of
course
we
would
perforce
object
to
the
intrusion
that
follows
being
referred
off
the
highway
and
interrogated
for
three
to
five
minutes
but
i
would
object
to
both.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
at
a
stop
sign
somewhere
in
the
city
any
officer
can
look
at
traffic
just
as
any
citizen
can
but
they
cannot
put
up
a
road
block
to
stop
all
north
bound
traffic
66
miles
north
to
the
boarder
and
above
19
communities
and
some
two
million
inhabitants
just
to
stop
people
to
see
if
they
look
like
citizens
or
local
residents.
after
all,
there
are
a
lot
of
legal
citizens
and
residents
of
brown
skin
who
have
a
right
to
proceed
northward,
and
if
we
are
talking
about
the
right
to
have
fleeting
stop
what
is
going
to
be
the
factor
that
the
officer
grasps
on
to
decide
whether
to
waive
someone
to
secondary,
it
is
going
to
be
a
race.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
if
he
can
see
that,
but
the
more
typical
case
is
just
going
to
be
the
random
arbitrary
decision
to
refer
someone
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
not
in
my
case,
no,
there
is
no
record
on
what
he
saw.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
laying
down
after
the
initial
stop,
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
it
may
have
allowed
for
a
further
investigation
but
that
is
not
the
factors
in
my
case
and
again
i
would
do
some
hard
back
to
my
point
that
without
a
factual
predicate
under
brignoni-ponce
there
is
no
basis
for
stopping
an
individual
who
is
proceeding
away
from
the
border.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
there
were
two
women
and
they
are
seated
up
right
in
the
passenger
compartment.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
oh,
yes,
yes,
but
the
point
is
that
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
he
probably
would
not.
the
names
of
these
cases
i
think
tell
something
about
what
goes
on
at
the
checkpoint
with
almeida-sanchez.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yes,
but
there
is
more
to
it,
if
i
was
representing
a
non-mexican
individual.
he
would
not
be
just
stopped
at
the
primary
point
he
would
be
waved
off
the
road
and
subjected
to
interrogations.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
constitutionally
i
would
make
the
same
argument
practically
i
would
take
the
case.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
what
is
that?
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that
is
all
we
have
and
that
is
the
whole
point
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
protect
those
intrusions
so
these
people
do
not
have
to
sue
the
government
for
a
five
second
stop.
there
is
no
forum
unless
there
is
a
factual
predicate
upon
which
an
officer
bases
his
decision.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that
is
the
beginning
that
is
the
constitutional
intrusion.
the
facts
of
our
case
are
of
course
more
aggravated
than
that
but
that
is
the
beginning
of
the
intrusion
certainly.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
we
would
have
a
plaintiff's
case
but
as
we
stated
in
ortiz
to
this
court
we
quoted
in
the
amsterdam's
article,
there
is
no
lawyer
in
the
world
that
would
take
a
case
like
that
and
that
is
why
the
fourth
amendment
require
some
protection
for
the
innocent
citizenry
who
travels
north
ward
in
the
california.
no
one
is
going
to
take
a
suit
like
that,
we
have
to
have
a
reasonable
basis,
a
factual
predicate
for
the
actions
of
the
officers.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
i
hardly
written
a
few,
your
honor.[laughing]
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
if
it
was
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
prevent
the
officers
from
doing
that
in
a
form
of
a
class
action
we
have
a
case.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that
is
what
i
said.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
right.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
as
a
practical
matter
he
would
have
a
claim
but
it
would
be
de
minimis
unless
it
was
a
class
action
of
course
and
then
they
could
hand
out
$5
bills
to
everyone
they
stopped.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yeah,
that
is
a
lesser
intrusion
it
is
still
an
intrusion
without
a
factual
basis.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that
is
an
extension
of
the
intrusions.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
basically
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
absolutely
not,
that
is
not
the
case
here
at
all.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
brignoni-ponce
roving
patrol
officers
do
not
have
any
thing
to
deal
with
regulating
highway
usage.
and
also
the
only
way
you
can
enforce
the
law
with
respect
traffic
safety
and
individual
carrying
a
license
is
to
stop
the
individual
on
the
road
and
see
if
they
have
a
driver’s
license.
there
are
numerous
alternatives
to
deterrent
or
apprehending
illegal
aliens
in
this
country
once
they
have
intruded
into
the
interior
of
this
country.
so
there
are
number
of
alternatives
to
the
police
power
of
a
state
regulating
highway
usage
and
safety
which
are
not
analogies
by
any
means
to
this
case
and
as
the
court
said
to
brignoni
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
border
patrol
stop
cases.
that
is
not
the
issue.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yes.
well,
as
the
baca
hearing
show
there
has
to
be
some
commitment
by
congress
to
solving
this
problem.
the
government
attorneys
make
a
very
persuasive
pitch
to
the
courts
to
solve
the
problem
and
as
justice
white
included
the
courts
cannot
solve
the
problem
alone.
we
need
some
help
from
a
legislative
branch.
for
one
thing
in
the
baca
hearing,
and
as
you
will
see
in
our
brief
there
are
only
30
people,
30
border
patrol
man
on
a
typical
day
shift
covering
the
entire
california
mexican
border.
30
people
for
about
a
125
to
a
140
miles
of
border.
that
is
an
impossible
situation
they
have
not
got
enough
man
to
respond
to
their
sensor
alerts
on
the
border.
they
have
not
got
enough
money
to
repair
the
fences
that
are
down
in
the
high
smuggling
areas.
they
cannot
even
replace
fences.
one
of
the
agents,
testify
in
the
baca
hearings
is
that
the
appropriations
to
get
the
fences
repaired
have
been
stricken
in
congress
every
year.
and
of
course
the
major
deterrent
even
as
the
border
patrol
officials
can
see
the
major
deterrent
is
going
to
be
the
pass
legislation
to
cut
off
the
magnet
for
the
illegal
alien
entering
this
country,
and
that
is
employment.
in
this
court
cannot
legislate
that
legislation,
it
has
to
come
from
congress,
and
if
they
are
concerned
about
the
problem
enough
to
solve
it,
i
do
not
think
that
we
should
dilute
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
solve
a
law
enforcement
problem
which
congress
has
control
over
but
has
not
deemed
fit
at
this
point
at
least
to
try
to
solve
it.
and,
i
think
unless
they
go
to
that
alternative
we
should
not
take
the
lowest
constitutional
role
to
solve
the
problem
as
justice,
judge
oaks
has
said
in
the
second
circuit.
a
border
patrol
stop
case
in
the
united
state
versus
barbera.
so
there
are
other
circuits
also
that
have
looked
at
this
problem
and
you
know
the
only
link
of
the
written
opinions
which
rule
on
this
issue
are
the
ones
that
hold
up
the
fourth
amendment
protections
applied
because
those
are
the
only
ones
that
can
be
written
with
--
that
are
easy
to
write.
the
other
ones
are
one
line
opinion
saying
it
appears
reasonable.
the
stop
is
not
reasonable
without
a
factual
predicate
giving
the
officers
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
illegal
activity
as
a
flit
and
that
is
the
language
directly
out
of
terry
versus
ohio
where
reasonable
was
defined.
the
only
way
that
we
can
take
the
factual
predicate
away
is
if
we
are
in
a
purely
administrative
atmosphere
such
as
cameron
this
court
held
in
almeida-sanchez
that
the
administrative
analogy
does
not
apply
and
it
does
not
apply
here
either
where
in
the
same
situation.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
as
i
understand
it
senator
mcclellan
who
is
the
head
of
immigration
subcommittee
in
the
senate
has
decided
to
hold
the
first
meeting
of
this
subcommittee
in
seven
years
to
consider
the
rodino
bill
or
rodino
type
bill.
the
rodino
bill
has
passed
the
house
several
times
as
i
understand
it.
it
has
never
been
brought
to
the
floor
of
the
senate.
and
as
i
understand
it
and
i
read
in
the
paper
about
a
month
or
two
ago
that
the
senator
mcclellan
has
decided
to
call
a
meeting
of
this
subcommittee,
and
i
think
that
is
where
the
answer
lies.
no
matter
what
the
decision
this
court
makes
in
these
cases,
the
illegal
alien
problem
is
not
going
to
go
away.
when
border
patrol
powers
were
in
full
flower
the
problem
was
as
great
as
it
is
today
and
i
made
an
estimate
in
our
brief
that
up
to
20%
of
mexico
is
currently
residing
illegally
in
this
country,
if
you
take,
accepting
the
border
patrol’s
figures.
that
of
course
came
about
with
border
patrol
powers
in
full
flower,
it
is
an
ineffective
deterrent.
they
can
get
through
--
san
clemente
for
example
is
only
open
70%
of
the
time
and
95%
of
the
alien
traversing
through
that
checkpoint
get
through.
it
is,
san
clemente
is
in
effective
deterrent
as
are
all
border
patrol
checkpoint.
and
the
other
point,
the
irony
of
this
case
is
the
brignoni-ponce
involved
the
same
area
the
san
clemente
checkpoint.
in
that
case,
rather
than
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
highway
the
officer
of
course
proceeded
in
a
car
perpendicular
to
the
roadway
saw
mr.
brignoni,
and
thought
he
was
a
mexican
looking
individual
pulled
out
and
stopped
him.
the
only
difference
in
this
case
is
that
the
officer
who
is
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
i
cannot
believe
that
that
difference
is
of
constitutional
significance
when
people’s
right
through
at
stake
and
especially
when
the
discretion
which
is
unbridled
at
this
point
for
a
point
officer
to
decide
to
take
people
off
the
road
is
so
subject
to
possible
abuse
because
we
are
dealing
with
sensitive
factors
such
as
the
racial
appearance
of
an
individual
and
in
southern
california
we
have
a
substantial
mexican
american
population
who
are
validly
residing
here.
for
the
government
to
say
well
the
point
officer
only
stops
or
lets
through
the
local
inhabitant,
it
is
unrealistic
to
believe
that
a
point
officer
is
going
to
know
the
1.5
million
residents
who
are
in
southern
--
south
of
the
san
clemente
checkpoint.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that
is
my
understanding,
yes.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
no
but
that
is
certainly
something
for
a
congress
to
act
upon
if
they
want
to
solve
the
problem.
if
the
government
considers
it
as
a
problem
as
i
said
before
it
seems
to
me
that
they
should
be
acting
upon
it
rather
than
the
government
attorneys
coming
to
the
courts
to
ask
for
a
dilution
of
traditional
fourth
amendment
protections.
and
if
i
might
say
something
about
the
warrants
as
my
time
is
just
about
out.
this
is
a
warrant
perhaps
not
against
the
entire
american
nation
but
it
is
a
warrant
against
the
entire
population
of
southern
california.
the
warrant
was
unlimited,
it
was
perpetual,
it
did
not
even
attempt
to
meet
justice
powell’s
four
factors
in
almeida-sanchez
for
the
functional
equivalent
of
probable
cause,
because
it
could
not,
99.9
%
of
the
vehicles,
not
the
people
but
vehicles
going
to
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
contains
no
aliens
at
all,
no
illegal
aliens.
and
of
course
the
figure
would
be
higher
for
the
number
of
people
traversing
that
checkpoint.
that
in
no
way
could
be
deemed
the
functional
equivalent
or
probable
cause.
second,
there
is
no
nexus
to
the
border.
there
is,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
equation
for
functional
equivalency
which
was
not
even
attempted
to
be
met
in
this
warrant,
there
is
no
nexus
to
the
border.
66
miles
from
the
border,
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
we
attached
a
little
appendix
here
to
show
where
the
border
is
at
the
bottom
and
some
66
miles
north
of
the
border
up
near
the
san
clemente
area
is
the
checkpoint
along
i5
the
major
route
north
for
southern
californians
and
it
is
above
some
19
major
communities
including
san
diego
and
ocean
side.
so,
this
warrant
as
the
court
below
indicated
does
not
even
approach
to
justice
powell’s
criteria,
the
magistrate
merely
concluded
there
was
cause
to
believe
that
massive
immigration
violation
were
taking
place
without
even
citing
a
particular
statute.
he
just
said,
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
violations
of
title
vii
were
taking
place,
and
we
say,
consider
a
warrant
which
indicated
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
title
18
violations
were
taking
place
in
an
area.
it
is
much
too
wide
it
is
not
the
type
of
warrant
that
is
near
for
a
location,
near
the
border
to
be
form
as
a
stop
gap
for
areas
where
there
is
no
border
patrol
port
of
entry
where
people
can
be
checked.
in
our
brief
we
do
include
the
alternative
because
the
government
pitches
its
case
on
the
need
--
we
point
out
that
there
are
numerous
alternatives
the
border
patrol
has
about
ten
other
programs
other
than
traffic
checking.
they
include
farm
and
ranch
checking,
airport
terminal
checking,
industrial
checking.
i
might
--
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
in
20
dyas
in
los
angeles
the
border
patrol
captured
12,000
illegal
aliens
in
20
days,
70
agents
in
a
20-day
working
period
captured
12,000
in
los
angeles
area
just
walking
along
the
street
and
asking
for
their
identification.
that
is
a
much
more
efficient
way
of
doing
things
than
stopping
the
ingress
of
the
entire
southern
california
population
into
the
los
angeles
area
and
points
northward.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
as
long
is
there
no
seizure
of
the
individual
--
at
the
checkpoint
there
are
seizure
taking
place,
you
cannot
go
any
place.
if
you
try
to
run
the
checkpoint
you
are
going
to
be
flight
down
and
arrest
and
if
you
do
not
answer
you
going
to
be
detained
until
you
come
up
with
an
answer
that
satisfies
the
officer
of
the
checkpoint.
if
someone
is
walking
along
the
street
and
they
simply
asked
a
question,
as
long
there
is
no
seizure
according
to
i
think
it
was
justice
white
in
terry
versus
ohio
there
is
probably
no
problem,
we
are
just
asking
the
question.
there
are
many
in
situation
where
officers
simply
ask
questions
of
individual
said
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yes.
thank
you.
