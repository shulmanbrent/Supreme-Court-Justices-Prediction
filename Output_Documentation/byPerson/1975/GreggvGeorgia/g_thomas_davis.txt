mr.
g.
thomas
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
argue
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
georgia.
briefly
at
the
beginning,
i
was
to
address
a
few
of
the
comments
made
by
mr.
harrison
as
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
do
not
wish
to
re-argue
the
case
factually.
the
jury
determined
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
mr.
gregg
was
guilty
of
two
murders
with
malice
or
in
the
commission
of
an
armed
robbery.
mr.
harrison
has
intimated
that
another
man
involved
in
the
crime
for
somehow
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
not
sentenced
to
death,
but
given
a
sentence
of
ten
years.
mr.
harrison
has
failed
to
point
out
that
the
other
man
mr.
allan
involved
was
16
years
of
age
and
could
not
have
been
punished
by
death
in
georgia.
additionally,
there
was
no
evidence
to
indicate
that
he
had
any
prior
knowledge
of
mr.
greggs
planning
to
kill
this
two
men.
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
furman,
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
in
1973
enacted
a
new
procedure,
a
new
death
statute
procedure.
in
doing
so
they
allowed
controlled
discretion.
in
complying
with
this
courts
decision
in
furman,
they
eliminated
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness
on
the
imposition
as
this
court
had
held
was
present.
they
eliminated
that
from
the
imposition
of
a
death
sentence.
they
did
that
in
several
ways.
first,
they
set
out
ten
aggravating
circumstances
by
statute
and
as
mr.
harrison
says,
they
are
also
provided
any
other
aggravating
circumstance
allowed
by
law,
otherwise
allowed
by
law
which
simply
means
any
other
way
in
georgia
law,
you
could
find
an
aggravating
circumstance
and
that
to
my
knowledge
is
only
one
other
place
and
only
one
aggravating
circumstance
which
would
be
a
prior
conviction,
which
is
not
included
in
the
first
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
which
provides
for
prior
capital
convictions
and
prior
convictions
of
serious
criminal
assault
brought.
in
other
words,
the
district
attorney
could
present
an
aggravation
and
say
a
prior
burglar,
however,
before
death
sentence
can
may
imposed,
the
jury
must
determine
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
presence
of
one
of
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances.
it
is
true
that
the
general
assembly
did
not
define
mitigating
circumstances.
they
said
mitigating
circumstances
as
otherwise
provided
by
law.
again,
they
are
referring
us
back
to
the
general
bifurcated
trial
act
which
allows
that
open
to
the
defense
counsel
to
permit
him
to
present
evidence
of
any
factor
which
could
legally
be
considered
in
mitigation
not
barred
by
the
constitution
rules
of
evidence
and
some
other
general
rule.
they
provided
in
a
very
important
part
of
the
procedure
for
swift
and
immediate
appellate
review.
this
review
was
directed
to
include
an
examination
of
the
record
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
an
examination
of
a
trial
report
which
is
included,
the
trial
report
in
this
case
by
the
trial
judge
is
included
in
appendix
b
to
respondent's
brief,
to
determine
the
presence
of
any
passion
prejudice
or
any
other
arbitrary
factor.
second,
they
were
mandated
by
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
to
determine
whether
the
evidence
in
fact
supported
the
aggravating
circumstance
found
and
third,
to
examine
other
cases,
to
determine
whether
the
senates
imposed
in
that
particular
case
under
review
was
disproportionate,
to
the
senates
imposed
in
other
similar
cases
considering
both
the
crime
and
the
defendant.
a
third
thing
that
the
general
assembly
did
was
to
provide
for
a
bifurcated
trial
procedure.
they
did
not
do
this
under
this
senate's
act,
but
it
was
done
before.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
yes,
your
honor.
first
there
was
determination
of
guilt
and
non-guilt,
second
was
the
punishment.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
that
is
right.
he
indicated
the
--
there
was
not
evidence
submitted
at
the
second
phase
of
the
trial
in
mitigation
and
that
i
think
that
is
what
he
had
intended
by
the
court
and
he
saw
none
in
the
trial
and
chief.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
there
was
nothing
proffered,
your
honor.
his
charge
to
the
jury
on
that
point
is
in
respondent's
brief
at
page
15.
he
charged
him
so
they
could
consider
in
a
mitigating
circumstances
that
they
saw
from
the
evidence.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
i
am
not
aware
of
any
your
honor.
in
all
felony
cases
the
law
provides
for
bifurcated
trial.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
punishment.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
the
instruction
as
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
was
just
what
the
court
charged
in
the
mitigating
factor.
the
statute
requires
that
the
trial
court
determine
from
the
evidence
presented
what
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
are
warranted.
he
then
gives
those
in
charge
to
the
jury
and
any
mitigating
is
presented,
warranted
by
the
evidence.
they
are
also
given
to
the
jury
in
writing.
the
jury
and
of
course
argument
--
counsel
before
he
does
this
of
course
is
the
opportunity
for
counsel
to
present
additional
evidence
of
aggravation
or
of
mitigation.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
in
writing
--
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
--
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
believe
if
i
understood
mr.
harrison
correctly
stated
that
the
jury
returned
or
found
three
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
in
this
case.
my
recollection
is
they
found
two.
three
were
submitted
to
them,
they
refused
to
find
number
7.
a
number
looking
specifically
now
at
the
ten
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
in
georgia,
they
are
set
out
at
pages
28
and
29
of
respondent's
brief,
a
number
of
these
aggravating
circumstances
have
been
attacked
either
by
petitioner
or
amicus
on
behalf
of
petitioner
as
being
overly
broad,
as
being
meaningless
and
i
want
to
look
at
the
few
of
those
now.
they
attack
number
three,
which
says
that
the
act
of
murder
and
armed
robbery
or
kidnapping,
knowingly
creating
a
great
risk
of
harm
or
death
to
anyone
in
a
public
place
by
means
of
a
weapon
and
so
on
and
endangering
the
lives
of
more
than
one
person,
that
could
fit
many
things,
but
to
understand
the
georgia
of
death
statute,
one
must
look
at
the
bare
wording
of
the
statute
in
light
of
the
refinements
added
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
the
case
of
marcus
wayne
chenault
versus
state,
this
was
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
was
found.
what
mr.
chenault
did
was
to
avenues
of
bad
discharge
in
atlanta
on
a
sunday
morning
during
a
worship
service.
he
sprayed
the
congregation
with
gunfire,
killing
two
members
of
that
congregation
and
if
i
recall
correctly
wounding
others.
now,
the
jury
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
number
three.
on
the
other
hand
and
the
supreme
court
of
course
had
no
difficulty
in
affirming
it
as
being
supported
by
the
evidence,
however,
on
the
other
hand
in
the
case
of
joe
versus
state,
it
was
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
abducted
a
woman
at
gunpoint
in
a
shopping
center
parking
lot.
the
state
sought
aggravating
circumstance
number
3,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said
no.
the
evidence
did
not
support
it.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
they
submitted
evidence,
the
jury
returned
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
very
definitely.
that,
and
again
the
point
i
am
attempting
to
make
of
course
is
that
that
the
entire
picture
is
not
present
when
one
looks
at
the
bare
wording
of
these
aggravating
circumstances.
under
georgia’s
procedure
of
the
supreme
court
play
such
a
major
role
that
to
understand
them
one
must
view,
the
refinements
added
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
another
statutory
aggravating
circumstance,
they
attack
as
being
meaningless
and
over
broad
is
number
seven
which
involves
torture
and
depravity
of
mind.
in
the
case
of
mccorquodale
versus
state
where
mccorquodale
tortured
a
young
woman
for
several
hours
by
use
of
acid,
fire,
surgical
scissors,
kept
her
alive,
it
is
amazing
the
woman
lived
as
long
as
she
did,
finally
breaking
her
limbs
and
stuffing
her
into
a
trunk.
the
jury
found
aggravating,
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
number
seven.
there
was
no
problem
in
affirming
that,
that
would
be
torture
to
anyone.
petitioner
in
brief
or
amicus,
i
may
refer
to
petitioner,
when
i
mean
the
legal
defense
fund
submitted
a
brief
in
his
behalf,
cites
the
case
of
floyd
v.
state
as
an
obvious
inappropriate
use
of
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
number
seven,
torture.
again,
the
question
is
overly
broad,
what
is
torture?
in
the
case
of
floyd,
floyd
in
of
the
home,
forced
the
mother
and
the
daughter
who
was
present
to
march
up
and
down
stairs
trying
to
force
from
them
the
location
of
money,
separated
them,
threatened
the
mother
with
cutting
fingers
of
the
daughter,
walked
them
together
and
knelt
them
down,
put
the
gun
to
the
daughter's
head,
kissed
her
goodbye
and
blew
her
brains
out
in
her
mother's
presence
and
then
turning
to
the
mother,
blew
her
brains
out,
laughing
that
she
put
up
her
hand
to
shield
from
the
bullet,
he
thought
that
was
humorous.
the
jury
filed
torture,
aggravating
circumstance
number
seven.
they
also
attacked
and
interestingly
so
the
aggravated
battery.
they
cite
the
case
of
mitchell
versus
state
to
support
the
misuse
of
that
and
i
think
one
of
the
law
professors
they
quote,
makes
the
remark
that
aggravated
battery
could
apply
to
any
one
in
--
any
one
murdered
that
displays
simply
a
base
misunderstanding
of
georgia
law.
not
so
and
it
has
never
been
used
in
the
state,
in
that
manner
and
again
the
misunderstanding
is
demonstrated
by
mitchell
v.
state,
they
cited,
to
make
the
statement
cited
mitchell
v.
state.
the
facts
in
mitchell,
mitchell
entered
the
grocery
store,
took
the
proprietor
who
was
a
middle
age
lady
and
her
young
son
back
to
the
cooler.
he
shoots
the
young
son,
he
shoots
the
mother,
he
leaves.
this
one
is
in
the
course
of
a
robbery,
he
leaves
he
thinks,
he
better
return
and
make
sure
that
his
work
is
done
well,
he
returns
shoots
again
the
son,
shoots
again
twice
more
the
mother.
he
killed
the
son,
but
he
did
not
kill
the
mother,
even
though
shot
three
times,
once
in
the
back,
the
shoulder
and
the
head,
she
lived
to
testify
against
him
at
his
trial.
that
was
the
aggravated
battery
present
in
mitchell,
not
to
the
dead
son.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
yes.
your
honor.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
by
our
records
55.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
one
has
been
completely
set
aside.
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
were
there
where
a
number
of
death
sentences
imposed
and
they
have
set
various
ones
of
those
aside.
the
case
of
coley
v.
state
is
one
of
they
completely
vacated
the
death
sentence
on
the
grounds
--
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
for
example
compared
to
this
case
gregg,
gregg
was
sentenced
to
four
death
sentences
by
the
jury.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
that
is
correct.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
there
would
a
new
trial
as
to
punishment.
there
would
be
of
course
(voice
overlap)
with
no
possibility
of
death
sentence?
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
no
possibility
of
the
death
sentence.
let
me
point
out
for
clarity.
when
i
used
the
figure
55,
there
had
not
been
55
cases
in
supreme
court
of
georgia.
i
was
answering
the
question
of
how
many
death
sentences
were
imposed.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
decided
30,
30
or
31
cases.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
it
depends
on
what
stage
of
the
process
they
are.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
none
have
been
decided.
some
have
been
docketed,
not
decided
and
some,
this
55
figure
includes
up
to
two
weeks
ago.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
looking
--
leaving
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
and
going
to
the
appellant
review,
in
responding
to
this
court's
decision
in
furman,
the
general
assembly
of
course
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
--
with
having
to
remove
arbitrariness
or
capriciousness
in
fact
from
their
procedure.
the
general
assembly
determined
not
to
eliminate
the
authority
of
the
jury
of
the
trial
judge
to
bring
to
bare
in
a
case,
the
community
values
and
their
first
hand
understanding
of
the
facts
in
that
particular
case.
they
wanted
to
allow
the
judge,
the
jury,
the
fact
finder
to
tailor
make
the
punishment
to
the
defendant
in
that
particular
case,
keeping
in
mind
and
reiterating
the
principle
set
down
by
this
court
in
witherspoon
and
in
mcgautha
and
at
the
same
time
eliminating
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness
from
the
procedure
and
of
course
they
did
that
with
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances,
but
very
importantly
with
the
appellant
review
which
mandates
as
i
have
stated
earlier,
the
specific
review
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
for
the
presence
of
any
arbitrariness
factor.
they
enunciate
passion,
prejudice
or
any
other
according
to
statute
arbitrary
factor,
the
court
is
to
examine
in
detail
the
record,
the
trial
report
which
is
a
number
of
pages
law.
in
the
trial
report
there
are
six
questions
which
deal
with
whether
race
was
in
any
way
an
issue
in
that
case.
second
of
course
the
in-depth
determination
of
whether
the
evidence
supported
the
aggravating
circumstance.
both
of
those
of
course
look
to
the
case
itself
to
ensure
fairness
and
non
arbitrariness
in
that
particular
case.
the
third
standard
and
the
third
thing
mandated
by
the
general
assembly
was
to
compare
this
case
with
the
other
cases
and
the
statute
says
other
similar
cases
considering
defendant,
considering
crime
and
of
course
the
court
has
the
power,
if
it
finds
any
of
that
to
vacate
the
death
sentence.
this
is
in
addition
of
course
to
normal
appellate
review.
that
was
the
mechanism
or
at
least
a
principle
mechanism
which
was
placed
into
the
georgia
death
penalty
procedure
to
ensure
non
arbitrariness.
but
what
does
petitioner
say
to
that?
in
brief,
they
point
to
two
cases
as
being
a
prime
example
of
arbitrariness
on
behalf
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
they
point
to
the
case
of
coley,
coley
was
a
rape
case,
an
escaped
felon.
he
was
robbing
a
store,
abducted
a
woman
right
there
and
was
apprehended.
he
was
sentenced
to
death
by
the
jury.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
vacated,
just
proportion
of
it.
the
case
of
coker,
an
escaped
felon,
who
goes
out
and
enters
a
home,
rapes
a
young
woman
who
had
given
birth
three
before
in
the
presence
of
her
husband,
abducts
her
and
he
is
apprehended.
he
has
sentenced
to
death.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
affirmed.
what
petitioner
does
not
point
out
to
the
court
that
coker,
the
second
case
had
brought
convictions
for
rape
and
kidnapping,
one
instance.
another
instance
for
rape,
aggravated
assault,
another
instance
of
rape
and
murder,
a
brutal
murder
of
a
young
girl
that
he
had
raped,
these
factors
were
certified
and
submitted
to
the
jury
under
statutory
aggravating
circumstance
number
one.
i
submit
there
is
no
arbitrariness
there,
that
there
is
no
lack
of
reason,
there
is
no
lack
of
justification.
it
would
seem
apparent
to
anyone
of
common
human
understanding,
while
coker’s,
death
sentence
was
affirmed
and
coley’s
was
vacated.
if
i
understand
the
arguments
of
petitioner
and
the
arguments
made
yesterday
and
earlier,
what
is
being
complained
out
under
the
eight
amendment
is
arbitrariness
in
fact.
now,
as
i
understand
the
case
of
furman,
it
did
not
say
that
discretion
was
unconstitutional,
but
that
arbitrariness
or
system
which
led
to
arbitrariness
in
fact
are
the
wanton
and
freakish
imposition
of
a
death
sentence
was
what
was
unconstitutional.
if
so
and
if
that
is
the
way
i
understand
and
i
was
listening
to
the
way
he
used
the
word
arbitrary,
or
arbitrariness
and
he
said
spared
for
no
meaningful
basis
without
rhyme
or
reason,
without
justification,
no
rational
basis.
if
that
is
the
standard,
what
has
been
shown
about
the
of
georgia
procedure?
has
arbitrariness
in
fact
been
demonstrated
to
any
degree?
we
maintain
that
what
must
be
of
avoided
as
is
the
wanton
and
freakish
imposition,
not
that
everyone
who
should
get
a
death
sentence
under
a
system
of
justice
or
concept
of
justice,
that
a
few
escape
or
have
they
even
shown
any
one
escaping.
it
is
interesting
to
note
some
footnotes
in
their
brief
where
they
try
to
bracket
and
compare
cases
in
georgia
and
say
and
one
prime
one
is
gregg,
this
case,
two
cold
blooded
murders
and
an
armed
robbery,
gregg
sentenced
to
death.
they
cite
the
case
of
brandon
v.
state,
two
cold
blooded
murders
and
of
course
of
an
armed
robbery,
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
by
the
jury,
imprisonment
by
the
jury.
what
they
failed
to
note
is
that
brandon
was
fourteen
years
of
age
and
i
seriously
ask
this
court
in
considering
those
cases,
in
those
briefs
to
look
below
the
surface
facts
shown.
in
almost
every
case
cited,
you
will
see
the
circumstantial
evidence
appearing.
you
will
see
the
felony
murder
appearing,
not
the
malice
murder,
felony
murder,
confused
evidence
as
to
who
was
the
perpetrator,
the
youth,
the
question
about
middle
capacity,
they
appear
in
every
case
cited.
the
statutory
aggravating
circumstances
in
georgia
with
the
appellate
review
has
led
to
a
group
of
criminals
who
have
committed
horrible,
veil,
heinous
crimes
being
sentenced
to
death.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
i
really
do
not,
your
honor,
i
do
not
what
to
--
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
of
the
total
55,
i
could
not
say.
of
those
that
have
been
docketed
and
have
been
decided
by
the
court,
there
are
three
for
rape,
one
of
which
is
coker
i
discussed
with
this
prior,
the
other
two
was
rape
and
kidnapping
together,
a
woman
who
was
staked
out
over
five
dead,
they
also
had
prior
capital
felony
convictions,
those
are
the
only
verdicts.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
the
statute
provides
it.
looking
to
fine
line
added
by
the
court,
the
court
had
said
that
that
a
death
sentence
for
armed
robbery
in
georgia,
in
other
words,
if
you
took
the
facts
of
gregg,
eliminated
the
two
murders,
that
is
disproportionate
and
a
death
sentence
cannot
be
imposed,
they
are
none
in
georgia
that
are
armed
robbery
without
murder.
mr.
g.
thomas
davis
of
course
what
the
court
said
would
have
to
be
considered
in
light
of
the
facts
present
in
gregg
and
of
course
the
same
thing
with
the
rape
that
was
present
in
coley.
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
of
course
determined
that
a
death
sentence
is
justified
in
georgia
and
it
is
needed
in
georgia,
of
course,
for
a
number
of
reasons.
for
deterrents,
specific
deterrents
and
general
deterrents,
we
have
some
of
those
under
death
sentence
now,
who
are
under
life
sentences
for
capital
crimes,
and
committed
more
capital
crimes
on
escape.
so
we
have
the
problem
with
specific
deterrents.
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
as
matter
of
policy
has
determined
that
there
is
a
general
deterrence
by
the
death
penalty.
we
respectively
submit
that
the
constitution
does
not
demand
that
the
balance
of
fear
weigh
more
heavily
on
the
citizen
than
on
the
potential
capital
criminal.
we
think
that
petitioner
has
not
demonstrated
arbitrariness
or
capriciousness
in
georgia
statutory,
what
is
happened
under
georgia’s
death
penalty
statute.
as
we
understand
furman
that
is
what
was
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
thank
you.
