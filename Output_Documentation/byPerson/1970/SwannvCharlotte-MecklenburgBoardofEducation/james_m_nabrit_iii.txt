mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
attempt
to
address
that
question
because
i
think
the
issue
of
establishing
a
desegregated
system
and
keeping
it
that
way
is
one
of
the
important
practical
problems
that
a
district
court
and
the
school
board
has
to
face.
let
me
begin
however
by
stating
that
it
is
our
view
that
judge
mcmillan's
decision
is
desegregation
order.
it
can
be
a
affirmed
on
either
of
two
grounds.
either
on
the
ground
that
he
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
in
ordering
a
plan
which
remedied
the
wrong
effect
and
also
that
it
can
be
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
judge
mcmillan
stated
the
proper
constitutional
objective.
well,
i
think
it's
helpful
if
we
get
down
to
specific
in
some
of
this,
and
not
talk
about
some
of
these
complicated
phrases
like
balancing
and
so
forth
which
have
different
meanings,
and
look
at
the
practical
problem
that
judge
mcmillan
faced
last
december
1st.
the
situation
was
this.
a
month
earlier,
this
court
had
ruled
in
the
alexander
case
that
integration
had
to
proceed
at
once.
judge
mcmillan
has
just
found
that
charlotte-mecklenburg
had
25
racially
identified
schools
in
which
2/3
of
the
black
children
in
the
city
were
located.
it
also
found
that
90%
of
the
fact
is
re-segregated.
and
he
had
just
received
the
school
board's
third
integration
plan,
since
april.
and
he
found
that
in
it
they
were
asserting
candidly
they
did
not
intend
to
eliminate
all
of
the
black
schools.
so
what
he
did
was
conscience
that
it
was
duty
under
alexander
to
proceed
expeditiously,
he
appointed
his
own
consultant
and
he
sat
down
to
in
the
december
1st
opinion,
trying
to
give
the
consultant
some
instructions
about
what
to
do.
now,
judge
mcmillan
had
found
that
the
all
black
schools
in
charlotte
were
created
by
state
action
and
he
concluded
that
it
was
his
duty
on
the
green
to
adopt
the
plan
that
would
remedy
that
situation,
to
establish
that
situation
and
he
further
had
heard
evidence
that
it
was
possible
that
there
were
plans.
so
he
appointed
an
expert
and
he
told
him
in
the
passage
that
mr.
horack
referred
to.
that
if
the
school
board
had
come
in
with
a
plan,
i
wouldn't
have
required
any
fixed
racial
ratios
or
anything
like
that.
but
in
default
of
them
bringing
you
plan,
you
should
sit
out
as
pursuing
the
ideal
objective
of
29:71,
but
understanding
that
you
may
not
be
able
to
reach
that.
and
you
told
them,
you
can
use
all
of
the
techniques
that
the
normal
administrative
techniques
of
assigning
pupils
and
report
back.
and
also
told
the
school
board
again,
you
have
another
opportunity,
a
fourth
opportunity
to
bring
back
a
plan.
the
plan
that
the
judge's
consultant
brought
back
was
not
a
plan
which
balanced
every
school.
the
percentage
of
blacks
in
the
system
under
the
plan
that
the
judge
ordered
varied
from
the
low
of
3%
blacks
in
the
school
to
the
higher
41%.
another
point
–
the
judge
gave
his
consultant
no
instructions
that
he
was
to
go
out
and
integrate
white
schools.
the
instruction
was,
that
he
was
to
eliminate
the
all
black
schools,
and
majority
black
schools.
and
that
was
based
on
a
conclusion
that
was
possible
to
do
so.
now,
in
the
final
analysis,
the
district
judge's
understanding
of
what
he
was
doing
was
that
he
was
following
green.
he
was
assessing
the
available
plans
and
picking
the
plan
that
accomplished
the
best
result.
i
submit
that
it
is
not
error
for
a
district
court
in
such
a
circumstance
to
require
a
school
board
to
do
more
than
the
minimum.
it's
not
the
district
judge's
job
to
try
to
find
the
fine
line
of
the
constitutional
demarcation
between
a
segregated
system
and
integrated
one
and
just
exactly
get
them
up
to
their
minimum
obligation.
it's
duty
as
set
in
the
green
case
is
to
desegregate
the
system
within
the
branch,
to
integrate
the
system
so
thoroughly,
that
segregation
will
not
reoccur
if
that
can
be
done.
now
we
come
to
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
exactly
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
is
absolutely
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
now
i'm
at
the
point
where
i
have
chief
justice's
question
about
the
duty
in
such
a
situation
to
try
to
plan
an
assignment
system,
that
will
work
in
terms
of
green.
and
that
will
not
immediately
revert
back
to
segregated
system.
and
what
the
court
consultant
did
was
to
use
these
normal
school
assignment
techniques.
techniques
that
the
school
have
been
using
all
along,
drawing
school
zones,
transporting
children
to
plan
strategies,
to
try
to
avoid
the
situation
immediately
turning
back
to
a
segregated
situation
and
he
was
doing
this
in
a
fact
pattern,
where
he
had
a
history
of
that
in
charlotte,
it
had
a
series
of
schools
that
had
been
integrated
and
turned
black.
so
that
the
effort
was
being
made
to
prevent
that
from
happening.
again,
now
that
the
--
now
and
this
really
bring
us
i
think
to
an
important
and
analytical
point,
and
that
is
that
the
school
boards
actually
do
control
the
racial
composition
of
the
schools.
necessarily
they
do
because
there
really
is
no
such
thing
as
a
neighborhood
school
that
exists
in
the
abstract.
the
school
board
determines
what
the
relevant
neighborhood
is
for
a
school,
by
a
whole
series
of
decisions.
those
are
the
decisions
that
relate
to
such
things
as
where
do
you
build
a
school
in
the
first
place?
how
big
do
you
build
it?
and
those
two
decisions
already
affect
in
a
sense
what
its
neighborhood
might
be.
when
you
decide
how
many
classrooms
to
put
there.
and
then
another
decision
that's
made
that
affects
it
is
when
you
decide
how
many
grades
you're
going
to
at
school
and
it's
not
true
--
these
cases
contain
records
of
the
school
board
using.
those
decisions
to
keep
the
place
segregated.
in
other
words,
if
you
had
a
compact
black
community
in
charlotte,
you'd
build
a
school
with
all
12
grades
serving
it
and
the
rights
as
per
that
black
community.
now
this
was
the
kind
of
the
jury
action
to
affirmatively
segregate
that
the
district
judge
had
been
talking
about.
we're
not
talking
about
things
pre-brown,
before
1954,
we're
talking
about
what's
been
going
on
during
all
this
massive
resistance
since
1954
as
well.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
i'm
not
addressing
in
any
of
those
areas.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
time
is
really
struggling.
let
me
try
to
answer
that.
i
mean
my
answer
is
yes
that
the
school
board
has
a
continuing
duty
to
control
the
racial
composition
of
the
schools.
however,
i
make
that
answer
against
the
background
of
facts
which
establish
that
the
school
board
inevitably
makes
decisions
which
are
going
to
affect
the
racial
composition.
in
other
words,
one
of
the
assumptions
underlying
much
of
this
is
the
assumption
that
if
you
have
a
compact
residential
neighborhood
zone
that
that
is
non
racial
or
neutral.
but
that's
not
showing
so
in
charlotte
because
it's
been
established
and
found
on
this
record
that
the
neighborhoods
were
racially
controlled
by
the
state
action
and
the
schools
were
built
to
fit
the
racial
neighborhoods.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
continuing
duty
to
keep
the
school
system
integrated
results
not
from
any
punitive
sense
or
sense
that
the
school
board
has
(inaudible)
and
that
you
have
to
monitor
them
for
any
continuing
period
of
time.
it
results
from
the
fact
that
their
decisions
are
inevitably
going
to
affect
the
racial
composition.
the
solicitor
general
would
have
us
think
that
the
choice
to
be
made
is
between
something
called
neighborhood
principles
on
the
one
hand
--something
called
racial
balancing
on
the
other
hand.
and
i
submit
that
is
simply
--
that's
just
simply
not
the
choice
that
faces
the
court.
what
the
court
really
has
to
decide
in
the
fundamental
sense
is
whether
or
not
the
school
systems
are
going
to
be
required
to
be
desegregated.
so
it's
a
result
test
that
we
ask.
not
a
feasibility
test,
not
a
workability
test.
it's
primarily
a
result
test
based
on
green.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
appreciate
that.
i
hope
i
can
use
the
time
wisely.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
real
problem
is
that
unless
we
have
a
test
based
on
results,
we
are
left
with
a
test
based
on
good
faith.
now,
in
discretion,
i
don't
mean
to
evade
your
question.
i'm
answering
it
in
this
way.
but
because
--
take
for
example,
the
standard
offered
by
the
solicitor
general,
that
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
factors
to
be
considered
are
and
he
names
five.
the
size
of
the
school
district,
the
number
of
schools
that
is
a
hardship
for
the
children
involved.
the
educational
soundness
of
the
assignment
plan,
and
the
resources
of
the
school
district.
now,
those
are
the
factors
that
the
courts
are
supposed
to
apply.
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
in
deciding
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
have
remaining
black
schools
in
a
particular
school
system.
and
i'm
saying
that
that's
so
vague
in
general.
what
it
really
amounts
to
is
a
good
faith
test.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
though
racially
identifiable
are
minority
schools
and
we
do
focused
on
that
because
it
--
the
segregation
system
had
two
characteristics,
i
think
that
it
had
at
least
two
that
are
relevant
to
this
analysis.
one
is,
that
black
children
were
excluded
by
law
from
white
schools.
the
opts
the
other
side
of
the
court
here,
the
fast
it
is,
that
they
were
required
to
attend
the
black
schools
--
the
all
black
school
as
one
of
the
principal
institutions
in
the
segregated
system.
this
is
the
place
where
black
children
are
set
aside
with
the
state's
command
that
they
are
not
fit
to
be
anywhere
else.
now,
it's
our
submission
that
the
reform
has
to
be
on
both
levels.
that
there
does
indeed
have
to
be
a
new
system
if
you
use
the
term
under
which
pupils
are
not
effectively
excluded
because
they're
black
from
these
schools
but
also
has
to
be
reformed
of
this
principal
institution
the
all
black
racially
identifiable
school.
now,
defining
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
do
not
speak
precisely.
it's
the
racially
identifiable
school
[voice
overlap]
yes
the
minority
racially
identifiable.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
by
that
--
now,
it's
the
black
minority.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
don't
say
that.
well
you
can
integrate
the
black
unless
you
integrate
the
white
pupils
and
so
i
suppose
i
will
follow.
we
are
not
offering
a
test
that's
based
on
the
theory
that
you
have
to
--
that
there
are
some
white
children
at
a
great
remote
distance
and
you
have
to
bus
pass
negro's
with
a
great
distance
to
get
those
white
children
some
integrated
experience
out
of
that.
that
might
be
good
for
them,
they
might
learn
more
about
the
world
is
like
if
they
had
that
experience.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
that's
not
our
submission.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no
it's
not.
that
plan
was
based
on
trying
to
develop
a
strategy
against
re-segregation.
the
point
was
that
west
side
of
charlotte
is
tending
to
go
black
and
the
court
consultant
thought
that
he
could
make
an
assignment
of
pupils
based
on
a
comparable
distance
to
all
the
other
assignments
of
the
high
school
level.
but
those
pupils
are
going
about
12
miles,
don't
go
anything
farther
than
average.
they
were
going
less
distance
than
the
average.
the
court
of
appeals
approved
that
on
that
basis.
that
he
would
prevent
--
you
try
to
cope
with
this
problem
of
re-segregation.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
attempt
to
address
that
question
because
i
think
the
issue
of
establishing
a
desegregated
system
and
keeping
it
that
way
is
one
of
the
important
practical
problems
that
a

the

that
he
was
following
green.
he
was
assessing
the
available
plans
and
picking
the
plan
that
accomplished
the
best
result.
i
submit
that
it
is
not
error
for
a
district
court
in
such
a
circumstance
to
require
a
school
board
to
do
more
than
the
minimum.
it's
not
the
district
judge's
job
to
try
to
find
the
fine
line
of
the
constitutional
demarcation
between
a
segregated
system
and
integrated
one
and
just
exactly
get
them
up
to
their
minimum
obligation.
it's
duty
as
set
in
the
green
case
is
to
desegregate
the
system
within
the
branch,
to
integrate
the
system
so
thoroughly,
that
segregation
will
not
reoccur
if
that
can
be
done.
now
we
come
to
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
exactly
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
that
is
absolutely
right.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
now
i'm
at
the
point
where
i
have
chief
justice's
question
about
the
duty
in
such
a
situation
to
try
to
plan
an
assignment
system,
that
will
work
in
terms
of
green.
and
that
will
not
immediately
revert
back
to
segregated
system.
and
what
the
court
consultant
did
was
to
use
these
normal
school
assignment
techniques.
techniques
that
the
school
have
been
using
all
along,
drawing
school
zones,
transporting
children
to
plan
strategies,
to
try
to
avoid
the
situation
immediately
turning
back
to
a
segregated
situation
and
he
was
doing
this
in
a
fact
pattern,
where
he
had
a
history
of
that
in
charlotte,
it
had
a
series
of
schools
that
had
been
integrated
and
turned
black.
so
that
the
effort
was
being
made
to
prevent
that
from
happening.
again,
now
that
the
--
now
and
this
really
bring
us
i
think
to
an
important
and
analytical
point,
and
that
is
that
the
school
boards
actually
do
control
the
racial
composition
of
the
schools.
necessarily
they
do
because
there
really
is
no
such
thing
as
a
neighborhood
school
that
exists
in
the
abstract.
the
school
board
determines
what
the
relevant
neighborhood
is
for
a
school,
by
a
whole
series
of
decisions.
those
are
the
decisions
that
relate
to
such
things
as
where
do
you
build
a
school
in
the
first
place?
how
big
do
you
build
it?
and
those
two
decisions
already
affect
in
a
sense
what
its
neighborhood
might
be.
when
you
decide
how
many
classrooms
to
put
there.
and
then
another
decision
that's
made
that
affects
it
is
when
you
decide
how
many
grades
you're
going
to
at
school
and
it's
not
true
--
these
cases
contain
records
of
the
school
board
using.
those
decisions
to
keep
the
place
segregated.
in
other
words,
if
you
had
a
compact
black
community
in
charlotte,
you'd
build
a
school
with
all
12
grades
serving
it
and
the
rights
as
per
that
black
community.
now
this
was
the
kind
of
the
jury
action
to
affirmatively
segregate
that
the
district
judge
had
been
talking
about.
we're
not
talking
about
things
pre-brown,
before
1954,
we're
talking
about
what's
been
going
on
during
all
this
massive
resistance
since
1954
as
well.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
think
i'm
not
addressing
in
any
of
those
areas.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
my
time
is
really
struggling.
let
me
try
to
answer
that.
i
mean
my
answer
is
yes
that
the
school
board
has
a
continuing
duty
to
control
the
racial
composition
of
the
schools.
however,
i
make
that
answer
against
the
background
of
facts
which
establish
that
the
school
board
inevitably
makes
decisions
which
are
going
to
affect
the
racial
composition.
in
other
words,
one
of
the
assumptions
underlying
much
of
this
is
the
assumption
that
if
you
have
a
compact
residential
neighborhood
zone
that
that
is
non
racial
or
neutral.
but
that's
not
showing
so
in
charlotte
because
it's
been
established
and
found
on
this
record
that
the
neighborhoods
were
racially
controlled
by
the
state
action
and
the
schools
were
built
to
fit
the
racial
neighborhoods.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
continuing
duty
to
keep
the
school
system
integrated
results
not
from
any
punitive
sense
or
sense
that
the
school
board
has
(inaudible)
and
that
you
have
to
monitor
them
for
any
continuing
period
of
time.
it
results
from
the
fact
that
their
decisions
are
inevitably
going
to
affect
the
racial
composition.
the
solicitor
general
would
have
us
think
that
the
choice
to
be
made
is
between
something
called
neighborhood
principles
on
the
one
hand
--something
called
racial
balancing
on
the
other
hand.
and
i
submit
that
is
simply
--
that's
just
simply
not
the
choice
that
faces
the
court.
what
the
court
really
has
to
decide
in
the
fundamental
sense
is
whether
or
not
the
school
systems
are
going
to
be
required
to
be
desegregated.
so
it's
a
result
test
that
we
ask.
not
a
feasibility
test,
not
a
workability
test.
it's
primarily
a
result
test
based
on
green.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
appreciate
that.
i
hope
i
can
use
the
time
wisely.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
the
real
problem
is
that
unless
we
have
a
test
based
on
results,
we
are
left
with
a
test
based
on
good
faith.
now,
in
discretion,
i
don't
mean
to
evade
your
question.
i'm
answering
it
in
this
way.
but
because
--
take
for
example,
the
standard
offered
by
the
solicitor
general,
that
the
solicitor
general
says
that
the
factors
to
be
considered
are
and
he
names
five.
the
size
of
the
school
district,
the
number
of
schools
that
is
a
hardship
for
the
children
involved.
the
educational
soundness
of
the
assignment
plan,
and
the
resources
of
the
school
district.
now,
those
are
the
factors
that
the
courts
are
supposed
to
apply.
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
in
deciding
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
have
remaining
black
schools
in
a
particular
school
system.
and
i'm
saying
that
that's
so
vague
in
general.
what
it
really
amounts
to
is
a
good
faith
test.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
though
racially
identifiable
are
minority
schools
and
we
do
focused
on
that
because
it
--
the
segregation
system
had
two
characteristics,
i
think
that
it
had
at
least
two
that
are
relevant
to
this
analysis.
one
is,
that
black
children
were
excluded
by
law
from
white
schools.
the
opts
the
other
side
of
the
court
here,
the
fast
it
is,
that
they
were
required
to
attend
the
black
schools
--
the
all
black
school
as
one
of
the
principal
institutions
in
the
segregated
system.
this
is
the
place
where
black
children
are
set
aside
with
the
state's
command
that
they
are
not
fit
to
be
anywhere
else.
now,
it's
our
submission
that
the
reform
has
to
be
on
both
levels.
that
there
does
indeed
have
to
be
a
new
system
if
you
use
the
term
under
which
pupils
are
not
effectively
excluded
because
they're
black
from
these
schools
but
also
has
to
be
reformed
of
this
principal
institution
the
all
black
racially
identifiable
school.
now,
defining
that
--
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
i
do
not
speak
precisely.
it's
the
racially
identifiable
school
[voice
overlap]
yes
the
minority
racially
identifiable.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
and
by
that
--
now,
it's
the
black
minority.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
well,
i
don't
say
that.
well
you
can
integrate
the
black
unless
you
integrate
the
white
pupils
and
so
i
suppose
i
will
follow.
we
are
not
offering
a
test
that's
based
on
the
theory
that
you
have
to
--
that
there
are
some
white
children
at
a
great
remote
distance
and
you
have
to
bus
pass
negro's
with
a
great
distance
to
get
those
white
children
some
integrated
experience
out
of
that.
that
might
be
good
for
them,
they
might
learn
more
about
the
world
is
like
if
they
had
that
experience.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
but
that's
not
our
submission.
mr.
james
m.
nabrit,
iii
no
it's
not.
that
plan
was
based
on
trying
to
develop
a
strategy
against
re-segregation.
the
point
was
that
west
side
of
charlotte
is
tending
to
go
black
and
the
court
consultant
thought
that
he
could
make
an
assignment
of
pupils
based
on
a
comparable
distance
to
all
the
other
assignments
of
the
high
school
level.
but
those
pupils
are
going
about
12
miles,
don't
go
anything
farther
than
average.
they
were
going
less
distance
than
the
average.
the
court
of
appeals
approved
that
on
that
basis.
that
he
would
prevent
--
you
try
to
cope
with
this
problem
of
re-segregation.
