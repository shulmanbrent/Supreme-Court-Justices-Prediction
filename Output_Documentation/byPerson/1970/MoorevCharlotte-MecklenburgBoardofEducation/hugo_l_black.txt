justice

black
what
is
the
longest
distance
this
record
shows?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
your
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
constitution
forbids
discrimination
on
account
of
race.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
it
forbids
discrimination
even
when
the

the
beneficent

trying

justice

black
discrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
key.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
you
are
saying
segregation
was
outlawed
whatever
you
called
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
have
you
printed
these
statutes
so
that
i
can
see
the
exact
part
of
it
which
you
say
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
number
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
20?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
is
the
part
you
are
claiming,
is
that
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
mr.
nabrit,
i'm
looking
at
the
statute
and
--
so
i
want
to
know
which
part
of
those
sentences
you
say
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
entire
synopsis,
no
student
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
will
be
assigned
or
compelled
to
attend
any
school
on
account
of
race.
surely
it
didn't
hold
that's
unconstitutional,
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
student
should
be
compelled
to
attend
or
not
attend
a
school
on
account
of
race
was
held
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
part
of
it
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
the
constitution
says.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
we
held.
you
can't
discriminate
on
account
of
race.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we‘re
done
with
that
argument,
i
thought
that
is
what
we
had
held
in
every
case
and
that's
what
your
client
had
been
insisting
on
in
every
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
provision
of
the
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
simply
says
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
clause
i've
just
read
to
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there's
a
saying
that
people
can
be
compelled
to
go
to
a
school
or
to
refrain
from
going
to
a
school
because
of
their
race.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
at
least
that
one
is
something
and
then
if
that's
--
if
the
whole
clause
is
held
unconstitutional,
i
don't
see
any
part
of
it
can
be
based
on
that
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
intent
of
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
i
hope
relying
on
--
have
probing
the
mind
of
the
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
your
--.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
of
course
reject
to
that
from
the
beginning,
absolutely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

by
a
subterfuge.
what
you're
saying
is,
can't
be
discriminated
against
by
subterfuge.
justice

black
page
number
281?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understood,
i
want
to
be
sure
quite
about
this,
someone
has
argued
as
you
are
saying
that
the
state
would
be
without
the
power
to
pass
a
regulation
doing
away
entirely
with
busing,
the
constitution
would
permit,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
our
logic
in
this
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
reason
i
asked
for
it,
i
had
always
thought
that
was
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
operate
schools
or
not
as
it
so
tendered
without
federal
litigations
and
i
would
suppose
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
would
repeal
all
its
laws
providing
public
schools
that
no
one
could
insist
that
the
federal
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
think
the
same
thing
about
busing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
the
state's
power
was
plenary
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
had
schools.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
we
have
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
found
there
was
a
discrimination
now
on
account
of
not
closing
them
all
down.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
under
equal
protection
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
equal
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
state
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
was
talking
about
was
absolute
abolition
of
public
schools,
i
wouldn't
think
it
could
be
any
question
about
that.
a
state's
power
to
do
that
are
absolutely
to
do
away
with
buses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
a
different
lawsuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
being
with
the
court
--
we
are
now
compelled
in
a
general
case
like
this.
we
look
into
the
question
to
determine
whether
if
schools
in
this
country
have
been
put
at
the
right
places
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
require
us
to
review
the
questions
with
reference
to
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
state,
wouldn't
the
school
that
just
had
been
placed
and
somewhat
--
case
other
than
--
when
directly
raise
that
point,
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

they
did
not
restraint
them
from
building
a
school,
did
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
by
this
court
that
if
--
it's
wrong,
it
would
seems
that
the
pattern
probably
be
wrong
all
over
the
united
states
and
we
would
have
to
--
our
courts
would
be
busy
trying
cases
of
whether
schools
are
located
at
the
right
spot
constitutionally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
it
did,
would
you
think
that
as
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
think
it'd
be
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
yet
the
charlotte
problem
--
do
you
think
it
is
unconstitutional
to
have
schools
whether
the
main
objective
is
to
have
them
close
to
the
children
in
the
surrounding
community
whether
they
call
them
neighborhood
schools
or
anything
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
problem
is
that
the
state
has
been
racially
defining
schools,
then
that's
a
different
problem
to
this.
if
you
are
saying
that
they
passed
laws
that
are
required
people
to
concentrated
in
one
section
rather
than
another,
i
think
you
would
admit
that's
quite
a
different
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
one
of
the
relation
is
set
down
by
laws
of
the
state?
well,
they
aren't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
law
of
north
carolina?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
pretty
big
job
to
assign
to
us,
isn't?
try
to
rearrange
the
areas
of
all
the
nation
where
the
people
have
naturally
concentrated
at
one
place
because
of
poverty
or
because
of
wealth
or
because
of
something
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
more
than
a
court
order
have
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what's
what
been
going
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
your
complaint
should
be
against
what
the
government
has
been
doing
there,
wouldn't
it?
how
can
you
rearrange
the
whole
country
in
such
fashion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
but
do
you
think
its
good
by
challenging
the
place
people
live
and
not
letting
them
have
schools
in
their
areas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understand
that
you
want
to
hold
people
miles
and
miles
and
miles
in
order
to
get
an
equal
percentage
of
the
races
in
the
schools,
that
they
don't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
right?
maybe
i'm
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
--
i
think
--
surely
you're
not
saying,
makes
no
difference
to
the
child?
justice
hugo
l.
black
might
be
separated
from
his
brothers
and
sisters,
he
might
be
transported
15
miles,
they
have
to
go
to
a
school,
one
of
them
is
two
miles
away
and
one
of
them
is
6
miles
away.
i
think,
if
there's
something
to
the
concept
of
the
neighborhood
schools,
that's
worthy
of
consideration
in
this
court,
particularly
and
we
have
to
divide
while
looking
at
maps.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
aren't
they
natural?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
they
find
findings
that
they
are
artificial,
the
neighborhoods
are
artificial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
to
you
sir
that
what
i
--
we
understood
is,
we've
been
understating
from
the
first
case,
if
this
plain
discrimination
on
account
of
race
take
on
emphasis,
i
think
we
should
correct
under
the
constitution
but
i
--
it
disturbs
me,
so
i
had
to
challenge
the
whole
arrangement
of
the
living
practice
as
in
the
way
of
life
that
the
people
all
over
this
nation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
have
any
schools
or
people
who
moved
to
places
because
they
are
close
to
a
school?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly
you
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
you
can
show
us,
in
any
of
these
particular
things,
where
the
order
has
been
approved
which
show
in
the
record
discrimination
against
the
race,
then
i'll
be
interested
in
but
i
don't
like
this
whole
theory
trying
to
condemn
a
whole
practice
and
do
away
with
what
i
considered
to
be
a
valuable
part
of
our
concise
--
i
believe
its
just
traditional,
of
the
neighborhood
school
idea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
perhaps
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
longest
distance
this
record
shows?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
your
argument
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
constitution
forbids
discrimination
on
account
of
race.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
it
forbids
discrimination
even
when
the

discrimination.
justice

that
is
the
key.
justice

black
i
presume
you
are
saying
segregation
was
outlawed
whatever
you
called
it?
justice

where
have
you
printed
these
statutes
so
that
i
can
see
the
exact
part
of

which
you
say
is
unconstitutional?
justice

black
number
what?
justice

black
20?
justice
hugo

and
that
is
the
part
you
are
claiming,
is
that
correct?
justice

l.
black
well,
mr.
nabrit,
i'm
looking
at
the

and
--
so
i
want
to
know
which

no

--
will
be

surely
it
didn't
hold
that's
unconstitutional,
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
student
should
be
compelled
to
attend
or
not
attend
a
school
on
account
of
race
was
held
unconstitutional?
justice

black
do
you
think
that
part
of
it
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
the
constitution
says.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
what
we
held.
you
can't
discriminate
on
account
of

justice

black
we‘re
done
with
that
argument,
i
thought
that
is

this

justice

black
--
the
clause
i've
just
read
to
you.
justice

well,
there's
a
saying
that
people
can
be
compelled
to
go
to
a
school
or
to
refrain
from
going
to
a
school
because
of
their
race.
justice
hugo

black
well
at
least
that
one
is
something
and
then
if
that's
--
if
the
whole
clause
is
held
unconstitutional,
i
don't
see
any
part
of
it
can
be
based
on
that
clause.
justice

of

you're

i
didn't

the

i
asked
for

that

the
problem
is
that
the
state
has
been
racially
defining
schools,
then
that's
a
different
problem
to
this.
if
you
are
saying
that
they
passed
laws
that
are
required
people
to
concentrated
in
one
section
rather
than
another,
i
think
you
would
admit
that's
quite
a
different
lawsuit?
justice
hugo
l.

one
of
the
relation
is
set
down
by
laws
of
the
state?
well,
they
aren't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
law
of
north
carolina?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

pretty
big
job
to
assign
to
us,
isn't?
try
to
rearrange
the
areas
of
all
the
nation
where
the
people
have
naturally
concentrated
at
one
place
because
of
poverty
or
because
of
wealth
or
because
of
something
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
more
than
a
court
order
have
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what's
what
been
going
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
your
complaint
should
be
against
what
the
government
has
been
doing
there,
wouldn't
it?
how
can
you
rearrange
the
whole
country
in
such
fashion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
but
do
you
think
its
good
by
challenging
the
place
people
live
and
not
letting
them
have
schools
in
their
areas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understand
that
you
want
to
hold
people
miles
and
miles
and
miles
in
order
to
get
an
equal
percentage
of
the
races
in
the
schools,
that
they
don't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
right?
maybe
i'm
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
--
i
think
--
surely
you're
not
saying,
makes
no
difference
to
the
child?
justice
hugo
l.
black
might
be
separated
from
his
brothers
and
sisters,
he
might
be
transported
15
miles,
they
have
to
go
to
a
school,
one
of
them
is
two
miles
away
and
one
of
them
is
6
miles
away.
i
think,
if
there's
something
to
the
concept
of
the
neighborhood
schools,
that's
worthy
of
consideration
in
this
court,
particularly
and
we
have
to
divide
while
looking
at
maps.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
aren't
they
natural?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean,
they
find
findings
that
they
are
artificial,
the
neighborhoods
are
artificial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
to
you
sir
that
what
i
--
we
understood
is,
we've
been
understating
from
the
first
case,
if
this
plain
discrimination
on
account
of
race
take
on
emphasis,
i
think
we
should
correct
under
the
constitution
but
i
--
it
disturbs
me,
so
i
had
to
challenge
the
whole
arrangement
of
the
living
practice
as
in
the
way
of
life
that
the
people
all
over
this
nation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
have
any
schools
or
people
who
moved
to
places
because
they
are
close
to
a
school?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly
you
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
you
can
show
us,
in
any
of
these
particular
things,
where
the
order
has
been
approved
which
show
in
the
record
discrimination
against
the
race,
then
i'll
be
interested
in
but
i
don't
like
this
whole
theory
trying
to
condemn
a
whole
practice
and
do
away
with
what
i
considered
to
be
a
valuable
part
of
our
concise
--
i
believe
its
just
traditional,
of
the
neighborhood
school
idea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
perhaps
--
