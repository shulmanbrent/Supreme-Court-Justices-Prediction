i
just
looked
at
it
within
the
15
minutes
and
thought
i
had
carefully
verified
this
citation.
the
legal
issue
in
this
case
is
much
like
that
in
the
preceding
case
except
that
the
question
arises
under
a
different
statute.
this
is
a
criminal
case.
it
comes
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
singe-judge
district
court
for
the
central
to
california
which
dismissed
the
indictment
on
the
ground
of
the
statute
under
which
it
was
brought
is
unconstitutional.
the
statutory
provision
here
involved
is
section
1461
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code
which
is
set
forth
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
this
makes
guilty
of
a
crime
any
person
who
knowingly
uses
the
mail
for
sending
non
mailable
matter
and
that
term
is
defined
to
include
every
obscene,
lewd,
lascivious,
indecent,
filthy
or
vile
article,
matter,
thing,
device,
or
substance.
the
indictment
charges
a
violation
of
section
1461
in
three
counts.
although
the
appendix
contains
some
other
material,
particularly
the
text
of
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant.
i
believe
that
the
only
matters
that
are
before
the
court
are
these
three
counts
of
the
indictment,
very
brief
paragraphs
and
a
motion
to
dismiss.
this
motion
was
filed
on
the
ground
that
section
1461
is
unconstitutional
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied.
the
government
stipulated
that
the
booklet
which
was
the
subject
of
count
three
had
been
ordered
by
a
postal
inspector
who
was
an
adult
and
that
it
had
no
evidence
that
the
other
two
booklets
had
not
been
solicited
by
adults.
the
court
then
indicated
that
this
stipulation
would
be
regarded
as
having
been
made
as
an
amendment
to
the
indictment
in
response
to
a
bill
of
particulars
to
which
counsel
on
both
sides
concurred
and
we
believe
that
that
brings
the
situation
within
this
court's
fruehauf
decision
in
365
us.
the
court
then
dismissed
the
indictment,
relying
on
stanley
against
georgia
which
it
interpreted
as
establishing
a
right
to
receive
obscene
material.
the
court
found
that
a
necessary
consequence
of
stanley,
that
individuals
cannot
be
restricted
from
distributing
obscene
material
commercially
through
the
mails
to
adults
who
solicit
such
material.
despite
the
express
disavow
in
stanley
of
any
intent
to
impair
the
holding
in
roth
against
the
united
states
which
sustained
a
conviction
under
the
very
statute
involved
here.
the
court
dismissed
the
indictment
as
applied
in
this
particular
prosecution
and
this
direct
appeal
followed
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
as
it
the
stood.
this
case
involves
the
power
of
congress
to
prohibit
use
of
the
mails
for
commercial
distribution
of
obscene
matter.
under
the
constitution,
congress
is
given
power
to
established
post
offices
and
post
roads
and
also
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations
and
among
the
several
states.
this
court
has
consistently
upheld
the
power
of
congress.
acting
under
these
powers
to
enact
measures
designed
in
the
judgment
of
congress
to
promote
the
public
health
morals
and
welfare.
it
is
nearly
a
hundred
years
since
this
court
upheld
the
validity
of
the
statute
which
prohibited
the
sending
of
lottery
tickets
through
the
mails
and
in
doing
so
the
court
like
in
that
statute
to
the
one
then
in
effect,
which
prohibited
the
mailing
of
obscene
matters.
only
15
years
ago
in
the
roth
case,
this
court
held
constitutional,
the
very
statute
which
is
challenged
here,
section
1461
of
title
18.
indeed
the
factual
situation
in
the
roth
case
is
extremely
close
to
that
involved
here
as
two
of
the
items
in
roth
had
been
mailed
in
response
to
an
order
from
a
postal
inspector.
nothing
has
happened
since
the
roth
case
to
warrant
the
conclusion
that
this
exercise
of
the
postal
power
by
congress
is
no
longer
proper.
indeed
in
the
stanley
case,
decided
less
than
two
years
ago,
the
court
said,
"roth
and
the
cases
following
that
decision
are
not
impaired
by
today's
holding."
despite
this
clear
statement
in
stanley
the
court
below
held
that
the
result
of
stanley
was
that
an
exception
had
been
made
to
roth
so
that
section
1461
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
case.
it
held
that
stanley
established
the
right
to
receive
from
which
it
concluded
that
there
must
be
a
right
to
send
as
long
as
the
material
was
solicited
by
adults
and
not
directed
to
children
or
to
an
unwilling
public.
that's
in
the
appendix
of
page
13
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
our
argument
on
this
question
is
the
same
as
that
already
submitted
in
the
case
of
the
37
photographs
in
which
the
argument
has
just
been
concluded
and
in
our
brief
and
argument
as
amicus
curiae
in
byrne
against
karalexis,
number
83.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
an
invasion
of
a
man's
privacy
in
his
own
home.
the
defendant
did
not
have
these
materials
for
his
own
edification.
he
is
not
charged
with
having
them.
he
is
charged
with
mailing
them.
he
had
them
for
a
commercial
purpose
and
it
is
not
denied
that
he
deposited
them
in
the
mails.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
i
think
it
would
not
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
commercial
or
private.
it
is
the
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
not
to
persecute
in
cases
where
there
is
purely
private
transmission
of
matter
which
might
be
regarded
as
obscene
as
in
that
case
which
was
decided
in
several
years
ago,
where
a
man
took
the
pictures,
sent
them
to
the
photographic
place
for
development
and
they
were
returned
and
it
is
the
policy
not
to
persecute
in
such
cases.
whether
that
policy
is
required
by
any
constitutional
provision,
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute.
i
can
imagine
situations
where
though
it
is
private,
it
is
done
on
a
fairly
extensive
scale
let
us
say
from
one
club
to
another
where
the
position
there
taken
wouldn't
apply
and
where
our
argument
would
be
that
the
statute
should
apply.
stanley,
we
submit,
did
not
give
any
special
status
to
obscene
material
nor
any
general
protection
to
such
material.
the
protection
there
was
given
to
stanley
and
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home.
in
referring
to
first
amendment
rights,
the
opinion
in
stanley
was
careful
to
associate
those
rights
with
mr.
stanley.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
any
first
amendment
protection
was
given
to
the
material
itself.
indeed,
the
specific
statement
that
roth
and
the
cases
following
it
are
not
impaired,
can
have
significance,
only
as
recognizing
that
the
materials
themselves
are
not
subject
to
protection
and
as
i
mentioned
in
my
argument
in
the
37
photographs
case
this
was
recognized
as
recently
as
last
thursday
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
mailbox
case
where
the
court
referred
to
the
line
which
separates
obscenity
from
constitutionally
protect
to
the
expression.
for
the
purposes
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case,
it
has
been
conceded
that
the
materials
involved
here
are
indeed
obscene
and
thus
under
roth
not
entitled
to
the
first
amendment
protection.
stanley
holds
that
the
state
cannot
inquire
into
the
contents
of
a
man's
library.
for
that
inevitably
involves
supervision
of
the
morality
of
his
own
individual
thoughts,
but
this
does
not
require
it
to
condone
the
distribution
of
the
materials
which
it
legislatively
deems
inimical
to
the
public
welfare.
the
latter
is
a
judgment
which
should
be
left
to
congress,
as
in
the
case
of
delusive
mails
to
defraud
or
for
the
transportation
of
lottery
tickets.
our
submission
is
that
stanley
protects
mr.
stanley,
but
not
materials
and
not
purveyors
of
materials.
stanley
himself
--
itself
affirms
that
it
does
not
impair
roth
and
the
roth
decision
clearly
requires
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
so
far
i
have
argued
these
cases
in
what
might
be
called
the
traditional
way,
but
i
would
like
it
add
a
further
word.
one
of
the
problems
in
this
area
is
the
general
lowering
of
standards,
the
impairment
of
public
taste
which
has
resulted
from
an
inescapable
application
of
a
sort
of
literary
aggressions
of
law
to
get
shots
we
must
go
further
and
further.
that
off
itself
would
be
a
matter
to
work
on,
but
to
say
that
it
is
required
by
the
constitution
is
hard
to
find
in
the
language
of
the
constitution
and
still
harder
to
find
in
this
background
history
and
commonly
accepted
purpose.
i
suggest
that
there
is
not
in
reality
an
affinity
between
tom
payne,
and
sam
adams,
and
john
adams
and
thomas
jefferson
and
the
materials
involved
in
this
case.
the
decisions
of
the
courts
do
not
open
up
the
gates.
they
give
an
aura
of
the
legitimacy
to
the
process.
it
is
commonly
understood
that
"i
am
curious
yellow"
was
approved
by
the
united
states
courts.
the
materials
involved
in
this
case
and
others
like
it
are
delivered
by
the
united
states
post
office
by
a
man
in
a
blue
uniform
with
the
government
seal
on
his
shoulder.
it
is
one
thing
as
far
as
public
standards
and
taste
are
concerned
to
have
this
traffic
going
on.
it
is
quite
another
to
have
it
come
with
the
full
sanction
and
imprimatur
of
the
nation's
courts.
just
last
evening,
i
was
reading
the
current
issue
of
the
saturday
review.
it
has
an
editorial
by
norman
cousins,
entitled
"see
everything,
do
everything,
feel
nothing."
he
says,
one
of
the
busiest
through
fares
in
the
united
states,
new
york’s
42nd
street,
the
final
step
beyond
total
nudity
has
now
been
taken.
to
many
it
is
a
travesty
that
these
result
has
been
achieved
in
the
name
of
the
great
principle
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
cousins
go
on
to
observe
that
defenders
of
the
new
trend
argue
that
questions
of
morality
are
relative
and
that
any
of
adult
should
be
allowed
to
see
and
do
whatever
his
curiosity
or
needs
demand
and
he
continues.
it
is
a
serious
error
to
suppose
that
the
deep
personalization
of
sex
is
unrelated
to
other
things
that
are
happening
to
the
society.
what
is
most
damaging
of
all
is
that
the
process
itself
obscures
what
is
happening
so
that
our
highest
responses
are
being
blunted
without
our
knowing
it.
the
first
amendment
is
one
of
the
great
elements
in
our
constitutional
structure.
like
other
parts
of
the
constitution
it
is
not
simple
in
its
construction
or
operation.
like
other
written
text,
other
problems
in
the
law
we
will
probably
keep
on
searching
for
its
essential
meaning
and
will
inevitably
proceed
by
pricking
out
points
and
by
revising
those
points
through
the
process
of
trial
and
error.
in
recent
years,
we
have
gone
rather
far
down
the
road
of
equating
obscenity
with
freedom
of
expression
in
its
political
and
pamphleteering
fields
with
which
the
founding
fathers
were
concerned.
perhaps
the
answer
in
this
difficult
area
may
become
clear
and
more
intellectually
satisfying
if
we
give
up
the
urge
for
an
absolute
construction
of
the
first
amendment
and
look
again
at
its
origin
and
basically
political
function.
for
these
reasons
we
think
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.

statement
in
stanley
the
court
below
held
that
the
result
of
stanley
was
that
an
exception
had
been
made
to
roth
so
that
section
1461
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
this
case.
it
held
that
stanley
established
the
right
to
receive
from
which
it
concluded
that
there
must
be
a
right
to
send
as
long
as
the
material
was
solicited
by
adults
and
not
directed
to
children
or
to
an
unwilling
public.
that's
in
the
appendix
of
page
13
in
the
district
court's
opinion.
our
argument
on
this
question
is
the
same
as
that
already
submitted
in
the
case
of
the
37
photographs
in
which
the
argument
has
just
been
concluded
and
in
our
brief
and
argument
as
amicus
curiae
in
byrne
against
karalexis,
number
83.
this
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
an
invasion
of
a
man's
privacy
in
his
own
home.
the
defendant
did
not
have
these
materials
for
his
own
edification.
he
is
not
charged
with
having
them.
he
is
charged
with
mailing
them.
he
had
them
for
a
commercial
purpose
and
it
is
not
denied
that
he
deposited
them
in
the
mails.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
mr.
justice
i
think
it
would
not
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
commercial
or
private.
it
is
the
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
not
to
persecute
in
cases
where
there
is
purely
private
transmission
of
matter
which
might
be
regarded
as
obscene
as
in
that
case
which
was
decided
in
several
years
ago,
where
a
man
took
the
pictures,
sent
them
to
the
photographic
place
for
development
and
they
were
returned
and
it
is
the
policy
not
to
persecute
in
such
cases.
whether
that
policy
is
required
by
any
constitutional
provision,
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
statute.
i
can
imagine
situations
where
though
it
is
private,
it
is
done
on
a
fairly
extensive
scale
let
us
say
from
one
club
to
another
where
the
position
there
taken
wouldn't
apply
and
where
our
argument
would
be
that
the
statute
should
apply.
stanley,
we
submit,
did
not
give
any
special
status
to
obscene
material
nor
any
general
protection
to
such
material.
the
protection
there
was
given
to
stanley
and
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
home.
in
referring
to
first
amendment
rights,
the
opinion
in
stanley
was
careful
to
associate
those
rights
with
mr.
stanley.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
any
first
amendment
protection
was
given
to
the
material
itself.
indeed,
the
specific
statement
that
roth
and
the
cases
following
it
are
not
impaired,
can
have
significance,
only
as
recognizing
that
the
materials
themselves
are
not
subject
to
protection
and
as
i
mentioned
in
my
argument
in
the
37
photographs
case
this
was
recognized
as
recently
as
last
thursday
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
mailbox
case
where
the
court
referred
to
the
line
which
separates
obscenity
from
constitutionally
protect
to
the
expression.
for
the
purposes
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
this
case,
it
has
been
conceded
that
the
materials
involved
here
are
indeed
obscene
and
thus
under
roth
not
entitled
to
the
first
amendment
protection.
stanley
holds
that
the
state
cannot
inquire
into
the
contents
of
a
man's
library.
for
that
inevitably
involves
supervision
of
the
morality
of
his
own
individual
thoughts,
but
this
does
not
require
it
to
condone
the
distribution
of
the
materials
which
it
legislatively
deems
inimical
to
the
public
welfare.
the
latter
is
a
judgment
which
should
be
left
to
congress,
as
in
the
case
of
delusive
mails
to
defraud
or
for
the
transportation
of
lottery
tickets.
our
submission
is
that
stanley
protects
mr.
stanley,
but
not
materials
and
not
purveyors
of
materials.
stanley
himself
--
itself
affirms
that
it
does
not
impair
roth
and
the
roth
decision
clearly
requires
reversal
of
the
judgment
below.
so
far
i
have
argued
these
cases
in
what
might
be
called
the
traditional
way,
but
i
would
like
it
add
a
further
word.
one
of
the
problems
in
this
area
is
the
general
lowering
of
standards,
the
impairment
of
public
taste
which
has
resulted
from
an
inescapable
application
of
a
sort
of
literary
aggressions
of
law
to
get
shots
we
must
go
further
and
further.
that
off
itself
would
be
a
matter
to
work
on,
but
to
say
that
it
is
required
by
the
constitution
is
hard
to
find
in
the
language
of
the
constitution
and
still
harder
to
find
in
this
background
history
and
commonly
accepted
purpose.
i
suggest
that
there
is
not
in
reality
an
affinity
between
tom
payne,
and
sam
adams,
and
john
adams
and
thomas
jefferson
and
the
materials
involved
in
this
case.
the
decisions
of
the
courts
do
not
open
up
the
gates.
they
give
an
aura
of
the
legitimacy
to
the
process.
it
is
commonly
understood
that
"i
am
curious
yellow"
was
approved
by
the
united
states
courts.
the
materials
involved
in
this
case
and
others
like
it
are
delivered
by
the
united
states
post
office
by
a
man
in
a
blue
uniform
with
the
government
seal
on
his
shoulder.
it
is
one
thing
as
far
as
public
standards
and
taste
are
concerned
to
have
this
traffic
going
on.
it
is
quite
another
to
have
it
come
with
the
full
sanction
and
imprimatur
of
the
nation's
courts.
just
last
evening,
i
was
reading
the
current
issue
of
the
saturday
review.
it
has
an
editorial
by
norman
cousins,
entitled
"see
everything,
do
everything,
feel
nothing."
he
says,
one
of
the
busiest
through
fares
in
the
united
states,
new
york’s
42nd
street,
the
final
step
beyond
total
nudity
has
now
been
taken.
to
many
it
is
a
travesty
that
these
result
has
been
achieved
in
the
name
of
the
great
principle
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
cousins
go
on
to
observe
that
defenders
of
the
new
trend
argue
that
questions
of
morality
are
relative
and
that
any
of
adult
should
be
allowed
to
see
and
do
whatever
his
curiosity
or
needs
demand
and
he
continues.
it
is
a
serious
error
to
suppose
that
the
deep
personalization
of
sex
is
unrelated
to
other
things
that
are
happening
to
the
society.
what
is
most
damaging
of
all
is
that
the
process
itself
obscures
what
is
happening
so
that
our
highest
responses
are
being
blunted
without
our
knowing
it.
the
first
amendment
is
one
of
the
great
elements
in
our
constitutional
structure.
like
other
parts
of
the
constitution
it
is
not
simple
in
its
construction
or
operation.
like
other
written
text,
other
problems
in
the
law
we
will
probably
keep
on
searching
for
its
essential
meaning
and
will
inevitably
proceed
by
pricking
out
points
and
by
revising
those
points
through
the
process
of
trial
and
error.
in
recent
years,
we
have
gone
rather
far
down
the
road
of
equating
obscenity
with
freedom
of
expression
in
its
political
and
pamphleteering
fields
with
which
the
founding
fathers
were
concerned.
perhaps
the
answer
in
this
difficult
area
may
become
clear
and
more
intellectually
satisfying
if
we
give
up
the
urge
for
an
absolute
construction
of
the
first
amendment
and
look
again
at
its
origin
and
basically
political
function.
for
these
reasons
we
think
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
