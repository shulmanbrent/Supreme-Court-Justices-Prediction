i
don't
see
how
there's
any,
any,
any
contradiction
between
reading
the
second
clause
as
a...
as
a
personal
guarantee
and
reading
the
first
one
as
assuring
the
existence
of
a
militia,
not
necessarily
a
state-managed
militia
because
the
militia
that
resisted
the
british
was
not
state-managed.
but
why
isn't
it
perfectly
plausible,
indeed
reasonable,
to
assume
that
since
the
framers
knew
that
the
way
militias
were
destroyed
by
tyrants
in
the
past
was
not
by
passing
a
law
against
militias,
but
by
taking
away
the
people's
weapons...
that
was
the
way
militias
were
destroyed.
the
two
clauses
go
together
beautifully:
since
we
need
a
militia,
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed.
justice

blackstone
thought
it
was
important.
he
thought
the
right
of
self-defense
was
inherent,
and
the
framers
were
devoted
to
blackstone.
joseph
story,
the
first
commentator
on
the
constitution
and
a
member
of
this
court,
thought
it
was
a
personal
guarantee.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
got
nothing
at
all,
not
everything
they
wanted.
they
got
nothing
at
all.
so
long
as
it
was
up
to
the
federal
government
to
regulate
the
militia
and
to
assure
that
they
were
armed,
the
federal
government
could,
could
disband
the
state
militias.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what,
what
was
the
function
served
by
the
second
amendment
as
far
as
the
militia
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
as
i
recall
the
legislation
against
scottish
highlanders
and
against...
against
roman
catholics
did
use
the
term...
forbade
them
to
keep
and
bear
arms,
and
they
weren't
just
talking
about
their
joining
militias;
they
were
talking
about
whether
they
could
have
arms.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dellinger,
let's
come
back
to
your
description
of
the
opinion
below
as
allowing
armor-piercing
bullets
and
machine
guns.
i
didn't
read
it
that
way.
i
thought
the
opinion
below
said
it
had
to
be
the
kind
of
weapon
that
was
common
for
the
people--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
common
for
the
people
to
have.
and
i
don't
know...
i
don't
know
that
a
lot
of
people
have
machine
guns
or
armor-piercing
bullets.
i
think
that's
quite
unusual.
but
having
a
pistol
is
not
unusual.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
people
in
the
country?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
common.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
a
law
on
the
carrying
of
concealed
weapons,
which
would
include
pistols,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
means
"well
trained",
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
"well
regulated"
mean
"well
trained"?
it
doesn't
mean...
it
doesn't
mean
"massively
regulated".
it
means
"well
trained".
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't...
wasn't
it
the
case
that
the
banning
of
arms
on
the
part
of
the
scottish
highlanders
and
of
catholics
in
england
used
the
term,
forbade
them
to
"bear
arms"?
it
didn't
mean
that
could
just
not
join
militias;
it
meant
they
couldn't
carry
arms.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
freedom
of
speech
that
was
referred
to
in
the
constitution
was
also
"the"
freedom
of
speech,
which
referred
to
the
pre-existing
freedom
of
speech.
and
there
were
indeed
some
restrictions
on
that
such
as
libel
that
you
were
not
allowed
to
do.
and
yet
we've
never
held
that
simply
because
it
was
pre-existing
and
that
there
were
some
regulations
upon
it,
that
we
would
not
use
strict
scrutiny.
we
certainly
apply
it
to
freedom
of
speech,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
like
libel.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
what
would
that
be...
that
you
can,
if
you
have
time,
when
you
hear
somebody
crawling
in
your...
your
bedroom
window,
you
can
run
to
your
gun,
unlock
it,
load
it
and
then
fire?
is
that
going
to
be
the
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
opinion
also,
it
didn't
use
the
militia
prologue
to
say
it's
only
the
kind
of
weapons
that
would
be
useful
in
militia,
and
that
are
commonly...
commonly
held
today.
is
there
any
federal
exclusion
of
weapons
that
applies
to
weapons
that
are
commonly
held
today?
i
don't
know
what
you're
worried
about.
machine
guns,
what
else?
armored
bullets,
what
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
passage
doesn't
mean
once
it's
an
arm
in
the
dictionary
definition
of
arms.
once
it's
an
arm
in
the
specialized
sense
that
the
opinion
referred
to
it,
which
is...
which
is
the
type
of
a
weapon
that
was
used
in
militia,
and
it
is...
it
is
nowadays
commonly
held.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
read
it
that
way,
i
don't
see
why
you
have
a
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
talk
a
little
slower;
i'm
not
following
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
to
say
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
shows
that
maybe
you're
being
unrealistic
in
thinking
that
the
second
clause
is
not
broader
than
the
first.
it's
not
at
all
uncommon
for
a
legislative
provision
or
a
constitutional
provision
to
go
further
than
is
necessary
for
the
principal
purpose
involved.
the
principal
purpose
here
is
the
militia,
but
the...
but
the
second
clause
goes
beyond
the
militia
and
says
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
now,
you
may
say
the
kind
of
arms
is
colored
by
the
militia.
but
it
speaks
of
the
right
of
the
people.
so
why
not
acknowledge
that
it's...
it's
broader
than
the
first
clause?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
even
agree
that
massachusetts
was
subject
to
the
second
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
time
we're
talking
about,
the
firearms
in
the
home
ordinance,
when
was
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
useful
for
such
purposes
as
what
"keep
and
bear
arms"
means
and
things
of
that
sort.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
certainly
didn't
want
to
preserve
the
kind
of
militia
that
america
had,
which
was
a
militia
separate
from
the
state,
separate
from
the
government,
which
enabled
the
revolt
against
the
british.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
put
it
that
way.
you
would
just
say
it
is
not
being
infringed
if
reasonable
limitations
are
placed
upon
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
the
more
reason
to
allow
a

to
have
a

turn
on

so
somebody--
justice

--you

you
can't

more

you
would

justice

--you

that's
it.

applied

seeking,
on

grounds,
to
enjoin
the

from
enforcing
the

as

in
an

filed
with

we
affirm
the

of

we
hold
that
the
second

guarantees
an
individual
right
to
have
unused

for

defense
in

and
that
the
district's
handgun
ban
as
well
as
its
requirement
that
firearms
in

be
rendered
inoperative,
violates
that
right.
our
opinion
is
very
lengthy
examining
in
detail,
the
text
and
history
of
the
second
amendment.
this
summary
that
i'm
giving
will
state
little
more
than
the
conclusions.
if
you
want
to
check
their
validity
against
the
dissents'
contrary
claims,
you
will
have
to
read
some
154
pages
of
opinions.
the
second
amendment
provides
"a
well
regulated
militia,
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state,
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms,
shall
not
be
infringed.”
the
interpretive
difficulty
and
what
causes
some
people
to
think
that
it
confers
only
a
collective,
rather
than
an
individual
right,
and
others
including
the
petitioners
here
to
think
that
it
isn't
individual
right
but
only
to
keep
and
bear
arms
for
service
in
a
militia.
the
interpretive
difficulty
that
produces
those
positions
is
of
course
the
prologue,
a
well
regulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state.
it's
a
standard
principle
of
interpretation
and
was
in
1791
that
a
prologue
cannot
limit
the
scope
of
the
operative
text
which
often
goes
beyond
the
narrow
purpose
set
forth
in
a
prologue.
it
would
be
peculiar,
however,
for
the
prologue
positively
to
contradict
the
text.
so,
we
examine
first
the
operative
portion
of
the
amendment,
namely,
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed.
we
conclude
after
examining
many
uses
of
keep
arms
and
bear
arms,
contemporaneous
with
and
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
second
amendment
that
it
means
pretty
much
what
it
means
today
to
have
and
carry
weapons.
those
old
sources
refute
the
notion
that
bear
arms
alone
or
keep
in
bear
arms
in
combination
has
an
exclusively
military
connotation.
to
be
sure
when
one
was
a
soldier,
he
bore
arms,
but
one
could
bear
arms
without
being
a
soldier.
the
same
conclusion
that
the
phrase
does
not
refer
to
military
service
is
demanded
by
the
fact
that
it
was
universally
understood
that
the
second
amendment
incorporated
in
to
the
federal
constitution,
a
preexisting
right
of
englishman
set
forth
in
the
1689
english
bill
of
rights,
that's
why
it
reads
shall
not
be
infringed,
the
right
shall
not
be
infringed,
referring
to
a
preexisting
right
and
everybody
agrees
with
that.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
english
right
was
an
individual
right
to
have
and
carry
arms.
we
then
turn
to
the
prologue
to
see
if
it
is
incompatible
with
the
interpretation
we
have
given
the
operative
clause,
it
is
not.
in
fact,
that
interpretation
that
she
is
the
object
of
the
prologue
more
effectively
than
would
a
mere
right
to
have
and
bear
arms
in
an
organized
militia.
the
militia
consisted
of
all
male
citizens
capable
of
military
service.
that
was
thought
to
be
a
protection
against,
not
only
attack
from
abroad,
but
tyranny
at
home.
in
the
events
that
had
given
rise
to
the
english
bill
of
rights,
the
stuart
kings
had
not
abolished
the
people's
militia,
but
had
simply
taken
away
the
people's
arms
or
the
arms
of
their
opponents,
leaving
in
place
only
a
standing
army
and
a
select
militia
dominated
by
their
own
supporters.
the
lesson
learned,
if
the
people
cannot
have
arms,
there
will
be
no
people's
militia.
that
perception
is
what
joins
the
two
part
of
--
the
two
parts
of
the
second
amendment.
the
mere
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
in
a
state
organized
militia
does
not
solve
the
problem
because
of
the
state
court
like
the
stuart
kings
limit
the
organized
militia
to
its
own
people.
so,
what
the
second
amendment
means
is
since
we
need
a
people's
militia,
the
people
will
not
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
this
interpretation
is
confirmed
by
analogous
arms
bearing
rights
in
state
constitutions
that
preceeded
and
immediately
followed
the
adoption
of
the
second
amendment.
of
the
four
states
that
had
analogues
to
the
federal
second
amendment
before
the
constitution
was
ratified,
two
clearly
conferred
individual
rights
unconnected
to
militia
service
specifying
the
people's
right
to
bear
arms
for
their
own
defense
and
the
most
likely
reading
is
that
the
other
two
also
secured
an
individual
right
to
bear
arms
for
defensive
purposes.
similarly
of
the
nine
states
--
of
the
nine
state
analogues
to
the
second
amendment
that
were
adopted
between
1789
and
1820,
seven
referred
to
the
people's
right
to
bear
arms
in
defense
of
themselves
and
the
state
or
to
the
citizens
right
to
bear
arms
in
defense
of
himself
and
the
state.
the
final
two
of
those
nine
--
of
those
nine
were
ambiguous
but
were
interpreted
by
the
state
courts
to
confer
an
individual
right
to
bear
arms
for
lawful
purposes.
our
opinion
then
looks
at
legal
interpretations
of
the
second
amendment
from
immediately
after
its
ratification
through
the
19th
century.
we
find
that
that
scholars,
including
the
most
famous
ones,
tucker,
rolls,
storey
and
cooley,
the
adjudicated
cases,
congressional
legislation
and
the
statements
of
congressional
legislators,
universally,
took
the
right
to
be
a
personal
one
unconnected
to
militia
service.
the
one
exception
is
a
minor
scholar
who
acknowledged
that
his
view
had
been
rejected.
as
one
might
expect,
after
the
civil
war,
the
right
of
the
former
slaves,
a
new
freemen
to
bear
arms
was
a
significant
issue.
let
me
read
from
a
joint
congressional
report
dated
1866.
in
some
parts
of
south
carolina,
armed
parties
are
without
proper
authority,
engaged
in
seizing
all
firearms
found
in
the
hands
of
freemen.
such
conduct
is
in
clear
and
direct
violation
of
their
personal
rights
as
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
declares
that
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed.
the
congressional
act
creating
the
freedmen's
bureau
on
july
16,
1866
stated
the
right
to
have
full
and
equal
benefit
of
all
laws
in
proceedings
concerning
personal
liberty
and
personal
security
including
the
constitutional
right
to
bear
arms
shall
be
secured
to
and
enjoyed
by
all
the
citizens
without
respect
to
race
or
color
or
previous
condition
of
slavery.
it
was
good
to
have
a
gun
when
--
when
the
clansmen
came.
our
opinion
next
turns
to
whether
any
prior
decisions
of
this
court
preclude
the
interpretation
we
have
just
described.
we
conclude
that
none
does.
i
will
only
describe
one
of
those
cases
on
which
the
dissent
places
its
principle
reliance
and
that
is
our
decision
in
united
states
versus
miller
rendered
in
1939.
the
judgment
in
that
case
upheld
against
a
second
amendment
challenge,
two
men's
federal
convictions
for
transporting
an
unregistered
sawed

act.
it
is
entirely
clear
that
the
court's
basis
for
saying
that
the
second
amendment
did
not
prevent
the
conviction
was
not
that
the
defendants
were
bearing
arms
privately
rather
than
in
a
militia,
rather
it
was
that
the
type
of
weapon
that
issued
was
not
illegible
for
second
amendment
protection.
"in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
tending
to
show
that
the
possession
or
use
of
a
short
barreled
shotgun
at
this
time
has
some
reasonable
relationship
to
the
preservation
or
efficiency
of
a
well
regulated
militia,
we
cannot
say
that
the
second
amendment
guarantees
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
such
an
instrument."
certainly,
the
court
continued,
“it
is
not
within
judicial
notice
that
this
weapon
is
any
part
of
the
ordinary
military
equipment
or
that
its
use
could
contribute
to
the
common
defense."
beyond
that,
the
opinion
provided
no
explanation
of
the
content
of
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms.
this
holding
is
not
only
consistent
with
but
positively
suggests
that
the
second
amendment
confers
a
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
for
lawful
private
purposes.
had
the
court
believed
that
the
second
amendment
protects
only
those
service
--
those
serving
in
the
militia,
it
would
have
been
odd
to
examine
the
character
of
the
weapon
rather
than
simply
note
that
the
two
crooks
were
not
militia
men.
miller
stands
only
for
the
proposition
that
the
second
amendment
right,
whatever
its
nature,
extends
only
to
certain
types
of
weapons.
it
is
particularly
wrong
headed
to
read
miller
for
more
than
what
it
said
because
the
case
did
not
even
purport
to
be
a
thorough
examination
of
the
second
amendment.
the
respondent
made
no
appearance
in
the
case,
neither
filing
a
brief
nor
appearing
at
oral
argument,
the
court
heard
from
no
one
but
the
government,
reason
enough,
one
would
think
not
to
make
that
case
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
this
court's
consideration
of
the
second
amendment.
the
government's
miller
brief
provided
scant
discussion
of
the
history
of
the
second
amendment
and
the
court
was
presented
with
no
counter
discussion.
as
for
the
text
of
the
court's
opinion,
that
--
as
for
the
text
of
the
court's
opinion
itself,
that
discusses
none
of
the
history
of
the
second
amendment.
it
assumes
from
the
prologue
that
the
amendment
was
designed
to
preserve
the
militia
which
we
do
not
dispute
and
then
we
view
some
historical
materials
dealing
with
the
nature
of
the
militia
and
in
particular
with
the
nature
of
the
arms
their
members
were
expected
to
posses,
not
a
word,
not
a
word
about
the
history
of
the
second
amendment.
the
next
section
of
our
opinion
points
out
that
like
most
rights,
the
second
amendment
right
is
not
unlimited.
it
is
not
a
right
to
keep
and
carry
any
weapon
whatsoever,
in
any
manner
whatsoever,
and
for
whatever
purpose.
for
example,
concealed
weapons
prohibitions
have
been
upheld
under
the
amendment
or
state
analogues.
our
opinion
should
not
be
taken
to
cast
doubt
on
long
standing
prohibitions
on
the
possession
of
firearms
by
felons
and
the
mentally
ill
or
laws
forbidding
the
carrying
of
firearms
in
sensitive
places
such
as
schools
and
government
buildings,
or
laws
imposing
conditions
and
qualifications
on
the
commercial
sale
of
arms.
miller
is
holding
that
the
sorts
of
weapons
protected
are
those
"in
common
use
of
the
time,"
finds
support
in
the
historical
tradition
of
prohibiting
the
carrying
of
dangerous
and
unusual
weapons.
we
make
no
attempt
to
provide
and
no
excuse
for
not
providing
extensive
historical
justification
for
those
regulations
of
the
right
that
we
describe
as
permissible
since
this
case
represents
the
court's
first
in-depth
examination
of
the
second
amendment,
one
should
not
expect
it
to
clarify
the
entire
field.
there
will
be
time
enough
to
expound
upon
the
historical
justifications
for
these
exceptions
we
have
mentioned
if
and
when
those
exceptions
come
before
us.
finally,
we
come
to
our
disposition
of
the
case,
the
district's
handgun
ban
and
the
trigger
lock
requirement,
at
least
as
applied
to
immediate
self
defense
which
is
all
that
the
respondent
asked
for,
violates
the
second
amendment.
the
district's
total
ban
on
handgun
possession
in
the
home
amounts
to
prohibition
all
of
--
of
an
entire
class
of
arms
that
americans
overwhelmingly
choose
for
the
lawful
purpose
of
self
defense.
under
any
of
the
standards
of
scrutiny,
the
court
has
applied
to
enumerated
constitutional
rights,
this
prohibition
in
the
place
where
the
need
for
lawful
defense
of
self,
family
and
property
is
most
acute
would
fail
constitutional
muster.
similarly,
the
requirement
that
any
lawful
firearm
in
the
home
be
disassembled
or
bound
by
a
trigger
lock
makes
it
impossible
for
citizens
to
use
arms
for
the
core
lawful
purpose
of
self
defense
and
is
hence
unconstitutional,
because
heller
conceded
at
oral
argument
that
the
d.c.
licensing
law
is
permissible
if
it
is
not
enforced
arbitrarily
and
capriciously,
the
court
assumes
that
a
license
will
satisfy
his
prayer
for
reliefs
--
for
relief
and
so
we
do
not
address
the
licensing
requirement.
assuming
he
is
not
disqualified
from
exercising
second
amendment
rights
by
being
a
felon
or
mentally
ill
for
example,
the
district
must
permit
heller
to
register
his
handgun
and
must
issue
him
a
license
to
carry
it
at
home.
we
are
aware
of
the
problem
of
handgun
violence
in
this
country
and
we
take
seriously
the
concerns
raised
by
the
many
amici
who
believe
that
prohibition
of
handgun
ownership
is
a
solution.
the
constitution
leaves
the
district
of
columbia
a
variety
of
tools
for
combating
that
problem
including
some
measures
regulating
handguns,
but
the
second
amendment
necessarily
takes
certain
policy
choices
off
the
table.
these
include
the
absolute
prohibition
of
handguns
held
and
used
for
self
defense
in
the
home.
undoubtedly,
some
think
that
the
second
amendment
is
outmoded
in
a
society
where
our
standing
armies
in
pride
of
our
nation
where
a
well-trained
police
forces
provide
personal
security
and
where
a
gun
violence
is
a
serious
problem,
that
is
perhaps
debatable.
but
what
is
not
debatable
is
that
it
is
not
the
role
of
this
court
to
pronounce
the
second
amendment
extinct.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
souter,
ginsberg
and
breyer
have
joined.
