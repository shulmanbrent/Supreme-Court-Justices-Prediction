mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
clarify
first
the
state's
position
in
the
chianelli
case.
in
the
chianelli
case
there
was
an
attack
upon
the
petit
jury,
not
the
grand
jury
at
all.
now,
the
wilson
case,
of
course,
didn't
deal
with
the
petit
jury
--
jury.
it
dealt
with
the
grand
jury
only.
so
that
the
state's
position
was
that
202
could
be
applied
as
written
to
a
petit
jury.
wilson
held
that
it
could
not
be
applied
to
a
grand
jury
because
if
it
did,
if
it
were
applied
that
way
then
it
would
be
unconstitutional
and
that
it
would
not
allow
a
reasonable
period
or
the
raising
of
federal
points.
i
won't
say
therefore
that
the
state
did
not
abandon
its
position
in
--
in
chianelli
at
all
with
reference
to
the
wilson
case.
we
regard
it
as
a
different
situation
altogether.
that
it
is
possible
to
raise,
to
--
to
say
that
202
applies
to
petit
juries
three
days
after
the
beginning
of
the
term
because
a
man
knows
he's
coming
up
in
that
time
and
has
an
opportunity,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
raise
them.
the
supreme
court
took
position
and
we
disagreed
with
it
that
wilson
should
be
--
that
the
language
in
202
should
be
applied
to
both
petit
and
--
and
grand
juries.
so
that
while
they
disagreed
with
us,
they
affirmed
action.
now,
on
the
wilson
case
as
recently
as
the
chianelli
case
and
all
of
us
know
in
the
chianelli
case.
i
would
like
to
make
this
point
which
i
intend
to
make
a
bit
later.
and
that
is
the
meticulous
concern
of
louisiana
and
its
supreme
court
for
the
protection
of
federal
rights.
you
recall
that
mr.
fust,
a
moment
ago,
read
a
language
from
the
chianelli
case
wherein
the
supreme
court,
going
out
of
its
way,
said,
"well
now,
if
we
are
wrong
about
202
as
to
petit
juries
and
grand
juries,
it's
up
to
the
legislature
to
do
that
but
we
want
to
make
the
caveat
that
they
better
be
careful
to
protect
federal
constitutional
rights.”
i
think
it's
important
because
part
of
the
argument
made
in
this
case
and
in
the
next
case,
principally,
has
to
do
with
the
idea
that
louisiana
in
wilson
was
developing
a
sinister
and
anti-federal
doctrine.
a
doctrine
that
was
intended
as
a
mechanism
to
prevent
the
raising
of
federal
rights
and
we
contend
that
it
--
exactly
the
contrary
is
true.
that
had
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
not
interpreted
202
to
apply
up
to
three
days
at
the
end
of
the
term,
then
they
would
have
found
our
statute
precisely
in
the
position
of
the
statute
in
texas
which
this
court
declared
unconstitutional
some
40
years
ago,
carter
versus
texas,
because
it
didn't
allow
an
opportunity
for
a
person
who
had
been
indicted
after
the
three
days
of
the
--
the
commencement
of
the
term
to
raise
the
point,
of
course.
whereas,
louisiana's
interpretation
of
202
allows
every
person
at
least
three
days.
and
in
many
instances,
of
course,
far
more
because
if
a
person,
let's
say
were
indicted
today
in
november
by
a
grand
jury
whose
term
would
expire
on
march
that
person
will
have
until
three
days
after
the
end
of
the
term
in
march
to
raise
that
point
which
i
submit
to
the
court
is
longer
than
exists
in
many
states
who
cut
off
the
right
to
raise
pleas
at
the
arraignment
part.
so
that
louisiana
a
man
could
be
arraigned.
he
could
file
other
pleas
in
louisiana.
and
yet
he'd
still
have
until
some
date
in
march
if
he
were
indicted
today
to
raise
that
point.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
--
to
say
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
in
general.
in
louisiana,
it's
six
months.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
and,
of
course,
the
petit
term
is
one
month.
but
the
--
then
your
term
is
six
months.
i
have
--
i'm
not
able
to
assist
the
court
with
reference
to
the
others.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that
is
correct.
if
a
person
were
indicted
on
the
first
day
of
the
new
term,
he'd
have
180
days
plus
three.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
which
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
sir.
sir,
i
have
had
research
made
on
comparable
grand
jury
statutes.
and
i've
found
that,
of
course,
about
one-third
of
the
states
don't
require
grand
juries
at
all,
the
indictments
in
capital
cases.
the
general
period
is
arraignment.
that,
you
know,
you
cannot
file
the
attacks
of
this
sought
after
the
plea
in
abatement,
which
is
the
general
common
law
ruling.
now
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
are
drawn
from
the
same
wheel.
the
wheel
is
--
consists
of
1000
names.
and
as
mr.
fust
stated,
that
there
are
negroes
in
the
wheel,
ever
since
pierre
versus
louisiana
which
this
court
decided
some
25
or
so
years
ago.
so
that
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that
is
correct,
sir,
on
1000
names
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
chosen
by
jury
commissioners.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
for
the
grand
jury
term,
i
think
it's
--
there
are
weeks
before
the
term.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
there
is
a
special
drawing
of
75
names
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir.
they're
not
--
the
--
the
petit
juries
are
drawn
by
the
month.
the
15th
of
the
preceding
month,
like
for
instance
for
december,
there
would
be
a
--
a
grand
--
petit
jury
drawn
in
between
the
15th
and
the
20th
of
this
month.
but
its
from
the
same
1000
names,
of
course,
depleted
as
--
as
the
jury
goes
along.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
it
must
be
1000
names
before
that
you
commence
drawing
any
kind
of
a
jury.
now,
of
course,
if
you
draw
--
we
have
six
sections.you
draw
150
names
to
for
each
the
jury,
that's
going
to
reduce
that
wheel.
then
immediately
at
--
thereafter
and
before
a
new
drawing
takes
place,
there
is
--
the
wheel
is
brought
up
to
at
least
1000.
it
can
be
over.
but
it
must
be
at
least
--
and
no
--
no
drawing
can
commence
until
there
are
1000
names
in
the
wheel.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
the
wheel
is
made
up
by
jury
commissioners
appointed
by
the
governor.
and
they
have
authority
and
as
far
as
i
know,
they
exercise
it
to
investigate
the
qualifications
of
jurors
prior
to
their
--
of
putting
--
putting
them
in
the
wheel.
and
as
i
say,
there's
been
no
attack
of
some
--
of
that
system
since
pierre
versus
louisiana
in
which
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
may
3rd,
1954.
i
was
not
involved
in
this
case
in
its
earlier
stages.
i
did
argue
it
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
think
that
mr.
schreiber
mentioned
the
--
the
ones
that
have.
there
had
been
several
attacks.
and
mr.
schreiber
correctly
pointed
out
that
judge
o'hara
some
years
ago
actually
threw
one
out.
other
than
that,
insofar
as
i
know,
there's
never
been
a
holding
by
the
supreme
court
that
this
is
wrong.
and
there's
no
record
in
this
case
that
the
system
is
wrong
at
all.
of
course
we
never
got
to
that
because
the
lower
court
up
--
upheld
the
--
upheld
the
demurrer
on
the
state.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
it
comes
about
--
i
don't
know
how.
let
me
say
this
to
you,
mr.
justice
harlan.
75
names
are
drawn
out
of
the
1000
for
the
grand
jury
per
term.
these
75
names
are
presented
to
the
judge
who
is
going
to
have
control
of
the
jury
for
the
next
six
months
and
they
rotate.
he
chooses,
by
own
discretion,
12
to
serve
as
the
grand
jury.
now,
the
statement
is
made
that
how
--
how
is
it
that
that
there
has
never
been.
actually,
this
record
doesn't
show
that
there
has
never
been.
there's
no
record
to
show
that
there
has
never
been
any
negroes
on
the
grand
jury
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
present
grand
jury
has
two.
it
is
said
and,
of
course,
i
will
try
and
to
believe
it
because
the
people
who
tell
that,
i
think,
they're
reputable
people,
that
there
never
has
been.
but
what
i
don't
know
is
why.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
all
--
that
there
can
be
legitimate
reasons
in
new
orleans
why
the
few
who
appear
among
the
75
by
laws
should
be
excused.
i
don't
know.
perhaps
and
i
don't
think
this
is
a
rash
conclusion.
perhaps
it
isn't.
the
--
the
laboring
class
states
that
they
don't
want
to
be
on
grand
juries.
it's
a
long
term.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
it's
up
to
the
grand
jury.
it
has
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
been
once
a
week
for
the
last
--
since
my
term
for
the
last
18
months
and
sometimes
twice.
but
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
i
am
not
satisfied.
and
i
do
not
admit
that
that
system
is
wrong.
i'm
aware
of
hernandez
versus
texas
about
a
presumption
of
--
that
when
there
have
been
no
grand
jurors
for
some
long
period
of
time
that
that
systematic
exclusion
must
exist.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
that's
a
rebuttable
presumption
and
i
think
the
state
can
rebut
it.
i
don't
know.
i
have
not
--
i
have
not
had
occasion
to
--
to
do
so.
i'm
aware
that
in
hernandez,
this
court
said
that
the
fact
that
commissioners
who
had
appointed
the
grand
jury
attested
that
they
had
not
systematically
excluded
--
would
not
--
this
court
wouldn't
--
but
wouldn't
observe,
wouldn't
honor
that
statement.
but
i
am
trying
to
believe
that
this
court
might
well
honor
a
statement
by
the
general
bench.
all
of
the
bench
of
the
louisiana
criminal
district
court
to
the
effect
that
they
have
not
--
conscientiously
they
have
not
excluded
negroes
systematically.
and
that
--
that
it
is
a
fact
that
in
the
past
years,
there
have
been
none
if
that
is
so,
because
they
didn't
want
to
serve
or
they
didn't
have
the
qualifications
of
some
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
oh,
i
suppose
so,
yes.
that
is
to
say
the
--
the
motion
i
suppose
states
a
cause
of
action
which
by
our
demurrer
we
admit
but
only
for
the
purpose
of
the
demurrer.
louisiana
would
want
to
counter
that.
the
facts
read
it
but
i
must
confess
on
the
cases
of
the
other
states
in
the
light
of
the
hernandez
doctrine
which
establishes,
however,
merely
a
prima
facie
presumption
which
can
be,
i
believe,
upset
in
which
i
think
louisiana
could
overcome.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
do
not
know
that.
all
i
can
say
is
that
that
thousand
has
been
approved
by
this
court.
this
court
threw
it
out
in
--
in
pierre
versus
louisiana.
and
then
the
system
was
changed
and
it's
--
it's
been
sanctioned.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that
would
be
a
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
must
say
that
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
it.
and
i
say
that
because
of
this
reason.
since
i
have
been
there
which
is
so
--
there
have
been
four
grand
juries
since
i
have
been
there.
of
the
75
and
i'm
--
i'm
just
thinking
back.
there
have
been
between
8
and
12
of
the
75
negroes
since
i
have
been
there.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
how's
that,
sir?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
on
the
75.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
no,
sir,
because
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
i
believe
this
is
cutoff
by
plea.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
oh,
he
made
the
offer
to
--
to
support
his
--
his
plea.
oh,
yes.
there
was
an
offer
to
support
his
plea
with
them.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
--
i
don't
recall
that
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
it
might
be
one
or
other.
let
me
pass
on
now
and
say
this.
that
louisiana,
in
general,
accepts
the
statement
of
the
case
as
presented
by
mr.
fust
and
mr.
schreiber
with
at
least
three
observations
with
reference
to
it.
the
state
does
not
see
that
there
has
ever
been
any
doubt
in
this
case
concerning
the
date
of
mr.
schreiber's
appointment.
now,
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
transcript
on
page
--
on
page
34
and
35
when
the
evidence
is
taken
on
the
point,
the
very
bottom
of
page
34,
when
mr.
schreiber
said
that
his
recollection
was
a
bit
hazy
about
the
matter
of
the
judging
(inaudible),
my
recollection
is
not.
and
then
proceed
to
give
what
his
recollection
was
and
it's
on
page
35.
and
it
is
to
the
effect
that
on
february
25th,
he
first
spoke
to
mr.
schreiber
about
it.
and
that
he
appointed
him
on
march
2nd.
but
there's
one
other
point
that
has
not
yet
been
brought
out.
and
that
is
according
to
judge
hertz
he
spoke
to
mr.
schreiber
in
the
interval
between
february
23rd
and
march
2nd.
so
that
it's
hard
to
see
that
mr.
schreiber
wasn't
aware
of
--
of
this
impending
matter.
now,
from
february
23rd,
he's
been
refreshed
about
it
again
in
the
interval.
and
finally
a
formal
appointment
on
the
23rd.
now,
the
point
has
been
made
incidentally
and
i
refer
again
to
the
record
on
page
47,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
had
no
doubt
about
this
question
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
all.
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
bottom
page
of
47,
the
court
of
louisiana
says
this.
the
counsel
insists
that
the
statute
as
interpreted
as
unfair
and
so
forth.
there
might
have
been
some
merit
in
this
postulation
if
the
predicate
upon
which
it's
based
were
valid,but
the
minutes
of
the
court
show
that
appellant's
chief
counsel,
chief
if
you
noticed,
mr.
schreiber,
an
attorney
of
experience
in
criminal
cases
was
appointed
by
the
judge
to
represent
him
on
march
2nd,
1953
(not
on
march
5th
as
counsel
contend).
the
judge
of
course,
judge
hertz,
also
said
that
in
his
per
curiam.
so
that
you've
got
the
judge
saying
that
in
the
testimony.
you've
got
him
affirm
within
his
per
curiam.
you
have
the
state
of
louisiana
supreme
court
accepting
that
as
a
fact
in
the
case.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
was
going
to
address
myself
to
that
but
i'll
do
it
now.
i
have
only
been
there
18
months.
and
i
can
state
to
the
court
i
do
not
know
of
such
custom.
i
do
not
say
it
doesn't
exist.
perhaps
it
does.
i
do
say
this.
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
such
a
custom
and
i
will
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
know,
sir.
you
asked
me
if
i
knew
the
custom,
i
must
truthfully
say
i
never
heard
any.
but
if
there
maybe
my
own
ignorance
you
see
i
wouldn't
come
into
contact
with
these
appointments
and
all
of
it.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
no,
sir,
because
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
the
point
was
first
raised
here.
i
do
not
know
if
there
was
such
a
custom.
i
do
know
it's
not
in
this
record.
and
two
other
things
i
know.
that
there
is
no
statute
which
requires
service
of
the
notice,
nor
is
any
court
rule
on
the
subject.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
the
court's
minutes
do,
also.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
is
in
the
record.
just
at
the
moment,
i
may
not
be
able
to
find
it.
it
would
--
it
would
appear
in
the
minutes
and
also
it
would
appear
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
right.
now,
while
i'm
on
that
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
is.
also,
one
was
mr.
becker
as
--
who
was
the
counsel
in
this
case.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir.
on
page
3
of
the
--
of
the
transcript.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
mr.
becker
was
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
for
the
state.
he
was
for
the
state.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
he
was
for
the
state.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
he's
--
he
was
assistant
attorney
general.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
he
is
the
same
man.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
it.
and
i'll
say
it
further,
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
the
familiarity.
they
remember
the
bar
with
that
question
including
the
members
all
who
were
representing
the
defendants
in
this
case.
it's
a
common
thing.
and
has
been
since
before
wilson,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
with
respect
to
mr.
fust's
role
in
the
matter,
i
mean
mr.
fust
admits
but
i
want
to
document
the
point
by
referring
to
page
37
of
the
transcript.
that
mr.
fust
was
appointed
to
assist
mr.
schreiber,
not
as
main
counsel
at
all
but
to
assist
him.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
he
was
--
i
--
when
was
he
told
that
he
was
to
assist?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
do
not
know.
the
--
the
judge
indicates
that
--
well,
i
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
the
judge
says
this,
"with
all
due
respect
to
you
mr.
fust,
i
appointed
you
to
assist
him."
that
is
schreiber,
not
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
agree.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
that's
correct.
but
i'll
say
this
that
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
answered
that
point
on
page
47
by
saying
after
all
the
man
is
not
entitled
to
two
lives
within
this
case.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
how's
that?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
to
assist
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
but
i
--
i
don't
think
that
the
position
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
should
be
taken
now.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
schreiber?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that
is
so.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
i
think
you'll
find
that
on
page
35
where
judge
hertz
gives
his
version
of
the
appointment
set
up.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
oh,
yes.
he
was
appointed
in
the
record.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
think
he
was
ever
served
with
the
notice
but
he
served.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
let
look
that
up
for
you.
i
think
it
does,
if
your
honor
please.
i
don't
see
a
minute.
actually,
my
assistant
here
told
me
he
doesn't.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
see
it,
your
honor.
it
may
--
it
may
had
been.
if
we
discover
it
in
--
in
a
few
moments,
i'll
point
it
out.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
that
it
does
then.
what
it
recognized
is
fust
as
being
in
the
case
if
we
have
that.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
but
there
is
--
there
is
no
amended
entry.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
there
is
no
amended
entry
nor
does
it
appear
on
the
reverse
of
the
indictment
which
is
--
would
give
mr.
fust's
formal
appointment.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
to
assist
you.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
the
judge
says
this
about
it.
i
don't
--
and
that's
on
page
35.
i
don't
remember
the
time.
that
was
between
the
first
discussion
on
march
2nd
and
i
told
him
that's,
mr.
schreiber,
in
the
event
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
he
accepted
the
appointment.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
it's
page
35.
it's
judge
hertz's
version
you
see
on
what
happened.
“until
that
in
the
event
he
accepted
the
appointment,
i
would
appoint
him
no
lawyer
because
the
case
was
a
capital
one.”
i'm
not
sure
that
this
is
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
the
record
shows
that.
the
record
shows
the
appointment.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
judge
hertz
says
he
was
appointed
on
that
date.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
now,
that
doesn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
see
any
doubt
until
it's
been
raised
here
that
mr.
schreiber
was
actually
appointed
on
the
2nd.
the
minutes
show
it,
the
back
of
the
indictment
show
it.
judge
hertz
says
so.
his
per
curiam
says
so.
and
the
supreme
court
says
so.
the
supreme
court's,
actually,
by
parenthetical
statement
which
i
read
said
and
not
on
march
5th
as
contended
by
counsel.
they
made
that
finding
of
fact
in
this
case.
it
was
march
2nd.
now,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
one
other
point
before
i
go
into
another
matter.
now,
yesterday,
mr.
justice
reed
asked
the
question.
i
think
it
was
about
mr.
schreiber
as
to
whether
or
not,
as
the
way
i
understood
it,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
point
concerning
effective
counsel
because
you
see
mr.
schreiber
now
says,
well,
even
if
i
was
appointed
on
the
2nd,
i
wasn't
really
effective.
he's
candid
in
saying
so.
i'm
not
so
sure
i
understood
mr.
justice
reed's
question
all
right
or
the
answer.
but
i
think
there's
enough
confusion
at
least
in
my
mind
to
make
this
clarification.
so
far
as
i
know
and
it's
true
that
i've
been
this
case
only
since
its
appeal
in
louisiana.
the
first
time
the
point
was
ever
raised
about
mr.
schreiber
not
being
effective
counsel
was
in
this
court.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
application
for
writs
to
this
court.
and
it's
not
raised
in
their
brief.
yesterday,
for
the
first
time
on
argument,
i
heard
the
--
the
statement
that
we're
now
--
even
if
i
was
appointed
on
march
2nd,
i
really
--
i
really
wasn't
effective.
i
might
say
that
if
the
court
wishes
to
consider
that
point
that
precisely
that
is
involved
in
the
next
case
for
rape
cases
where
this
court
will
be
called
upon
to
state
what
is
effective
counsel.
and
how
we
didn't
have
reply
to
it.
you
see
in
our
briefs
because
it
has
not
been
raised.
but
if
the
court
should
choose
to
--
to
consider
the
point,
we
ask
that
our
argument
in
the
next
case
be
made
applicable
here.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
where
is
lewis,
sir?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
she
was
the
aunt
of
--
of
the
defendant.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
she
was
the
one
you
see
who
was
trying
to
get
money
to
employ
counsel.
she'd
spoken
to
the
judge
on
a
previous
occasion.
and
on
this
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
did
i
not
call
you
up
and
introduced
mr.
schreiber
until
he
--
this
is
the
lawyer
l
appointed
and
she
said
yes.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
it
seems
certainly
he
was
appointed.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
on
march
the
2nd.
now,
i
should
like
to
press
on
to
the
state's
argument
with
respect
to
this
matter.
and
point
out
this.
that
the
only
question
before
this
court,
of
course,
is
whether
wilson
interpreting
202
is
constitutional.
this
court
does
not
have
before
it.
it
couldn't
have
mechanically
the
question
of
whether
the
louisiana
system
of
choosing
grand
jurors
is
valid
because
that
point
is
not
in
the
record.
it
can't
be
passed
on
administratively,
mechanically
in
this
case.
the
only
issue
is,
is
202
as
interpreted
by
wilson
a
constitutional
statute?
now,
i
should
like
to
say
this
about
wilson.
wilson
occurred
15
years
ago.
louisiana
has
been
operating
on
the
wilson
then
for
13
years.
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
court
approved
wilson
in
1943.
and
as
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
if
the
court
will
look
at
our
brief
on
page
6,
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
in
this
court
said
about
the
wilson
doctrine,
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
granted.
and
the
appeal
is
dismissed
that
appearing
for
decisions
based
upon
a
nonfederal
ground
adequate
to
support
it.
in
other
words,
the
court's
interpretation
of
202
has
been
approved
by
this
court.
and
i
submit
that
if
the
wilson
doctrine
is
to
be
inquired
into
it
all,
it
means
an
overruling
of
the
--
of
--
by
this
court
of
its
own
decision
in
its
per
curiam
in
1943.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
that's
right
but
it
--
it
found
no
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
where
is
the
federal
question
now
then?
you
see
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
the
yellow
one.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
say
therefore
that
this
case
could
--
that
this
michel
case
could
very
well
be
decided
on
the
basis
simply
that
there
is
no
federal
question.
that
the
case
rests
upon
an
adequate
state
ground
already
approved
by
this
court.
and
certainly,
we
have
been
operating
under
it
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
for
15
years.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
oh,
yes.
i'm
--
i'm
quite
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
--
think
that's
correct.
so
that
actually
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that
--
that
brings
us
to
the
question
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
under
the
facts
of
this
case
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
there
were
three
days.
in
another
case
that
may
be
25
or
100
or
--
and
still
another
there
may
be
none.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
except
as
that's
so.
but
the
point
has
never
been
made
that
this
application
for
continuance
had
the
effect
of
extending
the
three
days.
i
doubt
it
if
it's
extensible
(inaudible)
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
not
on
this
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that's
correct
but
not
on
this,
with
where
the
three
days
is
well
established,
was
then
and
well
then.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
of
course
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
your
honor
is
making
the
point
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that
this
court
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
of
course
on
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
of
course,
it
may
well
be,
too,
that
judge
hertz
was
familiar
with
this
and
mr.
schreiber
was
familiar
with
this.
both
knew
that
this
was
the
last
day
of
the
--
of
the
court's
term.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
oh,
yes.
i
think
that
if
the
court
has
to
take
it
altogether
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
yes.
i
--
i
--
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
mean
that
this
court
is
bound
to
accept
it.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
of
course,
he'd
been
in
the
case
really
and
assess
since
february
23rd.
but
it
seems
to
be
there's
another
answer
to
that.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
but
he
spoke
to
him
at
first.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
my
point
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
--
my
point
is
that
on
march
the
2nd,
it
was
not
a
new
matter
to
mr.
schreiber.
no,
it
was
a
week
old.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
certainly
the
court
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
certainly,
the
courts
thought
so.
certainly,
the
supreme
court
thought
so.
therefore,
the
question
is,
is
this
court
is
going
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
state
court
on
the
matter
of
fact.
it
must
go
beyond
the
record.
it
must
go
beyond
what
the
supreme
court
had
said.
it
is
true
that,
of
course,
that
if
a
court
or
if
a
state
court
misinterprets
the
facts
and
does
so
for
evasive
purposes,
this
court,
to
avoid
the
presentation
of
constitutional
rights,
of
course,
this
court
can
intervene.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that's
certainly
one
aspect.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that's
a
direct
point
i
made
a
moment
ago.
and
i
submit
that
this
court
in
all
of
the
other
cases
i've
ever
seen
about
the
point,
it's
always
the
followed
the
state
court
on
the
questions
of
fact
unless
it
found
a
sinister,
anti-federal
attitude.
and
i
don't
think
that
exists.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
on
questions
of
fact?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
on
questions
of
fact?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
do
believe
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
do
believe
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
that
if
the
state
or
the
court
refuses
to
follow
facts
to
this
--
there's
one
case
cited
by
the
defendant
exactly
to
that
effect.
one
of
them,
the
missouri
supreme
court
simply
had
no
facts
upon
which
to
base
its
adequate
state
ground.
then
the
supreme
court
of
--
this
--
this
supreme
court
said
we're
going
to
--
we're
going
to
say
this
is
not
an
adequate
state
ground
because
there's
nothing
to
support
it
from
the
record.
now,
of
course
they
didn't
say
that
missouri
was
or
say
dishonest
about
it.
but
it's
close
to
that.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
agree.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that's
certainly
one
position
that
can
be
taken.
and
mind
you
this
court
has
frequently
said
that
they
may
not
agree
with
the
state
setup,
with
the
state
procedure.
they
may
think
it's
not
good
at
all
but
that's
not
the
test.
they
may
prefer
another
way
of
handling
a
certain
point.
that's
not
the
test.
the
test
is
after
all
even
though
you
don't
agree
with
it,
you'd
prefer
a
different
system,
you
might
make
a
different
finding.
nevertheless
is
that
so
little
here
that
it
can
be
said
that
this
bends
constitutional
rights
that
deliberately
were
taken
away
from
him.
i
think
not.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
believe
so
if
your
honor
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
how
is
louisiana
then
to
operate
its
system?
certainly,
no
one
will
fall
with
the
proposition
that
louisiana
has
a
right
to
say
sometimes
that
now
here,
you
cannot
file
pleas
after
this
given
date.
everybody
does
that.
i
mean
procedural
statute
of
--
statutes
of
limitations
and
that's
what
this
is.
they're
common.
i'll
mention
(inaudible)
that
important
rights
are
always
lost
by
any
statute
of
limitation
as
perhaps
they
were
here.
but
this
court
has
always
said
we
will
not
interfere
unless
they're
just
isn't
any
way
to
raise
the
federal
question.
louisiana
has
said
yes,
you
had
three
days.
this
court
must
say
no.
you
did
not
have
three
days.
we
disagree
with
judge
hertz.
we
disagree
with
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
which
addressed
itself
precisely
to
the
question.
parenthetically,
i
have
called
that,
not
as
on
march
5th
as
the
counsel
contend.
louisiana
addressed
itself
directly
to
that
point
and
filed
to
the
contrary.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
no,
sir.
you
mean
that
minute
entry
itself
is
inaccurate?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
don't
believe
it's
inaccurate.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
so
if
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
think
that
if
there
were
overwhelming
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
that
the
minute
entry
was
wrong
then
i
think
that
if
louisiana
had
found
that
the
minute
entry
was
right,
this
court
might
be
entitled
to
intervene.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
think
not.
unless
as
i
say
except
in
the
rare
case
practically
amounting
to
bad
faith
and
evasion.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
think
so.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
think
so.
i
don't
want
to
--
if
--
if
the
court
will
permit
me
to
(inaudible)
that
for
this
reason,
mrs.dupont
here
my
assistant
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
will
handle
that
in
the
next
case.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
will
say,
generally
speaking,
we
are
prepared
to
say
that
non-action
may
be
significance
of
wise
action
in
this
instance.
to
use
mr.
justice
minton's
phrase
in
williams
versus
georgia,
put
a
built-in
error,
don't
raise
it.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
do
not
know
whether
202
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
do
not
know
whether
2
--
2
--
i
do
not
know
whether
--
whether
202
is
absolute.
i
think
that
it
certainly
can
be
argued
that
it
is
because
last
clause
of
202
says
and
if
not
filed
within
the
time
set
by
the
statute,
it
is
waived.
so
that
it
is
questionable,
it
seems
to
me,
whether
a
waiver
is
possible
by
the
--
by
the
states.
but
our
position
is
that
there
was
no
waiver
here.
it
was
not
asked
for
in
that
sense.
i
think
it
would
have
to
be
exact.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
but
we
--
there
are
many
other
objections
that
could
be
raised,
you
see,
until
arraignment.
but
this
is
a
waiver
concept.
well,
it
is
statute
of
limitations
and
waiver
together.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
i
understood
mr.
schreiber
to
say
that
but
the
state
has
not
availed
itself
of
202.
is
that
what
your
honor
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
all
i
can
say
is
i
do
not
know.
you
see
because
i've
been
there
only
18
months.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
and
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i've
never
--
we've
--
we've
taken
advantage
of
state
rights
every
time
we
have
a
changed.
i
will
not
deny
because
it
may
well
be
so.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
which
ones
are
those
if
your
honor
please,
sir?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
oh
--
oh,
you
mean
the
dowels
case
and
the
green
case?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
in
dowels
case
that's
the
one
that
judge
o'hara
held
that
the
jury
was
bad
and
threw
it
out.
that's
some
years
ago.
the
green
case
involved,
and
this
is
quite
important,
the
green
case
involved
a
grand
jury
in
the
country
parishes
of
louisiana.
and
i
make
the
point
because
the
system
of
choosing
juries
in
the
country
parishes
of
louisiana
is
not
the
same
as
in
new
orleans
at
all.
so,
the
green
point,
the
green
case
is
not
threatened
by
this
at
all.
it
had
to
do
with
grand
juries
in
the
country
and
it's
(inaudible)
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
how's
that
sir?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
think
not.
i
believe
it
was
raised
in
time,
i'm
sure
it
was.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
grand
jury
case.
incidentally,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
upheld
the
grand
jury
there.
do
you
want
to
know
why?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
it
was
a
country
grand
jury.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
only
two
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
--
i
do
not
say
they
do
not
exist.
i
don't
know.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
you
see
actually
here's
the
point
that
must
be
remembered.
202
you
know
is
not
an
old
statute
in
louisiana.
202
dates
from
1928
when
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
was
adopted
prior
to
202.
they
are
a
different
system
altogether
so
that
in
fact
these
cases
have
held
since
time
immemorial
if
you
had
such
--
such
a
time.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
because
those
cases,
and
they
are
old
ones,
were
under
the
statutes
existing
prior
to
202.
202
was
actually
a
reversal,
a
deliberate
reversal,
we
claim,
of
the
previous
practice.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
because
personally
i
wouldn't
reverse
my
position
just
on
the
matter
of
personal
integrity.
i
wouldn't
tell
a
man
you
got
until
such
--
such
time
and
then
--
and
then
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
walk
out
on
my
client.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
but
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
why
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
to
clear
showing
that
this
man
and
mr.
schreiber
were
mislead
by
the
judge
who
told
them,
"now,
look
you
have
the
whole
week
to
go
by
natural
equity
to
require.
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
situation.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
this
court
is
--
is
interested
in
--
in
our
arguing
now
as
--
in
support
of
the
wilson
doctrine.
we
had
cross-claimed
that
it's
settled
in
principle,
at
least,
with
the
understanding
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
who
pointed
out
that
every
case
will
stand
on
its
own
facts.
i
will
say
this
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
don't
--
that
i
don't
know
of
any
case.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
that
those
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
the
point
made
by
the
opposition
is
that
it's
--
it's
such
an
outrageous
construction,
which
i
don't
admit,
that
it
must
be
tainted,
that
it
must
have
been
created
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
federal
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
what's
that
sir?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
your
honor
says
that
it's
not
bad
if
it's
not
tainted
with
this
idea
of
evasion.
we
have
in
our
brief
adequate
logical
support
for
the
wilson
doctrine.
it's
pointed
out
in
the
wilson
case
by
itself.
but
why
--
but
why
--
why
does
the
state
have
these
three
days?
in
the
first
place,
because
if
they
interpret
it
to
mean
three
days
after
the
commencement
of
the
grand
jury
term
then
there
would
not
be
adequate
time
to
raise
federal
rights.
had
to
make
it
at
the
end
which
show
the
meticulous
concern
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
for
federal
rights.
now,
let's
look
at
it
from
another
point
of
view.
and
--
and
wilson
says
so,
too.
louisiana
has
a
valid
interest
in
seeing
that
these
attacks
upon
grand
juries
are
made
early,
why?
because
after
all
if
we
have
to
justify
a
grand
jury
presumably
we
have
to
call
the
grand
jurors.
and
in
months
or
years
they're
gone.
they're
scattered.
that
language
is
used
in
wilson.
then,
of
course,
another
part
is
that
louisiana
is
interested
in
correcting
its
errors
as
soon
as
it
may
do
so.
i
don't
believe
that
--
why,
i
know
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
statute
of
limitation
which
is
reasonable
a
--
a
waiver
system
which
is
reasonable.
and
which,
however,
happens
to
cut
off
federal
rights
is
thereby
unconstitutional.
we
state
in
our
brief
quite
a
number
of
cases
on
page
--
page
--
well,
starting
at
page
15,
parker
versus
illinois.
a
very
strong
language
which
we
quoted.
i
won't
read.
it's
there.
haley
versus
commonwealth
where
this
court
--
the
virginia
case
where
this
court
only
recently
denied
writ.
the
man
made
an
attack
upon
the
grand
jury
after
the
trial.
too
late.
and
i
suppose
he
went
to
his
death.
my
point
is
that
these
--
you've
got
to
have
a
rigid
procedure.
you
cannot
upgrade.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
this.
i
think
202
still
stands.
but
i
say
another
constitutional
privilege
enters
into
the
picture.
lack
of
counsel
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
at
an
important
phase
of
his
life.
so,
i
would
say
that
if
a
man
does
not
have
an
attorney
until
after
the
three
days
have
passed,
let's
assume,
202
will
still
stand
but
another
principle
will
come
to
his
aid.
and
i
think
that
then
it
would
be
a
--a
reasonable
time
after
his
appointment.
and
i
think
that
louisiana
could
well
say
it,
three
days
is
reasonable.
i
want
to
comment
before
i
close,
and
i
see
my
time
is
growing
short,
about
one
case
and
it's
the
only
one
the
state
has
been
able
to
find
really
quite
close,
i
think,
to
this
case.
and
that's
avery
versus
alabama
on
--
on
page
--
the
end
of
our
brief.
it's
on
page
18
of
our
brief.
there,
the
defendant
had
counsel
appointed
for
him
on
a
monday.
he
was
brought
to
trial
on
a
thursday
in
a
capital
case.
and
this
court,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
black,
who
wrote
the
opinion,
examined
it
carefully.
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
but
found
the
three
days
was
not
an
unreasonable
time
to
--
to
raise
all
he
had
to
do.
and
to
prepare
for
trial
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
a
motion
for
a
continuance
was
made
on
a
thursday
based
upon
inadequate
time
to
prepare.
and
this
court
upheld
that
conviction.
now,
our
position
is
that
if
three
days
is
enough,
is
a
reasonable
time
to
prepare
for
trial,
then
it
certainly
must
be
a
reasonable
trial
time
to
file
a
motion
which
i
want
to
parenthetically
state
is
in
fact
a
simple
motion.
if
this
court
will
look
at
the
motion
in
the
record,
it's
a
--
it's
a
one
page
motion.
it's
a
one
page
motion
well-known
to
mr.
schreiber,
well-known
to
mr.
fust.
mr
schreiber
probably
defended
against
it,
his
assistant
district
attorney
before,.
nothing
novel.
nothing
requiring
great
study.
nothing
requiring
even
great
typographical
effort.
a
simple
statement
practically
formed
could
be
done
in
a
half
an
hour.
the
state
therefore
submits,
if
this
court
pleases,
that
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
certainly,
this
court
may
examine
the
circumstances
here
but
i
submit
that
it
will
find,
that
unless
he's
willing
to
say
that
judge
hertz
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
do
not
read
the
evidence
from
it
or
that
the
--
that
there
was
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
all
(inaudible)
i
want
to
point
out
another
point
just
in
closing
that
you
see
wilson
and
this
case
too,
these
--
these
principles
are
not
applicable
solely
in
this
negro
exclusion
area.
the
wilson
doctrine
applies
to
white
people.
chianelli
was
a
white
man.
it
applies
to
other
pleas
or
or
attacking
the
grand
jury
then
on
the
basis
of
--
of
a
systematic
exclusion.
now,
that
was
the
case
in
chianelli,
too.
or
the
chianelli
case,
the
attack
was
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
argument,
that
there
were
not
1000
names
in
the
box
when
the
--
when
the
drawing
began.
my
point
is
that
the
effort
made
in
--
in
the
--
by
the
defense
and
that's
all
the
reason
i
mentioned
it.
the
effort
made
by
the
defense
is
to
say
wilson
is
--
is
a
terrible
case.
wilson
is
a
case
designed
by
louisiana
to
--
to
keep
negroes
from
raising
constitutional
points,
is
not
so.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
could
attacked
the
petit
jury
under
the
--
under
the
reasoning
of
the
chianelli
case
until
the
trial
but
mr.
fust
quite
correctly
stated
they
didn't
attack
the
petit
jury
here.
i
don't
know
whether
there
were
negroes
on
this
jury
or
not.
i
know
that
ever
since
i
have
been
there,
the
petit
jury
has
always
had
four
or
five
negroes
or
more
in
the
panel.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
we
have
something
between
6000
and
7000
cases
per
year,
felonies.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
have
six
divisions
of
court.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
more
than
a
small
percentage
and
then
they
haven't
plead
guilty.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
possibly
a
bit
more
than
that.
i
would
say
closer
to
20%.
it
depends
on
the
section,
too.
there
are
some
sections
where
all
cases
go
to
trial.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
no
doubt
about
it.
some
judges
just
simply
won't
talk
to
counsel
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
in
advance
about
what
the
sentence
is
going
to
be,
so
they
go
to
trial.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
i
really
don't
know.
i
--
i
really
don't.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
yes.
if
i
--
i
had
a
--
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
frankly,
we're
making
surveys
all
the
time,
what
are
load
is
but
it's
about
that.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
mr.
duplantier
is
not
going
to
argue
in
this
case,
if
your
honor
pleases.
he
is
going
to
argue
in
the
next
one.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
well,
the
only
point
i
have
--
i
have
to
make
is
your
honor
asked
the
question
and
i
don't
know
that
you
have
a
--
a
full
answer
to
whether
or
not
--
i
think
your
honor's
question
was
--
was
this
--
it
was
that
same
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
in
mind
was
this
an
odd
case,
this
particular
case.
if
this
was
pooled
to
use
against
these
people
whereas
it
was
not
used
against
others.
i
don't
think
that's
so.
now,
of
course,
it
--
it
turns
out
to
be
an
issue
of
fact
between
mr.
becker
and
myself.
he
admits
that
they'll
--
three
or
four
he
says,
maybe
it's
five
or
six.
if
there'd
been
five
or
six
in
the
past
15
years,
that's
normal.
it's
about
what
it
would
be.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
how's
that,
sir?
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
no,
sir.
and
i
want
to
make
the
point
that's
been
made
i
think
by
--
i
think
it's
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
these
points
were
not
raised
until
in
this
court.
mr.
schreiber
admits
that.
i
don't
mean
for
that
that
this
court
has
to
stop
from
considering
those
points.
but
i
do
want
to
say
we
didn't
know
they
were
coming
up.
we
had
no
opportunity
to
answer
them.
we
had
no
idea.
the
whole
brief
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
does
not
signal
out
these
issues.
does
not
signal
out
that
this
was
a
direct
discrimination
against
these
people.
mr.
leon
d.
hubert,
jr.
there's
nothing
to
show
that
there
was
such
here.
