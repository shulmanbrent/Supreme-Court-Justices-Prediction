mr.
john
p.
frank
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arizona.
the
parties
are,
first,
the
petitioners,
joan
collins,
a
widow,
and
her
infant
son,
the
defendant,
corporation,
american
buslines,
and
the
defendant,
industrial
commission
of
arizona.
mrs.
collins
is
the
widow
of
one
adolphus
collins,
whose
death
gives
rise
to
this
action,
and
adolphus
collins
was
employed
as
a
bus
driver
by
the
corporate
defendant.
under
the
law
of
arizona,
the
claim
for
industrial
compensation,
which
is
made
here,
will
result
and
recompense
being
made,
if
any
should
be
allowed
by
this
court,
will
result
in
recompense
being
made
to
mrs.
collins
from
a
fund
which
is
maintained
by
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona.
and
hence,
so
far
as
mrs.
collins
is
concerned,
her
only
interest
is
with
the
industrial
commission.
and
hence,
that
is
the
only
active
or
participating
defendant
here.
the
american
buslines
company
is
a
nebraska
corporation;
it
is
in
receivership
in
nebraska.
it
has
been
duly
informed
and
notified
at
all
times
with
the
process
of
this
matter
from
the
beginning
to
this
moment,
it
has
not
participated.
should
you
decide
the
matter
in
favor
of
the
petitioners,
there
will
be
a
possible
result
in
claim
of
the
industrial
commission
against
the
buslines,
but
that
will
be
a
separate
action
and
will
have
to
worry
itself
along,
independent
of
--
of
what
we
do
here.
hence,
this
is
a
controversy
for
all
practical
and
real
purposes
between
the
petitioner
and
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona.
now,
the
facts
of
the
matter
are
these,
the
husband
of
the
petitioning
widow
was
originally
employed
as
a
bus
driver
by
the
defendant
corporation
at
el
paso,
texas,
and
i
believe,
1951.
the
company
moved
him
from
el
paso
to
arizona.
and
there,
for
some
time,
he
operated
the
run
from
tucson,
arizona,
to
phoenix,
arizona.
in
the
course
of
that
operation,
he
became
acquainted
with
and
married
the
widow
here,
a
girl
from
phoenix,
and
they
lived
there
for
a
time.
then,
subsequently,
the
deceased
was
transferred
by
his
company
from
the
tucson,
phoenix
run
to
the
phoenix,
los
angeles
run,
an
operation
entirely
in
interstate
commerce.
and
at
that
time,
he
took
his
little
family,
then
an
--
an
infant
of
a
few-weeks-old
and
wife,
over
to
los
angeles
where
they
rented
a
trailer.
and
while
he
kept
a
mail
address
in
phoenix,
he
was
in
fact
living
in
--
insofar
as
he
had
any
formal
legal
residence,
it
was
--
we
will
concede
los
angeles,
in
--
in
the
trailer
there.
his
job
consisted
of
driving
from
los
angeles
to
phoenix
or
return
from
phoenix
to
los
angeles.
the
mileage
was
approximately
60%
in
california,
about
40%
in
our
own
state
of
arizona.
the
company,
as
i
say,
has
been
in
financial
difficulties.
whether
that
does
or
does
not
account
for
the
incident,
i
have
no
idea
at
all.
we've
merely
speculated,
but
it
was
in
any
case
using
retread
tires
and
one
of
them
blew
out
at
wickenburg,
arizona,
killing
adolphus
henry
collins
in
the
resulting
crash.
his
widow
instituted
proceedings
for
industrial
compensation
in
the
state
of
arizona
before
the
industrial
commission
there.
let
me
explain
that
insofar
as
she
had
choice
as
between
california
and
arizona,
she
chose
arizona
for
the
obvious
reason,
which
is
that
arizona
has
extremely
high
compensation
in
death
cases,
california,
very
low.
the
california
compensation
would
run
something
like
$6000,
perhaps,
the
arizona
compensation
closer
to
$75,000.
so
then,
hence,
she
sought
to
--
to
do
what
anyone
would
do
under
the
circumstances,
to
pursue
the
arizona
remedy,
if
she
had
one.
this
is
the
details,
although,
i
think
they're
not
relevant
to
--
to
any
matter,
which
you
need
to
decide.
now,
this
matter
then
came
before
the
industrial
commission
of
arizona.
and
now,
may
i
mention
the
first
of
the
two
or
three
cases
that
you
all
ought
to
have
in
mind
in
the
course
of
this
discussion.
that
is
the
case
of
watson
brothers
as
it
had
previously
been
decided
in
the
state
of
arizona.
prior
to
--
a
couple
of
years
prior
to
this
incident,
the
law
of
arizona
had
been
accepted
as
applying
to
employees
who
are
either
employed
in
the
state
or
partially
outside
of
the
state.
that
question
was
reviewed
in
the
case
of
watson
brothers.
now,
the
watson
brothers
case,
please
hold
in
mind,
was
a
case
that
was
decided
before
this
matter.
it
is
a
case
which
was
materially
affected
by
what
was
done
here.
in
the
watson
brothers
case,
our
court
took
another
look
at
the
--
at
its
own
workmen's
compensation
law.
and
it
concluded
that
the
term
"regularly
employed,"
which
is
the
measure
of
coverage,
could
not
apply
to
persons
who
were
engaged
at
all
in
employment
outside
the
state
of
arizona,
in
large
part
because
they
fear
it
would
be
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
commerce.
therefore,
when
this
case
came
along,
the
industrial
commission
did
the
only
thing
it
could
do,
it
held
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
at
all
under
the
then
prevailing
watson
brothers
case.
at
that
point,
following
the
normal
arizona
practice,
my
partners
appealed
to
this
matter
to
the
arizona
supreme
court,
and
we
asked
the
arizona
supreme
court
to
overrule
the
watson
brothers
case
and
to
restore
the
laws
that
had
previously
been.
that
is
to
say
so
that
the
act
could
be
in
general
application
for
persons
whether
within
or
without
the
state
in
appropriate
circumstances.
and
this,
the
arizona
supreme
court
was
persuaded
to
do.
it
said,
“we
repudiate
the
watson
brothers
decision.
we
decide
that
our
law
which
is
meant
to
be
generous
have
been
construed
in
a
niggardly
fashion
there,
and
we
hold
that
our
law
does
cover
all
persons
who
are
employed
in
the
state
or
outside
the
state,
at
least
where
the
injury
occurs
within
the
state."
but
then,
they
went
to
having
repudiated,
that
was
their
word.
they
--
they
had
rejected
the
watson
brothers
case
entirely.
the
court
then
went
on
to
the
exact
immediate
situation
and
it
held
that
our
law
could
not
constitutionally
apply
in
the
case
of
a
motor
carrier
operator
who
was
engaged
exclusively
in
the
interstate
commerce.
in
short,
they
held
that
the
law
cover
the
situation,
but
in
fact
that
it
could
not
that
it
was
invalid
in
this
one
context.
they
said,
and
i
should
explain
that
you
have
permitted
us
to
come
up
here
on
a
petition
in
which
we
have
printed
the
relevant
matters
in
the
back
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
that
is
where
the
opinion
is
and
you've
not
had
us
redo
it,
they
said
and
i
quote
from
passages
at
page
20
and
21
of
that
petition.
i'm
quoting
from
the
opinion
of
the
majority,
"we
hold
that
to
assume
jurisdiction
under
our
workmen's
compensation
laws
on
the
facts
of
this
case
would
constitute
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce."
they
said,
"if
the
decedent
had
not
been
covered
in
california,
then
there
would
be
no
duplication
upon
which
to
find
an
undue
burden.
it
is
not
the
application
of
state
workmen's
compensation
laws
which
is
prohibited
under
our
interpretation
of
the
commerce
clause
but
a
double
application."
now,
let
me
make
clear
exactly
what
it
was
that
was
troubling
our
court.
the
court
did
not
have
the
impression
that
there
was
any
possibility
of
double
coverage
in
the
sense
of
being
paid
twice.
the
court
cites
and
analyzes
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
matter
of
mccartney,
and
it
recognized
that
the
smaller
award
would
be
credited
against
the
larger.
there's
no
--
no
fear
on
our
court's
part
in
that
respect.
the
burden
to
which
our
court
found
was
the
fact
that
the
bus
company
would
have
to
carry
added
insurance.
the
burden
is
the
extra
insurance
which
is
required
if
it
is
--
are
required
to
insure
to
cover
the
arizona
load
as
well
as
the
california
load.
the
court
says
at
page
20
into
what
is
the
heart
of
the
decision,
"if
we
were
to
reach
the
result
which
petitioner
wants,
the
only
recourse
of
the
bus
company
would
be
to
establish
protection
from
liability
in
all
states
by
the
payment
of
insurance
premiums."
the
threat
of
liability
would
require
duplicate
premiums,
and
it
is
this
duplication
which
creates
the
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
it
is
the
need
imposed
by
the
laws
of
our
state
to
insure
twice
that
constitutes
the
undue
burden,
not
the
manner
in
which
the
duplications
it
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
considerably,
yes.
mr.
john
p.
frank
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
the
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
this
is
where
the
added
cost
would
come
from,
your
honor.
the
carrier
could
--
has
its
choice
under
our
law
of
insuring
either
in
the
state
fund
or
of
insuring
outside
in
separate.
the
net
effect
of
the
decision,
if
it
went
away,
we
think
it
should
go.
they
require
him
to
use
the
outside
insurance,
rather
than
the
state
fund
in
order
that
he
could
do
exactly
what
you
say,
namely,
that
he
could
take
an
insurance
broad
enough
to
cover
the
largest
liability
of
the
jury
--
of
all
jurisdictions
in
which
he
operates.
mr.
john
p.
frank
i
do
not
believe.
i
will
ask
mr.
franks,
my
almost
namesake
to
--
who
was
the
counsel
to
the
industrial
commission,
may
qualify
this,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
he
could
insure
in
the
fund
which
mr.
franks
represents
in
such
fashion
as
would
also
cover
him
for
a
california
liability.
it
is
my
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
your
honor,
other
than
a
possible
slight
increase
in
cost,
i
know
of
none.
none
has
been
suggested.
there
is
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
that's
right.
we're
dealing
with
a
cost
and
i'll
take
it
up
in
a
moment.
there
is
--
it
is
likely
to
be
slight,
very
slightly
more
expensive
if
he
is
required
to
carry
higher
insurance
to
cover
all
of
the
states
in
which
the
employer
operates.
mr.
john
p.
frank
if
he
--
he
would
be
completely
protected,
if
he
insures
with
any
private
insurance
company
which
permits
him
to
get
general
coverage.
mr.
john
p.
frank
my
impression,
your
honor,
is
that
the
california
fund
also
would
not
permit
him
to
pay
an
arizona
judgment
so
that
the
net
effect
would
be
that
i
--
i
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
in
accordance
with
the
california
law,
yes,
but
he
would
not
be
protected
as
i
understand
it
against
ours.
mr.
john
p.
frank
he'd
either
have
take
workmen's
compensation
wherever
he
goes
or
else
do
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggest
and
what
the
interstate
carriers
would
necessarily
do,
namely,
go
outside
the
state
funds
and
take
his
insurance
with
somebody
big
enough
to
cover
all
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
p.
frank
of
course
not.
now,
they
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
now
--
now,
your
honor
is
on
that
point,
but
i
--
i
must
--
that
i'm
unable
to
answer
you
as
satisfactorily
as
i
wish
i
could,
i
am
not
sure.
but
my
impression
is,
and
i'm
--
i'm
willing
to
yield
the
point
against
myself
since
i
don't
know
for
sure.
my
impression
is
that
the
california
coverage
would
protect
him
only
for
a
judgment
given
in
california,
and
that
the
california
fund
would
not
protect
him.
mr.
john
p.
frank
am
i
correct
in
that?
mr.
john
p.
frank
he
would
be
protected,
but
only
in
the
amount
which
california
allows.
mr.
john
p.
frank
right.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
that
is
exactly
correct.
now,
the
basic
problem,
which
is
here,
is
the
question
of
the
extent
to
which
in
an
interstate
commerce
situation,
the
law
of
the
place
of
injury
is
allowed
to
be
controlling
for
purposes
of
workmen's
compensation.
this
court
has
had
an
extraordinary
number
of
cases
on
this
general
problem
over
the
years;
the
problem
of
the
place
of
contract
or
the
place
of
residence
versus
the
place
of
injury.
and
it
may
be
useful
if
we
briefly
review
your
recent
holdings
in
this
area
and
feels
which
almost,
but
not
quite,
close
the
matter
which
is
before
you
today.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
the
general
problem.
mr.
john
p.
frank
the
proposition
of
law,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
which
we
tended
to
this
court
is,
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
by
virtue
of
its
commerce
clause,
puts
no
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
state
of
arizona
to
give
a
workmen's
compensation
award
to
a
driver
in
interstate
commerce
who
is
in
fact
injured
in
that
state.
we
must
necessarily
assert
a
negative,
namely,
that
there
is
no
constitutional
limitation
as
our
court
below
thought
there
was
to
do
what
in
all
humanity
had
clearly
wanted
to
do
when
what
it
felt
to
constrain
from
doing
solely
because
of
its
conception
of
the
laws
laid
down
by
this
tribunal.
mr.
john
p.
frank
we
can
word
it
in
terms
of
the
insurance
cost
and
if
that
puts
it
more
narrowly,
fairly
enough.
then
the
question
is,
can
a
state
of
injury
give
a
judgment
in
workmen's
compensation
despite
the
fact
that
permitting
such
a
rule
may
slightly
increase
the
cost
of
insurance?
mr.
john
p.
frank
if
arizona
chose
to
do
that,
but
i
must
concede
that
arizona
has
it,
so
that
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
it's
an
extremely
narrow
problem,
indeed
it
is.
and
the
bulk
of
what
is
here,
this
court
disposed
of
last
year
in
an
opinion
in
the
case
of
carroll,
which
i
think
hadn't
been
decided
when
this
matter
was
argued
in
arizona,
might
possibly
have
led
to
an
opposite
result
there.
the
situation
there
was
this.
in
the
carroll
case,
you
have
the
problem
of
an
employee
who
was
hired
in
the
state
of
missouri
and
who
lived
in
the
state
of
missouri,
but
who
went
to
arkansas
to
do
his
work.
and
in
arkansas,
he
was
injured.
the
case
up
to
this
point
is
identical
with
the
instant
case
but
for
one
circumstance,
and
that
is
that
the
employee
was
not
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce.
he
was
a
construction
worker.
he
made
a
claim
in
missouri,
actually
receives
some
workmen's
compensation,
our
person
has
not
done
that,
abandoned
it,
went
back
to
arkansas
and
made
his
claim
there.
and
the
question
was
whether,
under
those
circumstances,
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
require
that
he
be
given
his
compensation
only
in
the
state
of
missouri,
then
to
the
state
of
his
residence,
the
state
of
this
contracting.
this
court
reviewed
the
subject
over
a
period
of
the
many
years
that
that
question
has
been
before
you,
and
you
said,
referring
back
to
pacific
employers
liability
case,
"that
case
teaches
that
in
this
personal
injury
cases,
the
state
where
the
injury
occurs
need
not
be
a
vessel
to
the
home
state
and
allow
only
that
remedy
which
the
home
state
has
marked
as
the
exclusive
one.
the
state
of
the
form
also
has
interest
to
serve
and
to
protect.
her
interests
are
large
and
considerable
and
are
to
be
weighed,
not
only
in
the
light
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
by
the
kind
of
situation
presented
for
we
write
not
only
for
this
case
and
this
day
alone,
but
for
this
type
of
case.
the
state
where
the
tort
occurs,
certainly,
has
a
concern
in
the
problems
following
in
the
wake
of
the
injury."
and
thereupon,
this
court
went
on
to
specify
what
some
of
them
were.
in
other
words,
for
full
faith
and
credit
purposes,
you
have
now
held
that
in
the
general
run
of
situations,
that
would
be
most
of
the
cases,
the
state
of
injury
does
have
a
right
to
give
workmen's
compensation
despite
the
fact
that
the
employee
lives
elsewhere
and
made
--
then
he's
made
his
contract
of
employment
elsewhere.
now,
we
can
narrow
the
problem
down
still
further.
the
question
arises
as
to
employees
who
are
partially
in
interstate
commerce
or
working
for
companies
which
are
partially
in
interstate
commerce
but
not
exclusively
so.
most
of
the
trouble
in
this
field
arises
from
the
ohio
case
of
spohn.
in
the
ohio
case
of
spohn,
duly
cited,
it
was
held
that
where
pure
interstate
commerce
was
involved,
the
state
of
the
injury
could
not
give
recovery
in
situations
such
as
the
one
we
have
here.
in
that
case,
the
court
did
not
cite
or
mention
and
it
was
apparently
not
aware
of
the
pacific
employers
insurance
company
case
of
this
court
which
had
been
recently
decided.
and
it
cited
no
federal
cases
whatsoever
on
the
critical
point.
two
years
thereafter,
ohio
modified
its
spohn
case,
and
in
the
case
of
holly,
held
that
this
rule
would
not
apply
where
the
company
was
engaged
in
any
intrastate
commerce
at
all,
even
though
the
particular
driver
was
engaged
exclusively
in
an
interstate
commerce.
and
this
distinction
was
accepted
by
the
arizona
court.
there
is
no
decision
by
this
court,
square
on
the
point,
but
what
i
am
meaning
to
call
to
your
attention
is
that
so
far
as
your
decisions
are
concerned
in
the
general
run
of
situations,
you
have
found
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
does
not
bar
compensation
in
the
state
of
injury.
and
that
the
state
cases,
i
have
cited
others,
i'm
merely
giving
you
high
spots
orally,
that
the
state
cases
have
held,
including
even
the
court
below,
that
the
commerce
clause
itself
does
not
bar
a
recovery,
except
in
a
case
of
a
company,
which
is
supposed
to
be
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce,
and
only,
that
one
ohio
case
and
this
case,
have
held
that.
the
new
york
cases
have
gone
quite
the
other
way
and
so
of
others,
which
we
have
decided
to
which
they
have
been
duly
cited.so,
we
then
come
down
to
the
narrow
point,
which
is
before
you
now,
the
only
matter
which
is
in
contest.
under
the
repeated
decisions,
the
state
of
injury
can
give
workmen's
compensation
in
a
wide
variety
of
situations.
there
is
a
decision
covering
almost
every
imaginable
situation,
except
the
one
of
the
company
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce.
and
the
problem
is,
should
there
be
an
exception
made
in
that
area
to
exclude
those
cases
and
those
persons
from
workmen's
compensation
in
the
state
of
injury?
now,
the
court
below
reached
its
result
on
the
basis
of
the
citation
of
only
one
case
from
this
court,
and
that
was
southern
pacific
against
arizona.
your
honors
are
keenly
aware
that
in
a
state
such
as
my
own,
we
don't
get
so
many
constitutional
cases
or
so
many
commerce
clause
cases
and
these
are
not
customarily
familiar
matters.
and
hence,
there
is
likely
to
be
a
once-bitten,
twice-shy
psychology.
and
the
fact
that
our
court
was
reversed
in
southern
pacific
against
arizona
undoubtedly
caused
it
to
be
peculiarly
sensitive
to
the
teachings
of
that
case.
you
will
recall
that
in
the
southern
pacific
case,
this
court
invalidated
a
statute
from
my
state,
which
put
a
limitation
on
the
number
of
cars
that
there
could
be
in
trains
running
across
the
state.
this
court
found
upon
an
extensive
factual
record
or
in
majority
that
this
court
found
upon
an
extensive
factual
record
that
the
arizona
law,
first,
served
no
useful
purpose,
that
it
did
not
promote
safety
indeed
that
it
impeded
it.
and
second,
that
it
severely
crippled
traffic
operating
between
el
paso
and
los
angeles.
against
that
framework,
this
court
held
that
that
particular
regulation
was
invalid.
we
submit
that
that
case
really
has
no
bearing
on
the
instant
case,
that
it
is
not
authority
for
holding
invalid,
the
state
law,
which
we
now
have.
where
there
is
no
possible
discrimination
against
commerce,
there
is
no
burden
on
commerce
except
to
denote
minor
financial
burden
with
that.
and
where
the
--
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
the
factors
which
influence
some
of
you
in
the
southern
pacific
case,
because
there,
you
believe,
many
of
you,
that
transportation
in
the
southwest
would
be
severely
impeded
or
was
being
severely
impeded
by
the
arizona
law,
and
no
one
can
suppose
that
such
a
result
is
likely
to
follow
here.
indeed,
the
cases,
the
state
cases
that
have
considered
the
point,
they
are
duly
cited.
they've
gone
the
other
way,
and
indeed,
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
in
recent
years
at
least,
involving
a
police
power
regulation
such
as
this,
in
which
you
have
invalidated
a
state
statute,
purely
because
of
a
financial
burden
where
there
was
no
discrimination
against
the
interstate
commerce,
no
serious
handicap
to
interstate
commerce
and
indeed,
almost
no
burden
at
all.
mr.
john
p.
frank
mr.
justice,
but
in
your
--
in
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
freeman
against
hewitt,
for
example,
the
--
you
yourself
were
careful
to
emphasize
the
possible
greater
leniency,
which
may
be
allowed
to
police
power
regulations.
and
in
the
general
run
of
the
commerce
clause
cases
here
that
you
have
been
invalidating
have
been
cases
of
actual
serious
or
substantial
burden
or
discrimination.
as
for
example,
in
dean
milk,
a
majority
of
this
court
supposed
that
the
trade
between
illinois
and
dane
county,
wisconsin
would
be
rendered
virtually
impossible
by
the
local
arguments.or
in
the
hood
mill
case,
you
supposed
that
the
same
result
was
reached
as
for
the
trade
between
troy,
new
york,
and
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
massachusetts,
or
in
southern
pacific,
these
are
the
recent
major
invalidations
here.
in
southern
pacific,
you
supposed
the
--
the
arizona
case
that
there
was
a
very
heavy
and
serious
burden.
now,
here,
we
are
dealing
at
most
with
the
financial
burden
of
most
minor
proportion.
it
is
impossible
on
this
record
to
demonstrate
what
that
burden
would
be.
there
is
no
record.
there
is
no
showing
at
all
of
burden.
and
i
remind
you
that
this
court
in
southern
pacific
held
that
it
would
not
invalidate
laws
on
this
ground
unless
there
was
some
actual
factual
showing,
either
in
the
record
or
which
could
reasonably
be
supposed.
but
here,
i
don't
know,
but
what
it
is
worth,
and
i
do
not
claim
that
it
is
more
than
suggesting.
we
have
appended
such
statistics
as
there
are
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
which
may
be
at
least
suggestive
on
the
particular
subject.
if
i
may
direct
your
attention
in
the
brief
of
petitioners
to
the
summary
of
those
statistics
at
page
5,
and
you
may
assume
that
this
comes
from
the
most
recent
report
of
the
i.c.c.
and
it's
the
best
statics
we
have.
you
will
see
that
the
percentage
of
workmen's
compensation
cost
to
the
total
cost
of
bus
operations
is
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
6600
of
1%.
but
that
percentage
covers
all
workmen's
compensation
for
all
types
of
employees;
intrastate,
interstate,
the
station
attendants,
all
the
rest
of
them.
i
will
not
burden
you
here,
but
i
have
outlined
in
the
brief
and
do
suggest
that
the
amount
of
actual
increase
of
burden
on
the
industry
which
would
be
required,
which
would
be
imposed
if
the
motor
carriers
are
required
to
insure
to
the
highest
jurisdiction
through
which
they
operate,
is
in
the
realm
of
at
most
a
few
thousands
of
one
percent.
we
are
dealing
without
doubt.
i
respectfully
submit,
with
the
most
minute,
trifling
burden,
which
has
ever
been
found
or
at
least
has
been
found
in
recent
years
to
be
supposed
to
be
a
serious
burden
on
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
p.
frank
no,
i
assume
that,
and
indeed,
i
--
i
am
acquainted
with
the
general
practice.
and
normally,
there
is
full
insurance
adequate
to
carry
all
kinds
of
--
of
obligations.
and
why
there
should
not
be,
for
example,
if
the
truck
hit
somebody
in
the
state
of
arizona,
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
they'd
have
to
pay
compensation
and
they'd
have
to
carry
insurance
to
pay
for
it.
and
why
the
one
small
category
of
employee
should
be
excluded
from
that
protection
is
to
me
unfathomable.
i'm
merely
saying
that
the
workmen's
compensation
cost
is
--
is
a
very,
very
small
amount
and
that
it
would
be
harsh
in
the
extreme
to
interpret
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
bar
recovery
in
state
of
injury
for
the
employee
who
is
actually
operating
the
motor
carrier.
mr.
john
p.
frank
this
company
had
sufficient
compensation
in
arizona
so
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
claiming
against
this
fund.
the
exact
details
of
that
are
better
known
to
mr.
franks
than
they
are
to
me.
if
i
may
have
it
back
for
a
moment
more
to
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
p.
frank
what
we'll
do
in
arizona
is
this.
mr.
john
p.
frank
there
is
a
system
of
paying
into
the
fund,
which
mr.
franks
represents,
and
this
is
done
on
a
system
of
assessments
and
--
and
notices
and
so
on.
now,
i
confess
that
i
cannot
tell
you
in
detail
how
it
works.
i
simply
don't
know,
but
it
is
adequate
for
this
court.
mr.
john
p.
frank
sufficiently
so
that
there
--
no
claim
has
been
raised
at
any
time,
but
that
mrs.collins
is
properly
proceeding
against
the
industrial
commission
for
possible
dispute
which
the
industrial
commission
may
someday
have
on
american
busline,
may
bring
mr.
franks
back
here,
but
i
will
not
be
with
it.
if
i
may
just
pause
for
just
a
moment
more
of
the
question
of
the
chief
justice,
i
call
to
your
attention,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
this
court,
prior
to
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935,
in
three
separate
cases,
held
that
the
state
did
have
power
to
impose
insurance
requirements
on
the
motor
carriers
operating
within
their
borders.
so
that
what
we
are
down
through
are
--
is
whether
the
employees
operating
the
interstate
carriers
should
be
entitled
to
the
same
kind
of
protection
of
the
state
in
a
state
of
injury,
which
substantially
everybody
else
in
the
economy
of
the
united
states
can
have.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
p.
frank
could
i
have
the
petition
please
on
this?
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i
think
by
now,
every
member
on
the
bench
is
keenly
aware
of
problems
and
there
is
really,
only
moments
more
time
worth
--
worth
taking.
you
can
see
what
happened,
namely,
that
this
matter
came
up
to
the
state
supreme
court
below.
the
petitioner
there
contended
that
the
watson
brothers
case
should
be
overruled.
mr.
franks
contended,
on
the
other
hand,
that
it
should
be
followed,
that
there
were
adequate
reasons
in
state
law
for
deciding
this
against
the
petitioners.
it
is,
i
think,
reasonably
apparent
that
almost
to
his
horror;
the
--
the
supreme
court
went
off
on
a
frolic
of
its
own.
it
repudiated
the
watson
brothers
case
that
decided
it
was
wrong
but
on
--
this
federal
constitution
precluded
it
from
going
the
last
step
of
the
way.
the
--
the
essence
of
the
problem
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
as
a
matter
--
mr.
john
p.
frank
i
would
say,
mr.
--
mr.
justice,
that
--
that
i
should
not
have
--
have
been
lied
some
about
it
because
i
know
that
our
justices
suffered
pretty
mildly
over
this
case.
they
were
distressed
as
of
course
they
would
be.
and
as
you
can
see,
from
the
earnestness
with
which
all
the
points
in
view
are
expressed,
that
was
a
--
a
serious
and
indeed
troublesome
matter
of
court.
now,
essentially,
the
only
argument
that
is
made
here
in
defense
of
the
opinion
below
is
that
--
well,
i
shall
say
not
the
only
one,
there
are
two.
first,
the
no-federal
question
was
decided
because
despite
the
extensive
consideration
by
the
court,
there
are
other
unstated
grounds
which
the
court
had
in
mind,
which
accounted
for
its
conclusion.
let
me
say
merely
that
that
cannot
amount
to
any
independent
state
ground,
and
an
independent
state
ground
of
what
would
be
required.
passage
to
which
mr.
franks
refers
at
the
top
of
page
21,
i
think
if
seen
in
fuller
context,
is
not
really
as
disturbing
as
--
as
he
suggests.
at
page
20
and
21,
the
discussion
is
full.
the
sentence
he
quotes
is,
“we
do
not
decline
jurisdiction
merely
for
the
reason
that
the
decedent
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
but
in
view
of
an
additional
consideration
that
he
was
also
covered
in
another
jurisdiction.
if
decedent
had
not
been
covered
in
california,
then
there
would
have
be
no
duplication
upon
which
to
find
an
undue
burden.
it
is
not
the
application
and
so
on.
it
is
the
double
application."
in
other
words,
the
court
is,
i
think,
can
fairly
be
said
to
be
resting
on
a
conception
of
the
commerce
clause.
the
other
point,
which
is
made
by
mr.
franks,
is
that
the
law,
as
interpreted
below,
a
creed
of
the
constitutional
limitation
will
create
much
difficulty
and
perhaps
it
will
because
it's
a
problem
for
--
for
others
to
worry
with.
beyond
that,
i
--
i
have
no
further
comment
unless
the
bench
has
questions.
thank
you
very
much.
