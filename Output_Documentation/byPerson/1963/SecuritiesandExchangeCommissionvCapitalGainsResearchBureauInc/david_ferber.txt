mr.
david
ferber
mr.
chief
justice,
court
please?
this
case
involves
the
construction
of
subsections
1
and
2
of
section
206
of
the
investment
advisers
act
of
1940
that
those
sections
are
set
forth
in
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief
and
state
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
investment
advisor
by
the
jurisdictional
means,
one
to
employ
any
device
scheme
or
artifice
to
defraud
any
client
or
a
perspective
client
or
two,
to
engage
in
any
transaction
practice
or
course
of
business
which
operates
as
a
fraud
or
deceit
upon
any
client
or
perspective
client.
the
commission
contends
that
this
section
is
violated
when
an
investment
advisor
who
recommends
a
security
to
a
large
number
of
paying
subscribers
follows
a
practice
of
trading
on
the
market
effect
of
his
advice
without
disclosing
to
his
clients
that
he
doing
so.
what
he
did
here,
the
pattern
of
his
activity,
was
to
purchase
particular
securities
then
recommend
these
securities
for
a
long-term
gain
and
then
sell
on
the
market
rise
that
followed
his
recommendation.
the
court
below
in
a
five
to
four
en
banc
opinion
affirmed
the
district
judge
and
holding
that
this
was
not
a
fraud
within
the
meaning
of
the
sections
that
i
have
just
read
to
you.
mr.
david
ferber
yes
your
honor
on
most
preliminary
injunction
in
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
before
going
into
any
detail
on
the
facts
i
would
like
emphasize
a
few
matters
that
we
don't
believe
are
involved
in
this
case,
but
by
reason
of
the
characterizations
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
--
some
of
the
commission's
contentions
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
we
don't
believe
this
case
involves
the
question
whether
an
investment
advisor
may
generally
buy
or
sell
securities
he
recommends.
we
think
that
this
would
not
necessarily
in
all
circumstances
be
fraudulent.
we
don't
think
this
involves
the
question
as
to
whether
if
an
investment
advisor
buy
securities
for
--
that
he
is
recommending
but
sells
them
for
a
short
term
gain
even
though
he
is
recommending
for
a
long-term
gain
that
this
would
necessarily
under
every
circumstance
be
fraudulent.
mr.
david
ferber
there
could
well
be
circumstances
where
the
investment
advisor
intended
to
hold
for
a
--
to
do
exactly
what
he
was
recommending
for
his
clients
and
something
subsequently
arise
whereby
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
sell
the
security.
certainly
if
it
were
a
practice
as
we
have
here
where
it
occurs
time
and
again
we
think
that
we
would
have
to
assume
that
there
was
an
intent
to
sell
at
the
time
he
purchased
assuming
the
market
reached
the
price
that
he
hoped
it
would
on
the
effect
of
his
recommendation,
but
the
mere
--
certainly
this
case
does
not
have
a
fact
which
would
indicate
that
--
the
mere
fact
that
he
should
in
one
instance
sell
after
recommending
a
long-term
buy
that
would
be
fraudulent
i
don't
think
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
think
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
was
that
we
would
have
to
prove
an
intent
other
than
by
the
pattern
that
we
did
show
here,
which
was
over
a
period
of
eight
months
i
believe
it
was.
we
showed
that
with
respect
to
seven
securities
and
six
of
these
monthly
reports
there
are
was
this
pattern
followed,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
certainly
we
did
not
contend
to
the
court
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
occasion
a
man
might
have
recommended
the
security
for
a
long-term
gain
and
if
he
had
bought
at
the
same
time
that
it
would
necessarily
be
a
fraud
should
he
on
one
occasion
by
reason
should
he
be
able
to
show
other
factors
that
required
his
selling
and
that
this
would
necessarily
be
fraudulent.
mr.
david
ferber
not
certainly
under
all
circumstances
and
it
could
necessarily
not
be
a
fraud
even
under
those
circumstance,
but
we
--
mr.
david
ferber
no,
we
would
not
so
contend,
not
in
the
absence
of
some
general
rule
or
policy
and
certainly
that
is
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
david
ferber
yes
your
honor
our
position
is
that
where
a
practice
is
followed
this
so
called
scalping,
purchasing
a
security
with
the
necessary
intent
as
is
shown
by
the
repeated
performance,
purchasing
it
before
the
recommendation,
selling
it
on
the
rise
following
the
recommendation
and
not
disclosing
this
that,
that
is
a
clear
fraud
by
reason.
mr.
david
ferber
no,
i
don't
that
goes
beyond
the
finding
of
the
trial
court,
i
think
that
the
trial
court
merely
stated
that
the
there
was
no
proof
that
the
advice
was
not
honest
in
a
sense
that
he
did
not
think
that
it
made
a
good
long-term
gain.
i
would
make
one
another
statement
as
to
what
we
do
not
contend
before
going
into
the
facts
in
somewhat
more
detail
--
mr.
david
ferber
that
is
certainly
--
is
certainly
not
this
case
and
i
doubt
that
would
be
--we
would
consider
that
fraudulent
your
honor
if
he
was
purchasing.
the
only
possibility
of
fraud
in
that
circumstance
is
--
the
circumstance
would
be
that
perhaps
he
is
purchasing
a
little
lower
than
the
people
to
whom
he
is
recommending
which
does
tend
to
create
a
sort
of
conflict
it's
that
is
much
more
of
a
borderline
case.
i
just
wanted
to
emphasize
also
that
we
do
not
contend
that
the
kind
of
a
statement
that
we
may
or
may
not
have
a
position
in
these
securities
(inaudible)
several
places
in
the,
my
opponent's
brief
it
is
urged
that
we
do
so
contend.
we
contend
that
only
a
full
description
of
the
practice
that
he
was
following
would
prevent
it
from
being
fraudulent.
now
--
mr.
david
ferber
there
were
affidavits
yes
mr.
justice
goldberg,
but
the
essential
facts
were
not
in
dispute.
it
was
not
in
dispute
that
on
the
six
different
occasions
in
this
eight-month
period
and
with
respect
to
seven
different
securities
because
one
of
the
pamphlets
both
recommended
one
and
disparaged
another
and
the
trading
was
in
both
through
a
short
sale
on
the
disparaged
security,
this
certainly
would
be
sufficient
particularly
on
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
is
perhaps
in
many
respects
the
strongest
weapon
in
the
commission's
enforcement
arsenal.
if
we
had
to
wait
for
a
trial
on
the
merits,
the
practice
could
have
continued
and
if
the
advisees
were
being
defrauded
as
we
contend
this
would
have
continued
necessarily
for
many
months
longer
presumably.
so
that
--
mr.
david
ferber
it
is
urged
that
there
was
a
voluntary
offer
to
discontinue.
the
record
merely
shows
that
they
stated
that
if
there
were
a
commission
rule
they
would
not
continue
it,
i
believe.
there
may
have
been
some
other
very
general
language,
but
the
--
there
was
certainly
no
full
assurance
of
the
sort
that
a
government
agency
would
have
to
have
i
think
not
to
continue
with
–
at
this
time
and
it
was
very
important
to
us.
i
mean
if
we
can't
show
this
kind
of
thing
on
a
preliminary
injunction,
we
can't
show
much
on
a
permanent
except
perhaps
more
of
the
same,
more
transactions
of
this
sort.
we
are
not
going
to
find
some
letter
perhaps
written
by
him
stating
that
my
state
of
mind
is
to
sell
in
such
a,
such
a
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
don't
say
mr.
justice
harlan
that
we
might
not
be
able
to
add
additional
instances
of
this.
but
--
mr.
david
ferber
i'd
say
this
makes
out
our
case,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
ferber
at
this
point
if
the
district
judge
had
said
that
in
my
discretion
it
seems
to
me
you
haven't
showed
a
course
of
business
or
a
course
of
conduct
because
this
is
an
occasional
thing
and
you
have
a
burden
here
of
showing
something
more
of
a
pattern
i
suppose
in
that
area
if
we
were
put
in
terms
of
discretion
that
perhaps
we
would
have
gone
ahead
for
the
permanent
injunction
and
that
attempted
to
appeal
as
in
abuse
of
discretion,
but
this
case
does
not
involve
discretion.
the
district
judge
made
it
clear
that
he
just
did
not
believe
that
this
practice
was
fraudulent.
mr.
david
ferber
it
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
would
think
so
if
it
were
proved
--
if
we
could
prove
that
the
intent
to
sale
but
short
of
a
pattern
it's
rather
difficult
to
assume
that
a
district
judge
could
not
find
on
a
preliminary
injunction
that
two
out
of
eight
months
was
not
--
we
had
not
proved
this
intent
sufficiently.
mr.
david
ferber
no
your
honor,
i
would
not
say
so.
mr.
david
ferber
if
it
were
--
if
the
practice
were
followed
and
by
reason
of
some
unusual
circumstances
each
time
the
market
went
down
instead
of
going
up,
which
it
did
invariably
in
these
situations
under
which
it
normally
does
but
--
mr.
david
ferber
well
i
can't
concede
that
because
all
i
know
from
the
record
in
this
case
and
from
the
authorities
we
cite
is
that
there
will
be
a
little
bump
in
the
particular
stock
after
a
recommendation
of
this
sort.
mr.
david
ferber
i
think
it
would
still
be
a
fraudulent
if
this
were
the
attempt
whether
or
not
the
man
actually
--
mr.
david
ferber
well,
since
he
is
recommending
for
a
long-term
gain
i
am
not
sure
it
would
be
on
that
basis,
but
i
do
think
that
if
we
did
show
this
pattern
being
followed,
of
course
he
--
in
other
words
if
he
were
trying
to
get
out
at
the
least
loss
and
if
you
look
like
the
market
is
something
very
terrific,
it
hit
the
market
so
that
declaration
of
war
or
something
of
this
sort
so
that
we
are
going
down
quickly
i
think
that
would
not
prevent
it
from
being
fraud,
the
fact
that
he
did
not
make
any
profits
in
the
particular.
mr.
david
ferber
i
agree
the
people
who
are
defrauded
are
the
persons
who
are
relying
upon
the
investment
advice,
the
people
who
expect
to
get
--
mr.
david
ferber
they
expect
to
get
completely
disinterested
investment
advice
that's
what
they
are
paying
for,
that's
what
they
are
going
to
put
their
money
into
securities
on
the
basis
of
getting.
mr.
david
ferber
well
the
only
indication
was
the
essential
conflict
of
the
position
that
the
advisor
put
himself
here.
mr.
david
ferber
let
me
give
you
some
illustrations.
i
think
that
we
all
agree
and
certainly
the
court
below
did
that
in
the
type
of
case
which
that
you
have
in
ridgely
against
keene
situation
where
a
man
is
paid
to
give
certain
advice
even
though
it's
his
best
advice,
i
mean
he
says
it
was
honest
advice
i
would
have
give
it
in
anyway,
i
think
we
all
agree
that
that's
fraudulent
because
of
the
possible
conflict,
what's
he
going
to
do
the
next
time,
is
he
going
to
look
around
for
a
stock
that
maybe
somebody
will
pay
him
to
recommend.
similarly
here
suppose
the
man
purchases
his
stock,
in
this
case,
and
one
of
them
the
united
fruit
transaction
he
put
in
a
$117,000
of
his
money
buying
the
security
and
then
he
recommended
it
a
few
days
later.
now
suppose
during
those
few
days
he
heard
something
that
indicated
that
the
earnings
were
going
to
fall
of
the
united
fruit,
suppose
he
played
golf
with
the
competitor
and
the
competitor
told
him
something
about
that
we
have
new
invention
that's
going
to
put
these
people
out
of
business
then
what
does
he
do?
does
he
still
let
his
recommendation
go
out
or
does
he
hold
it?
now
maybe,
maybe
he
is
sufficiently
honest,
but
he
won't
send
out
the
recommendation,
but
shouldn't
the
person
who
is
paying
for
the
service
knows
that
–
know
that
he
follows
that
practice,
and
further
more
he
might
have
the
situation
where
he,
as
i
said,
he
generally
recommended
one
stock
each
month,
there
might
have
been
three
or
four
stocks
that
all
looked
pretty
good
for
a
long-term
gain.
and
in
determining
which
one
he
would
recommend,
he
decided
to
take
the
one
that
was
more
volatile
that
had
–
that
would
probably
lend
itself
more
to
scalp.
now
this
maybe
even
an
unconscious
choice
on
his
part,
but
if
he
is
doing
that,
if
his
own
interests
might
be
different
from
those
of
his
clients,
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
a
conflict
of
interest
which
must
be
disclosed.
mr.
david
ferber
in
effect
we
are,
we're
arguing
for
a
rule
that
scalping
is
wrong
and
is
fraudulent.
if
--
mr.
david
ferber
that's
right
your
honor,
i
agree
and
we
think
that
congress
did
pass
this
kind
of
a
statute.
this
statute
would
not
have
been
necessary
under
the
common
law
of
definitions
of
fraud
if
--
unless
congress
intended
to
go
this
far.
the
ridgely
against
keene
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
which
was
the
one
where
the
man
is
paid
by
someone
trying
to
form
a
pool
to
give
the
advice
was
one
decided
at
common
law.
and
so
it
is
our
view
that
congress
must
have
intended
to
go
beyond
what
it
had.
just
briefly
if
i
can
emphasis
the
facts
in
this
case
--
mr.
david
ferber
well
if
--
mr.
justice
brennan
i
miss
understood
per
se
if
i
gave
the
latter
impression.
the
--
if
we
could
ever
prove
that
a
person
was
buying
first
then
recommending
for
a
long-term
gain
and
intending
to
sell,
this
we
call
scalping,
and
this
we
say
however
proved
whether
by
a
series
of
transactions
or
by
a
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
think
sir
--
mr.
david
ferber
exactly,
yes
that
is
the
distinction
i
was
trying
to
make.
now
while
there
are
arguments
here
in
the
respondent's
brief
as
to
the
facts
in
this
case
the
basic
facts
are
not
disputed.
it
is
not
disputed
that
about
once
a
month
these
recommendations
were
made
to
purchase
a
security
for
long-term
gain
to
5000
paid
subscribers.
now
they
point
out
that
they
dispute
to
how
many
other
people
this
recommendation
went
out.
there
was
another
service
that
they
supply
and
sometimes
the
recommendation
went
out
to
the
20,000
subscribers
to
that
service
and
sometimes
even
more
people,
but
they
point
out
that
in
those
situations
it
is
argued
we
give
our
subscribers
to
this
service
a
chance
to
buy
first.
in
another
words,
they
hold
up
the
service.
the
recommendations
here
are
set
forth
in
the
record,
following
page
34
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
the
print
came
out
so
light
and
so
tiny
that
it
might
be
well
to
read
to
you
the
language
at
the
bottom
of
34
which
is
the
respondent's
own
characterization
of
this
service.
an
investment
service
devoted
exclusively
to
one
the
protection
of
investment
capital,
two
the
realization
of
a
steady
and
attractive
income
there
from,
and
three
the
accumulation
of
capital
gains
through
the
timely
purchase
of
corporate
equities
that
are
proved
to
be
undervalued.
and
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
not
devoted
exclusively
to
these
matters
when
the
service
is
also
used
to
provide
a
basis
for
the
scalping
activities,
the
trading
activities
of
the
respondent.
the
charts
dealing
with
the
--
what
did
happen
in
a
market
each
time
are
set
forth
at
pages
15
of
the
record
and
thereafter.
and
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
you
could
almost
pick
what
is
the
mailing
date
of
the
report
even
if
it
weren't
written
on
each
of
these
because
on
every
occasion
the
volume
increased
greatly
generally
two,
three,
or
four
times
that's
what
it
did
and
in
each
case
except
where
a
security
was
disparaged
and
price
went
down,
the
price
rose
to
several
points
usually.
for
example
in
the
united
fruit
case
which
is
on
page
15,
the
closing
for
the
week
or
two
before
had
ranged
from
21
and
an
8
to
22
and
three
8s
and
then
the
week
following
the
close
got
to
25
and
a
8
and
then
began
slowly
to
get
down
following
the
mailing
the
date
the
report
and
this
was
the
security
in
which
a
$117,000
was
invested.
i
mean
these
were
just
tiny
sums
this
man
was
putting
in.
in
addition
as
i
think
i
made
clear
on
one
occasion
where
this
chock
full
o'nuts
where
the
security
was
disparaged
instead
of
buying
in
advance,
he
sold
short
and
covered
subsequently.
we
have
a
chart
on
our
brief,
at
pages
6
and
7
which
indicate
the
purchase
price
and
the
dates
recommended
and
the
selling
price
and
profits.
respondents
do
not
dispute
the
accuracy
of
this
chart
except
as
to
the
profit
figures
in
one
or
--
in
several
of
the
instances
and
these
are
generally
because
they
either
have
additional
transactions
or
in
one
situation
it's
chock
full
o'nuts
where
they
bought
puts
that
is
options
to
sell,
they
apparently
did
not
sell
quickly
enough,
but
held
them
until
the
market
had
come
back.
the
fact
that
an
investment
advisor
is
in
a
confidential
relationship
with
the
persons
he
advises
was
conceded
by
the
court
below.
the
cases
in
the
matter
of
--
seen
in
the
lower
courts,
all
seem
to
hold
this.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
shows
that
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
was
to
remove
conflicts
of
interests
between
the
investment
counsel
and
the
clients.
the
respondents
say
only
one
thing
and
that
is
their
advice
and
it's
our
view
that
anything
which
interferes
with
the
disinterestedness
of
that
advice
must
be
disclosed.
the
--
certain
of
the
other
acts
have
in
addition
to
these
two
provisions,
an
additional
provision
with
respect
to
permissions
to
state,
it
is
our
position,
however,
that
in
circumstances
not
dissimilar
from
this
the
courts
have
generally
held
that
the
violation
was
not
only
of
that
provision
but
also
of
these.
presumably
and
there
is
a
nothing
we
could
find
in
the
legislative
history
that
explains
it
that
presumably
advisors
particularly
many
who
get
out
of
list
of
best
buys
and
so
forth
were
concerned
that
they
would
have
to
get
a
–
in
effect
a
prospectus
out
on
every
security
that
they
were
recommending
whereas
many
of
their
clients
merely
wanted
to
know
good
buys
and
bad
buys
or
good
to
sell
and
so
forth.
i
would
like
to
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
basic
reason.
i
should
say
also,
however,
that
this
court
in
the
joiner
case
did
make
the
point
that
the
expressio
unius
doctrine
does
not
apply
to
the,
at
least
the
provisions
of
the
securities
act
there
involved,
that
the
court
will
treat
the
statute
in
accordance
with
the
way
it
was
intended.
also
as
judge
clarke
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
those
sections
are
tied
to
obtain
money
or
property
without
disclosing.
now
these
people,
expect
for
the
$18
subscription
service,
are
not
obtaining
money
or
property
in
the
sense
of
selling
them
stock.
the
real
evil
via
statute
was
aimed
at
i
believe
was
primarily
not
to
have
people
waste
their
funds
in
securities
that
are
recommended
which
are
not
upon
the
basis
of
the
best
recommendation
of
the
advisor.
and
in
that
connection
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
while
it
is
argued
in
my
opponent's
brief
that
these
people
had
the
opportunity
to
profit
and
that
chart
is
shown
based
on
post
record
prices
what
there
is
–
is
in
this
chart
is
merely
the
subsequent
high
that
there
ever
was.
for
example
they
point
out
in
the
united
fruit
case
that
it
could
have
been
still
bought
at
twenty
two-and-three
quarters
and
sold
at
thirty-and-a-half,
but
after
the
six
months
had
lapsed
for
which
the
recommendation
was
made,
the
price
was
around
15
and
17,
in
other
words,
a
loss
of
around
35%.
what
they
are
saying
is,
that
if
somebody
sold
at
the
top
of
the
market
the
subsequent
market
from
that
day
till
this
there
might
have
been
a
profit,
but
they
never
told
them
when
to
sell,
they
don't
claim
that
they
said
so
at
a
particular
time.
they
might
also
have
sold
at
the
low
of
the
subsequent
market,
and
they
would
not
be
necessarily
well
off.
mr.
david
ferber
the
record
does
not
show
that
justice
harlan,
but
since
this
was
in
eight
months
period
i
would
assume
that
there
were
probably
two
other,
two
other
recommendations
made
whether
we
–
our
investigation
had
time
to
turn
up
any
scalping
with
respect
to
them
or
whether
there
was
none
involved
i
do
not
know.
mr.
david
ferber
actually
there
is
an
individual
and
a
corporation
of
which
he
owns
all
the
stock.
the
corp
of
the
--
i
believe
it
was
all
bought
and
sold
in
the
name
of
the
corporation
through
six
different
brokers.
mr.
david
ferber
that's
right
your
honor
so
far
as
i
know
it
was
not.
of
course
this
was
not
public
material.
a
person
subscribing
to
the
service
couldn't
go
a
broker
dealer
and
say
please
tell
me
what
capital
gain
he
is
doing
so
to
the
extent
that
they
are
--
mr.
david
ferber
if
the
broker
dealer
talked.
i
would
assume
that
is
not
up
to
a
broker
dealer
to
be
talking
about
who
is
--
mr.
david
ferber
that
broker
dealer
would
know
and
there
were
six
broker
dealers
whether
they
were
separate
ones
for
the
different
transactions
or
split
among
the
same
purchase
of
the
same
stock
is
not
clear
from
the
record.
mr.
david
ferber
no
your
honor.
mr.
david
ferber
there
is
not
and
it
only
on
the
basis
of
the
potential
conflict
that
we
say
that
we
don't
know
you
can
never
know
whether
it
was
the
best
recommendation.
mr.
david
ferber
you
mean
such
as
the
situation
i
suggested?
mr.
david
ferber
no,
your
honor
it
would
be
i
think
impossible
for
example
pick
the
situation
of
the
man
where
--
meets
the
competitor
on
the
golf
course
i
mean
this
is
the
type
of
think
we
just
would
not
be
able
to
turn
up
normally
in
any
investigation.
mr.
david
ferber
there
is
no,
no
allegation.
whether
or
not
they
would
have
done
better
had
he
not
been
in
this
practice,
whether
he
would
have
recommended
other
securities
that
might
have
done
better
is
purely
speculative.
mr.
david
ferber
actually
at
the
time
our
injunction
action
was
brought
for
six
months
for
which
they
were
to
have
purchased
the
security
had
not
expired.
so
that
presumably
there
were
holding
the
securities,
then
it
would
have
been
impossible.
mr.
david
ferber
the
time
it
came
to
the
court
below.
thank
you.
