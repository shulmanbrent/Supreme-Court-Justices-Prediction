mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
at
bar
is
a
civil
antitrust
case.
it's
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
which
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court.
the
trial
judge,
if
the
court
please,
had
directed
a
verdict
for
the
defendants
at
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff's
case
thereby
taking
the
case
away
from
the
jury.
with
the
court's
indulgence
and
for
convenience
of
identification,
i
shall
refer
to
the
petitioner,
if
i
may,
as
the
plaintiff
and
the
respondents
as
the
defendants.
the
plaintiff
in
the
court
below
was
an
exhibitor
of
motion
pictures,
first
run
motion
pictures
in
the
city
of
philadelphia,
the
viking
theatre
company.
the
defendants,
if
the
court
please,
were
the
seven
major
distributors
of
motion
pictures
in
the
united
states,
paramount,
warner
brothers,
columbia,
universal,
mgm,
united
artist,
and
twentieth
century-fox
and
three
chain
exhibitors
which
operated
first
run
houses
in
the
city
of
philadelphia,
william
goldman
theatres,
which
operated
the
midtown,
the
randolph
and
the
goldman
theaters,
stanley-warner,
which
operated
the
mastbaum,
the
stanley
and
the
stanton
and
fox
philadelphia
building,
incorporated,
an
affiliate
of
the
national
theaters
chain
which
operated
the
fox
theater.
there
were
some
other
very
small
independent
exhibitors
in
the
philadelphia
area.
the
arcadia
and
the
trans-lux,
each
of
which
had
theaters
with
seating
capacity
around
650,
in
the
case
of
the
trans-lux,
493
and
two
other
theaters,
the
studio
and
the
world,
which
although
included
by
the
defendants
as
first
run
philadelphia
houses,
actually
showed
only
six
first
run
films
during
the
123-week
period
involved
in
this
case.
they
usually
showed
reissues
or
art
films.
the
thrust
of
the
complaint
below
was
that
the
defendants
and
each
of
them
were
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
violative
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws
injurious
to
the
plaintiff
from
july
2nd,
1954
to
november
12
of
1956.
the
defendant
exhibitors,
if
the
court
please,
dominated
the
philadelphia
first
run
exhibition
business,
as
the
record
shows,
controlling
83%
of
all
seats
available
for
first
run
motion
picture
exhibition
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
now,
the
issue
in
the
case,
as
presented
to
this
court,
is
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
made
a
prima
facie
case
entitling
him
to
have
this
case
decided
by
the
jury,
whether
or
not
a
jury
of
reasonable
men
from
the
evidence
in
the
record
could
have
concluded
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
an
injury
to
this
plaintiff.
it's
axiomatic
that
on
an
issue
of
this
kind,
all
reasonable
inferences
should
be
drawn
in
favor
of
the
party
plaintiff
and
adverse
to
the
parties
than
officiary
to
the
directed
verdict.
it's
my
purpose,
if
the
court
please,
in
the
time
that's
allotted
to
me,
to
cut
through
the
mulish
of
economic
(inaudible)
this
record
and
point
out
to
this
court
that
there
is
clear,
direct
evidence
of
an
agreement
and
an
unlawful
agreement
to
which
each
of
the
parties,
defendant
in
this
case,
were
parties.
i
think
it's
--
it's
not
an
overstatement
to
say
that
this
case
is
almost
unique
in
the
long
annals
of
motion
picture
antitrust
litigation
because
we
are
here
not
relying
on
--
on
inferences
from
conduct
or
on
conscious
parallelism
of
conduct.
we're
here
saying,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
is
in
this
record
direct
evidence
of
an
agreement
that
is
unlawful
per
se.
and
secondly,
while
the
end
object
of
this
agreement
was
economic
homicide
for
this
plaintiff,
it
was
not
direct
sudden
homicide
of
a
readily
demonstrable
nature
but
rather
a
slow
lingering
type
induced
by
creeping
pellagra
caused
by
a
carefully
planned
dietary
deficiency.
now,
i'd
like,
in
the
first
instance,
to
touch
upon
the
evidence
in
the
record
of
the
agreement
among
the
defendants,
it's
unlawfulness,
how
it
worked
in
theory
and
what's
its
purpose
was
and
then
point
out
to
the
court
an
invidious
refinement
of
this
agreement
known
as
the
schwalberg
agreement
and
then
showed
to
the
court
from
the
record
how
the
agreement
worked
in
operation
vis-à-vis
the
plaintiff.
before
the
viking
theatre
came
into
the
philadelphia
market
for
first
run
motion
picture
exhibition,
the
stanley-warner
chain
had
five
first
run
theatres
in
philadelphia.
goldman
had
three,
fox,
one.
stanley-warner
converted
its
boyd
theatre
from
a
first
run
theatre
into
a
cinerama
house,
selling
reserved
seats,
thereby
taking
it
out
of
the
first
run
motion
picture
exhibition
business.
it
then
closed
its
alden
theatre,
bringing
about
a
position
of
perfect
parody
between
it
and
goldman,
each
then
had
three
first
run
houses
in
philadelphia.
fox
had
one.
at
this
point,
an
agreement
was
entered
into
and
this
is
undisputed.
there
is
no
dispute
from
the
defendants
concerning
this.
an
agreement
was
entered
into
between
stanley-warner
and
goldman
that
they
would
not
compete
against
each
other
for
acquisition
of
film
from
the
distributors
that
they
would
draw
a
list.
on
one
side
of
the
list
would
be
pictures
allocated
to
goldman,
on
the
other
side
of
the
list
would
be
pictures
allocated
to
stanley-warner.
sometimes
a
list
would
be
drawn
by
goldman
in
which
case
stanley-warner
had
its
first
pick
and
sometimes,
the
list
would
be
drawn
by
stanley-warner
in
which
case
goldman
would
have
his
first
pick
and
in
some
instances,
the
lists
were
drawn
by
the
distributors
because
in
this
--
in
this
agreement,
the
distributors
acquiesced.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
did
under
the
shwalberg
agreement
which
i'll
come
to.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
right,
sir.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
said,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
distributors
gave
their
approbation
and
their
acquiescence
to
this
agreement.
there
was
no
dissent
from
the
distributors
and
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
paramount
and
united
artists,
they
actually
drew
the
lists.
in
volume
6
of
the
record,
over
a
period
of
about
30
pages
or
a
space
of
about
30
pages,
there
is
a
physical
exhibit
showing
the
split,
showing
how
it
was
done.
the
first
page
of
volume
6
shows
the
paramount
split
and
on
one
side,
ours,
on
the
other
side,
goldman,
that's
a
split
that
was
drawn
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
of
course
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
of
course,
they
could
easily
have
complained
and
they
had
ready
basis
for
complaint
under
the
antitrust
laws
but
they
do
not
complain.
in
fact,
they
urged
this
court
to
approve
this
split
arrangement
among
these
exhibitors
and
in
fact,
they
approved
of
it
at
the
time
that
it
was
in
existence
in
philadelphia.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir,
and
you'll
see
that
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
they
--
they
not
only
fail
to
act
against
it,
they
cooperated
throughout
with
it.
its
--
the
record
will
show
as
i
unfold
it
to
you,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
don't
deny
it,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
admitted
and
defended.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
court
to
approve
it.
yes,
sir.
now,
how
did
fox
fit
into
this
split?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
i
--
i
shall
do
that.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'll
--
i'll
show
you
how
it
--
it
heard
him.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
it
was
passed
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice
white.
it
refused
to
hold
the
split
agreement
unlawful.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
oh,
the
question
of
damage,
no,
sir.
that
was
not
pointed.
that
was
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
not
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
course
of
damage,
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
that's
right,
sir.
now,
how
did
fox
fit
into
this?
i'd
like
to
describe
the
split
first
and
then
show
its
operation.
fox
fitted
in
this
way.
fox
took
only
pictures
from
twentieth
century-fox.
and
it
agreed
that
it
would
not
compete
for
the
pictures
from
the
other
distributors.
it
would
leave
the
pictures
from
the
other
distributors
to
goldman
and
stanley-warner.
and
in
return
for
that,
goldman
and
stanley-warner
did
not
compete
for
fox
pictures,
so
that
fox,
for
all
practical
purposes
insofar
as
the
parties
to
this
litigation
were
concerned,
had
a
virtual
monopoly
on
pictures
coming
from
twentieth
century-fox.
now,
viking
came
into
the
market
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir,
that
--
that
did
happen
and
i'll
explain
how
it
happened
as
we
go
into
the
evidence.
there
were
times,
mr.
justice
stewart,
when
there
were
too
many
twentieth
century-fox
pictures
for
the
fox
theatre
and
then
on
those
occasions,
they
allowed
other
exhibitors
in
the
philadelphia
area
to
show
fox
pictures.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
fox
and
--
fox
theatre
and
twentieth
century-fox.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
the
record
would
show
that
each
of
them
showed
at
least
one
or
more,
in
fact,
viking
showed
some
fox
pictures
during
this
period.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
viking
did,
in
fact,
did
on
fox
pictures.
now,
i'll
show
you
what
happened
when
those
--
this
remained
as
we
go
into
the
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
that's
right.
now,
viking
came
into
operation
this
way.
when
the
alden
theatre
was
closed
by
stanley-warner
bringing
it
into
perfect
position
of
parity
with
goldman,
mr.
harry
sley
of
philadelphia,
the
president
of
the
viking
corporation,
purchased
the
alden
theatre.
as
soon
as
he
manifested
an
intension
to
operate
it
as
a
theatre,
immediately,
stanley-warner
undertook
negotiations
to
buy
it
back.
however,
the
record
shows
that
he
spent
some
$600,000
refurbishing
it
and
making
it
into
one
of
the
finest
theatres
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
for
first
run
motion
picture
exhibition,
and
then
notified
each
of
the
distributors
that
he
intended
to
compete
for
film
in
the
philadelphia
market
and
to
operate
it
as
a
first
run
house.
so
when
viking
came
into
business
on
july
2nd
of
1954,
it
entered
into
a
split
market.
it
entered
into
a
market
wherein
certain
films
were
split
on
the
goldman
side,
certain
on
stanley-warner
and
the
twentieth
century-fox
films
were
reserved
for
the
fox
theatre.
so
viking
immediately
found
that
every
time
it
came
into
the
market
for
a
picture,
it
was
in
a
competitive
market.
it
had
to
compete
against
one
of
the
major
exhibitors
for
film,
whereas
when
viking
got
a
film
and
was
committed
for
a
period
of
weeks
to
play
it,
the
other
defendant
exhibitors
enjoyed
a
competitive
low
in
the
philadelphia
market
and
were
able
to
get
their
pictures
without
competition
from
viking.
so,
a
vicious
cycle
set
in.
the
higher
that
viking
bid
and
the
longer
the
playing
commitments
that
it
made,
the
longer
the
competitive
low
it
made
in
the
--
in
the
market
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
inuring
to
the
advantage
of
the
defendant
exhibitors
so
that
they
could
get
stronger
while
viking
grew
weaker
to
use
a
homely
analogy.
assume
that
here,
in
the
city
of
washington,
we
had
three
retailers
of
coal,
a,
b
and
c,
a
with
three
large
storage
bins,
b
with
three
large
storage
bins
and
c
with
one
storage
bin.
a
and
b
entered
into
an
agreement
that
they
won't
compete
against
each
other
in
buying
coal
from
the
wholesalers.
now,
what
does
this
mean?
it
means
that
every
time
c
goes
into
the
market
to
buy
coal
from
a
wholesaler
for
its
bin,
it's
got
to
compete
against
a
or
b.
when
a
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
right.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
just
against
one.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
so
when
a's
bin
is
filled,
if
the
court
please
--
when
c's
bin
is
filled,
a
and
b
then
have
a
period
of
competitive
tranquility.
there
is
no
competition
for
the
acquisition
of
coal
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
and
whereas
c
must
pay
competitive
prices,
let's
assume
$20
a
ton,
when
it
fills
its
bin,
a
and
b,
during
the
period
when
c
is
filled,
can
buy
their
coal
at
noncompetitive
prices,
say
$15
a
ton,
and
if
the
retail
price
is
$20
a
ton,
with
the
expiration
of
the
year,
you
can
see
that
c
is
constantly
buying
its
coal
at
$20
a
ton,
selling
it
at
$20
a
ton
and
you
have
economic
ruin
at
the
end
of
the
year
whereas
a
and
b
can
survive
because
they
have
periods
when
they
can
buy
their
coal
at
noncompetitive
prices
and
sell
it
at
a
profit.
this
split
agreement,
if
the
court
please,
is
nothing
more
than
a
very,
very
thinly
veiled
device
to
circumvent
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
made
four
times
with
respect
to
pooling
agreements
for
purchasing
film.
the
first
time
it
was
made
--
it
was
made
in
the
crescent
amusement
case,
united
states
against
crescent
amusement
company
in
1944
where
the
court
struck
down
an
agreement
whereby
a
number
of
exhibitors
vended
together
and
designated
a
common
purchasing
agent
to
acquire
film
from
the
distributors.
and
the
court
struck
it
down
because
they
were
ally.
they
had
coerced
all
of
their
economic
power
into
one
market,
allied
against
the
--
the
nonmember
exhibitors.
again,
it
spoke
in
united
states
against
griffith
in
1948
against
these
pooling
agreements
among
exhibitors
for
the
purchase
of
film.
it
spoke
again
in
1948
in
shine
--
schine
theatre
against
the
united
states
and
finally
in
the
paramount
case
in
1948,
it
said
that
these
pooling
agreements
were
illegal
because
they
used
the
language
of
the
court.
they
have
the
effect
of
nullifying
competition
between
the
allied
theatres
and
of
making
more
effective
the
competition
of
the
group
against
theatres
not
members
of
the
pool.
clear
restraints
of
trade
are
difficult
to
imagine.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
your
honor,
i
haven't
been
able
to
get
an
expression
of
opinion
from
them
on
this
subject
so
i
don't
know
whether
they
agree
or
don't
agree
and
the
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
have
not,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no.
they
have
said,
your
--
mr.
justice
white,
with
respect
to
two
splits,
one
in
alpine,
texas
and
the
other
in
wichita
falls,
texas,
one
city
which
had
two
exhibitors
and
the
others
which
had
three
that
all
inclusive
splits
were
all
right.
in
other
words,
splits
from
which
no
exhibitor
was
excluded
but
they
have
specifically
refused
to
give
their
benediction
to
a
split
arrangement
from
which
any
exhibitor
has
been
excluded
as
viking
was
excluded
in
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
i
don't
like
to
make
that
jump
because
i've
tried
to
get
them
to
express
themselves
on
this
subject
unsuccessfully.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
department
of
justice
has
not
taken
the
position
insofar
as
i
know,
mr.
justice
white,
with
respect
to
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
to
splits,
with
respect
to
--
which
some
exhibitor
has
been
excluded.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
know
that
the
judge
is
extremely
interested
in
what
this
court
says
about
the
splits
but
i
don't
know
what
his
position
is.
i
have
no
firsthand
information
on
that.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
--
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
split
arrangement
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
device
to
circumvent
the
ruling
of
this
court
on
pooling
arrangements
because
the
split
has
exactly
the
same
effect
as
the
pooling
arrangement.
number
one,
it
eliminates
competition
against
otherwise
competitive
exhibitors.
number
two,
it
allocates
product
without
competition.
and
number
three,
it
affects
prices.
now,
what
these
--
what
these
exhibitors
did,
if
the
court
please,
was
to
create
in
the
philadelphia
area
three
submarkets.
they
divided
the
market.
in
one
submarket
were
all
the
pictures
on
the
goldman
side
of
the
split.
in
another
submarket
were
all
the
pictures
on
the
stanley-warner
side
of
the
split.
and
the
other
submarkets
were
those
pictures
which
were
allocated
without
competition
to
fox.
then
these
exhibitors
channeled
their
total
market
power.
in
the
case
of
goldman,
he
put
his
total
market
power
into
this
submarket
which
included
those
pictures
on
his
side
of
the
split.
stanley-warner
gave
him
no
competition,
fox
gave
him
no
competition,
so
that
the
arithmetic
as
shown
in
our
brief
at
page
14
was
that
--
whereas
he
might
have
had
only
22%
of
the
market
power
in
a
free
open
competitive
market
where
he
was
competing
with
equal
or
nearly
equal
competitors
when
he
went
into
this
submarket
and
competed
against
the
small
independence,
he
had
80%
of
the
--
of
the
market
power
measured
in
terms
of
seating
capacity
from
the
philadelphia
area.
so,
if
the
court
please,
we
have
here
a
classic
division
of
the
market
case.
we
have
the
philadelphia
market
divided
into
submarkets.
we
have
each
of
them
--
defendant
exhibitors
coercing
their
total
economic
power,
their
market
power
into
a
submarket
against
wholly
unequal
independent
exhibitors
without
any
competition
from
the
other
nearly
equal
or
coequal
chain
exhibitors
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
now,
that
is
just
precisely
the
kind
of
thing
which
the
attorney
general's
national
antitrust
advisory
committee
spoke
out
against
several
years
ago.
and
they
said
the
contracting
parties
to
such
a
market
division
gained
only
if
the
result
is
to
give
each
a
substantial
degree
of
power
in
his
own
market.
there
is
no
doubt
either
as
a
matter
of
principle
or
precedent
that
agreements
among
competitors
for
market
division
should
be
and
are
treated
like
price
arrangements.
now,
when
you
add
this
fact
to
it,
if
the
court
please,
here,
these
three
party
exhibitors
had
films
from
which
no
competition
would
emanate
from
the
other
party
defendants.
you'll
add
this
fact
that
sometimes
they
got
film
on
their
side
of
the
split
which
they
really
didn't
even
want.
but
what
did
they
do?
notwithstanding
that
fact,
they
still
bid
on
it.
why?
because
when
they
bid
on
it,
they
drove
viking
up
in
order
to
get
pictures.
they
drove
up
the
small
independents'
--
the
small
independents'
advice
even
though
they
didn't
want
the
picture
itself
and
if
the
court
would
look
at
page
102
of
the
record,
you
--
you
have
that
testimony
quite
clear
from
mr.
fabian
of
stanley-warner
who
said,
"some
of
the
pictures
we
never
even
wanted
after
they
were
split.
they
weren't
suitable.
but
then
the
other
exhibitor
in
the
territory
wanted
the
picture,
we
would
be
as
a
rule
for
us
to
bid
against
it,"
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
didn't
want
it.
now,
if
the
court
please,
this
is
the
way
the
split
arrangement
operated
vis-à-vis
viking.
but
in
addition
to
the
split
of
product,
in
addition
to
the
split
of
product
in
the
philadelphia
area,
there
was,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
an
invidious
refinement
of
this
split
agreement
called
the
schwalberg
agreement.
now,
with
respect
to
the
schwalberg
agreement,
not
even
the
defendants
are
audacious
enough
to
defend
its
legality.
but
they
adopt
a
sort
of
evidentiary
myopia
with
respect
to
it
and
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
it
was
operative,
that
it
actually
was
put
into
operation.
and
i'd
like
now
to
address
the
court's
attention
to
the
schwalberg
agreement,
what
it
was
and
how
it
operated
and
show
that
it
did
in
fact
operate
and
there
was
evidence
in
this
record
that
it
operated
across
the
board.
first
of
all,
volume
6
of
the
record,
plaintiff's
exhibit
number
8
at
page
2393,
we
have
a
letter
from
the
vice
president
of
paramount
to
the
president
of
paramount.
this
is
an
exhibit
in
evidence
in
the
record.
"dear
george,
the
so-called
schwalberg
agreement,
with
goldman
of
philadelphia,
envisaged
an
equal
division
qualitatively
and
quantitatively
of
our
product
between
goldman
and
stanley-warner
in
philadelphia.
under
this
arrangement,
bids
were
invited
from
stanley-warner
and
goldman
as
well
as
other
theatres
in
philadelphia
requesting
a
bid
invitation.
if
any
bid
was
acceptable,
the
acceptance
closes
the
sales
file.
if
no
bid
was
acceptable,
paramount
agreed
to
negotiate
with
either
stanley-warner
or
goldman
governed
by
whether
the
individual
picture
was
on
goldman's
or
stanley-warner's
split.
my
understanding
is
that
we
were
not
permitted
if
all
bids
were
rejected
to
negotiate
with
the
unsuccessful
bidders
or
any
other
theatre
that
did
not
offer
a
bid.
we
were
obligated
upon
rejection
of
all
bids
to
negotiate
with
one
of
the
other
and
i'm
told
that
in
one
or
more
cases,
the
negotiated
deal
was
reviewed
or
adjusted.
this
arrangement,
whether
authorized
or
not,
was
actually
in
effect."
now,
what
did
mr.
schwalberg
say
about
this
agreement?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
in
volume
6,
mr.
justice
harlan,
at
page
2393.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
was
still
quoting,
sir,
yes,
from
the
exhibit.
now,
at
volume
4
at
page
1834,
we
have
mr.
schwalberg's
testimony
on
this
subject.
mr.
schwalberg
said,
"yes,
mr.
goldman
took
this
position."
he
said
he
would
not
make
any
formal
bids
if
an
exhibitor
came
in
and
requested
an
opportunity,
and
that
picture
was
put
on
the
block.
he
let
it
be
known
he
wasn't
going
to
bid
because
this
is
the
thing
he
sought
to
do
away
with
and
he
was
not
going
to
go
back
on
it.
he
said,
however,
if
we
found
that
bids
received
did
not
measure
up
to
our
national
policy
of
what
we
thought
of
the
picture
and
we
wanted
to
come
back
to
him
and
he
negotiated
a
deal
and
that
deal
was
equal
to
or
better
than
national
policy,
he
didn't
want
paramount
to
take
that
bid
and
go
across
the
street
and
try
to
better
it.
did
you
agree
to
that?
answer,
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
at
page
1834,
mr.
justice
black.
then
again,
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
the
defendants
and
their
officers
were
totally
devoid
--
totally
devoid
of
the
noble
emotion
with
respect
to
the
small
independent
exhibitor
in
the
philadelphia
area
because
at
page
1924,
we
have
mr.
minsky,
an
officer
of
the
paramount
company
speaking
with
respect
to
the
arrangement
in
philadelphia
and
this
is
what
he
says,
talking
about
the
last
part
of
1955,
"so
i
went
to
my
home
office
and
spoke
with
those
executives
under
whom
i
work
and
i
said
to
them
that
i
would
like
to
have
the
privilege
of
doing
something
unusual.
and
coming
back
to
philadelphia
and
offering
to
all
the
first
run
theatres
in
philadelphia
an
opportunity
to
share
in
paramount
pictures
on
both
the
quantity
and
quality
basis
and
i
was
given
such
approval."
question,
"excuse
me,
when
you
say
share,
do
you
mean?"
answer,
"i
mean
the
split."
question,
"in
the
same
way
that
goldman
and
stanley-warner
had
a
split?"
"yes,
sir."
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
mr.
howard
minsky,
the
district
manager
for
paramount
in
the
philadelphia
area,
mr
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
president
of
paramount,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
president
of
paramount.
now,
plaintiff's
exhibit
7,
which
is
in
volume
6.
and
--
and
how,
in
the
name
of
reason,
the
defendants
can
say
that
the
schwalberg
agreement
was
not
in
--
in
effect
in
the
light
of
plaintiff's
exhibit
7,
which
appears
at
page
2391,
is
beyond
comprehension
because
here,
we
have
a
letter
from
the
president
--
the
new
president
of
--
of
paramount,
mr.
--
mr.
weltner
to
mr.
william
goldman.
this
is
dated
december
12,
1955,
and
he
says,
"dear
bill,
at
our
conference
at
the
hotel
plaza
last
thursday
in
which
harry
calman
and
louis
phillips
were
also
present,
you
turn
to
me
and
said,
"george,
let's
forget,
there
ever
was
an
agreement
between
paramount
and
me
made
with
al
schwalberg.
i
won't
ever
hold
paramount
to
it.
i
want
to
be
a
paramount
customer.
let's
do
business
with
a
clean
start."
and
then
the
--
the
letter
writer,
mr.
weltner
goes
on
to
say,
"if
this
is
not
accurate
word
for
word,
it
isn't
substance.
i
express
my
appreciation
and
stated
that
we
wanted
you
as
a
customer.
we
then
try
to
work
out
a
formula
that
would
be
mutually
satisfactory
and
practical
and
yet
would
not
put
us
in
a
position
where
anyone
could
rightly
claim
that
we
favored
you
and
discriminated
against
him.
at
this
meeting,
we
could
not
come
up
with
such
a
formula,
one
that
was
satisfactory
to
you."
now,
consider
the
schwalberg
agreement
for
a
moment,
in
the
light
of
the
fact,
that
goldman
wouldn't
bid
on
motion
pictures.
there
are
about
250
pictures
that
were
released
in
the
philadelphia
area
as
shown
by
plaintiff's
exhibit
1,
the
splits,
the
first
--
very
first
part
of
volume
6,
which
were
earmarked
for
goldman.
stanley-warner
couldn't
bid
on
him
because
of
its
agreement,
fox
couldn't
bid
on
him
because
of
its
agreement
and
goldman
wouldn't
bid
on
him
because
goldman
wouldn't
bid
and
this
record
is
ramped
with
statements
from
goldman
that
he
wouldn't
bid.
for
example
with
plaintiff's
exhibit
number
5
in
this
record,
on
one
occasion
when
goldman
made
a
bid,
he
was
so
upset
that
the
fact
didn't
broke
his
policy,
he
never
did
a
bid
but
he
wrote
a
letter
to
paramount's
lawyers
and
he
said,
"this
doesn't
set
any
precedent.
as
you
know,
we
take
the
position
we
are
not
to
bid
on
any
pictures
but
only
to
negotiate
for
them."
so
what
happened
with
respect
to
those
250
pictures?
when
the
distributor
came
in
to
the
philadelphia
market
with
pictures
that
run
the
goldman
side
of
the
split,
he
couldn't
get
a
bid
from
stanley-warner,
he
couldn't
get
a
bid
from
fox
and
he
couldn't
get
one
from
goldman
because
goldman
wouldn't
bid.
so
he
got
one
from
viking
or
trans-lux
or
arcadia
but
obviously,
he
wanted
to
negotiate
with
the
top
chain
exhibitor.
he
then
go
over
to
goldman
and
talk
to
goldman
about
the
picture
and
under
the
schwalberg
agreement,
if
goldman
made
him
an
offer,
he
couldn't
take
the
offer
across
the
street
to
viking
and
give
viking
a
chance
to
need
it
because
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
certainly.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
wouldn't
bid
on
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
viking
could
bid
on
it
but
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
it
certainly
should
be
to
the
interest
of
the
distributor
to
get
the
highest
price.
but
if
he
offered
his
picture
in
a
market,
in
a
submarket
where
he
could
only
get
bids
from
the
small
independents,
obviously,
he
would
want
the
loss
of
economic
preservation
would
indicate
to
him
that
he
ought
to
try
to
get
a
bid
from
goldman,
the
chain
exhibitor
in
the
philadelphia
area.
if
he
went
to
goldman
and
said,
"let's
negotiate
on
it,"
goldman
had
an
agreement
which
said,
"well,
okay,
i'll
negotiate
with
you."
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
he
--
he
did
go
through
the
--
he
did
go
through
the
procedure
of
inviting
bids.
and
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
i
think
we'll
see
as
we
see
the
split
in
operation
that
it
was
in
many
instances
simply
of
a
façade
and
nothing
--
maybe
that's
to
dignify
the
term
for
it
because
in
many
instances,
it
was
a
sham.
the
picture
was
already
awarded
at
the
time
that
viking
was
invited
to
bid
and
i
could
show
you
that
in
the
record
as
we
go
along.
now,
let's
see
the
split
in
operation.
i'll
show
you
one
right
now,
mr.
justice
stewart.
let's
see
this
split
in
operation.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
record
is
very
clear
on
this,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
we've
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
--
well,
we
asked
you
in.
why
didn't
you
come
in?
well,
first
of
all,
the
record
at
pages
974
and
975
show
very
--
shows
very
clearly
that
viking
was
not
invited
into
this
split
until
after
its
lawyers
wrote
letters
to
these
distributors
and
these
other
exhibitors
in
1956,
then
they
were
asked
after
they'd
been
victimized
by
an
illegal
split
over
a
period
of
two
years,
then
they
were
invited
to
join
the
gang.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
of
course,
there
were
certainly
no
obligation
on
them
to
join
something
that
was
per
se
illegal
with
respect
to
the
small
independent
exhibitors
and
it's
been
our
position
from
the
beginning
that
this
is
a
per
se
illegal
violative
agreement.
now,
your
honor,
if
the
court
please,
i
said
that
i
would
show
you
this
--
this
split
in
operation
and
some
of
the
sham
bidding
that
went
on
under
it.
first
of
all,
goldman,
at
page
1661
of
the
record,
conceded
that
he
had
an
arrangement
similar
to
that,
that
he
had
with
paramount
in
effect
with
warner
brothers.
but
let's
look
at
warner
brothers
and
see
the
schwalberg
agreement
and
operation
insofar
as
that
distributor
was
concerned.
a
typical
illustration,
there
was
a
picture
called
a
mcconnell
story.
on
july
15,
viking
was
invited
to
bid
for
that
picture.
it
did.
in
july
19,
1955,
it
received
a
letter
from
warner
brothers
saying,
"we've
given
the
picture
to
goldman."
now,
four
--
that
was
four
days
later.
now,
at
the
trial,
mr.
mansell
of
warner
brothers
said,
"well,
we
gave
that
picture
to
goldman
because
we
wanted
the
picture
shown
in
philadelphia
over
labor
day
and
we
want
it
on
august
25
opening
day."
and
viking
was
committed
until
september
9th.
but
where
did
the
picture
go?
the
picture
went
to
the
goldman
randolph
theatre
which
at
that
time,
was
committed
to
show
a
picture
until
the
29th
day
of
september.
now,
what
did
mr.
mansell
say
at
the
trial?
mr.
mansell
said,
"well,
i
didn't
make
the
decision
to
give
to
goldman
until
mid-august."
but
the
record
shows
that
he
wrote
a
letter
to
viking
on
the
19th
day
of
july
saying,
"too
bad,
it's
not
yours,
it's
goldman's."
mr.
justice
stewart,
an
illustration
of
the
sham
bidding
that
went
on.
if
--
if
you'll
look
at
plaintiff's
exhibit
number
53,
which
is
in
volume
6
at
page
2465,
you'll
see
a
very
dramatic
illustration
of
it.
plaintiff's
exhibit
53
is
a
contract
between
universal
and
the
mastbaum
theatre.
it
gives
the
mastbaum
theatre
a
picture
called
the
helen
beck
and
it
provides
that
helen
beck
will
start
after
mr.
roberts
finishes
at
the
mastbaum
theatre.
when
was
that
contract
entered
into?
on
may
19th
of
1955.
what
happened
then?
the
exhibit
immediately
before
it,
plaintiff's
exhibit
52,
warner
brothers
invited
viking
to
bid
on
mr.
roberts
on
may
23rd,
the
picture
has
already
been
awarded
on
may
19th
to
the
mastbaum
theatre
as
evidenced
by
the
contract
plaintiff's
exhibit
53
and
that's
an
illustration
of
the
sham
bidding
that
went
on
in
the
philadelphia
market
during
this
123-week
period.
now,
with
respect
to
the
picture
serenade
in
pete
kelly's
blues,
viking
bid,
bid
is
rejected.
never
a
chance
was
given
to
viking
to
negotiate
after
the
bids,
the
pictures
went
to
the
goldman
theatre
in
precise
accord
with
the
schwalberg
agreement.
again
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
say,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
all
the
parties
in
this
case
were
parties
to
the
schwalberg
agreement.
goldman
made
in
the
whole
life
of
this
conspiracy
only
11
bids
per
film
and
he
got
134
pictures
all
across
the
board
from
the
distributors
in
this
case
and
i
say
without
the
operation
on
the
schwalberg
agreement
on
across
the
board
basis,
he
couldn't
have
got
those
pictures
without
bidding.
now,
look
again
at
the
united
artist
to
see
the
schwalberg
agreement
in
--
in
operation
with
respect
to
them.
plaintiff's
exhibit
145
a,
b
and
c
show
that
there
were
three
pictures,
barefoot
contessa,
summertime
and
gentlemen
marry
brunettes.
letters
went
out
inviting
bids
on
those
pictures.
they
didn't
go
out
to
stanley-warner
or
goldman
or
fox
because
they
didn't
have
to
bid.they
went
out
to
viking,
they
went
out
to
trans-lux,
arcadia
and
the
little
studio
and
the
world.
they
didn't
even
bother
inviting
bids
from
the
big
three.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
this
was
united
artist.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
what
happened?
all
bids,
of
course,
were
rejected.
and
how
were
the
pictures
allocated?
precisely
according
to
the
split.
barefoot
contessa
went
to
the
midtown,
summertime
to
the
randolph,
both,
goldman
picture
--
theatres
and
gentleman
marry
brunettes
to
the
stanley.
again,
if
the
court
please,
with
respect
to
columbia,
two
pictures,
picnic
and
caine
mutiny,
viking
bid,
bid's
rejected,
pictures
allocated
precisely
according
to
the
split.
now,
with
respect
to
universal,
when
viking
came
into
the
market,
he
wanted
a
chance
to
get
universal
pictures.
he
wrote
a
letter
to
universal
in
april
of
1954.
and
then
it
was
told,
"we
don't
have
any
available."
then
it
wrote
a
letter
in
october
asking
again
for
chance
to
have
pictures.
on
october
26,
a
letter
went
out
from
universal
to
viking,
no
pictures
available.
within
10
days,
five
pictures
were
licensed,
class
183
to
186,
five
pictures
were
licensed
to
the
goldman
theatre
precisely
in
accordance
with
the
split.
again,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
your
honor,
the
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
plaintiff's
exhibit
1
was
an
exhibit
which
was
extracted
under
the
discovery
procedures
in
stanley-warner.
we
have
no
knowledge
whether
these
were
all
the
pictures
that
were
split
but
they're
over
530
as
among
that
split.
and
of
course
that
viking
was
to
get
any
pictures
that
it
come
off
to
splits
because
it's
our
contention
that
virtually,
every
picture
that
went
into
the
city
of
philadelphia
was
split.
and
some
of
the
pictures,
as
mr.
fabian
said
he
didn't
even
want.
but
even
though
he
didn't
want
any
bid
on
them
and
viking
would
make
premium
bids
and
get
some
pictures,
and
that's
why
i
say
it
was
a
carefully
designed
diet
of
malnutrition.
it
was
not
absolute
cutoff
starvation.
that
--
it
was
a
more
sophisticated
form
of
economic
homicide
than
we
usually
see
in
these
cases.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it's
an
economic
murder
case,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
viking
was
free
to
bid,
there's
no
question
about
that.
we
can
contend
otherwise.
but
unfortunately,
mr.
justice
stewart,
some
of
the
exhibitors
didn't
bid
you
see
if
the
picture
was
on
the
goldman.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
because
--
well,
let's
take
for
example
the
--
a
picture
on
the
goldman
split.
stanley-warner
won't
bid.
fox
won't
bid.
and
goldman
won't
bid
because
he's
against
bidding.
so,
the
distributors
then
confronted
with
the
(inaudible)
that
he
must
offer
a
picture
in
the
philadelphia
market
and
he
has
only
the
small
independents
who
have
a
total
of
only
17%
of
all
the
seats
available
first
run
exhibition
in
the
city
of
philadelphia.
he
wants
a
bid
from
goldman,
of
course,
because
goldman
is
a
big
exhibitor.
so
he
rejects
all
bids
and
says,
"i'll
negotiate."
but
if
he
then
negotiates
with
goldman,
this
is
the
end,
it's
a
one
way
street
and
he
finds
himself
in
a
cul-de-sac
because
he
--
he
can't
go
on
and
then
offer
goldman's
terms
back
to
viking
and
give
them
a
chance
to
bid
because
he's
got
the
schwalberg
agreement
which
says,
"once
i
make
a
deal
or
make
an
offer
that's
equivalent
to
your
national
policy
on
this
picture,
you
can't
take
it
across
the
street
and
give
viking
a
chance
for
the
play.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
because
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
because
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
because
it
may
very
well
be
that
first
of
all,
a
picture
on
the
goldman's
side
of
the
split
which
can
attract
no
bids
from
stanley-warner,
fox
and
will
not
attract
them
from
goldman,
maybe
that
the
only
theatre
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
which
is
then
available
for
pictures
to
viking,
so
we
get
a
bid
from
the
viking.
well,
he
wants
to
see
if
he
can
better
it
from
goldman
so
he
goes
to
goldman
and
goldman
tops
the
bid.
but
then
our
complainants
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
negotiation.
he
negotiates.
but
then,
viking
can't
get
a
chance
under
this
agreement
to
top
goldman.
why?
because
he's
bound
once
he
negotiates
with
goldman
to
give
the
picture
to
goldman
and
viking
is,
therefore,
out
of
the
market
for
that
picture
and
can't
get
it
even
though
it
manifested
its
interest
by
a
bid.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
because
he
hopes
to
get
a
better
--
a
better
offer
from
goldman
and
once
he
gets
it,
the
whole
game
is
over
because
it's
future
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
goldman
won't
bid
but
goldman
will
negotiate.
now,
once
goldman
negotiates
and
tops
the
viking
first
bid,
it's
all
over.
you
can't
go
--
viking
can't
get
a
chance
to
that
picture
notwithstanding
that
it
has
manifested
its
interest
by
making
an
open
competitive
bid
form.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
should
be.
yes,
sir.
it
certainly
should
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
it
certainly
--
the
bargaining
we
view
here
appeared
to
be
with
the
chain
exhibitors
because
otherwise,
the
distributors
wouldn't
have
acquiescence
in
this
kind
of
--
of
an
understanding.
but
i
don't
presume
to
explain
why
the
distributors
took
this
position.
there
will
be
--
i'm
sure
there'll
be
explanations
forthcoming.
but
let
me
show
the
court
first
of
all,
what
was
an
egregious
area,
i
believe,
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
discussing
the
schwalberg
agreement.
i
think
that
there's
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
each
distributor
was
a
part
of
the
schwalberg
agreement.
there
was
either
evidence
in
the
record
or
a
valid
proffer.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
say
with
respect
to
the
schwalberg
agreement,
it
says
the
plaintiff
takes
the
position
that
the
agreement
made
by
stanley-warner
and
goldman
with
paramount
so
modified
the
split
as
to
render
it
unlawful
and
that
the
agreement
constitutes
direct
evidence
of
an
illegal
conspiracy.
the
illegality
is
said
to
arise
from
the
requirement
that
paramount
negotiate
exclusively
with
either
stanley-warner
or
goldman
upon
the
rejection
of
all
bids
for
inadequacy.
the
agreement
may
not
be
held
illegal
within
the
framework
of
this
case
unless
the
other
distributors
gave
their
adherence
to
the
plan
who
participated
in
it.
this,
of
course,
violates
a
hornbook
principle
of
law
of
conspiracy
from
its
beginning
in
anglo-saxon
jurisprudence.
it
takes
only
two
to
conspire.
here,
you
had
admittedly
by
the
court
of
appeals
both
the
horizontal
conspiracy
among
the
two
party
exhibitors
and
a
vertical
conspiracy
with
paramount.
and
yet,
they
said
this
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
make
a
prima
facie
case.
now,
let's
look
if
--
if
we
may
at
--
at
how
the
split
operated
in
and
what
happened
to
viking
under
the
split.
the
record
shows
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no.
i
think
that
--
i
said
--
i
think,
mr.
justice
white,
that
i
think
this
is
just
an
artfully
designed
device
to
circumvent
the
pooling
agreement
that
have
been
struck
down
by
this
court
on
four
occasions
where
exhibitors
designate
a
single
agent
to
buy
their
pictures
from
the
distributors.
this
has
the
effect
of
stifling
competition
allocating
product
and
affecting
price.
and
this
is
simply
a
device
which
accomplishes
precisely
the
same
thing
and
attempt
to
circumvent,
to
pronounce
them
to
this
court
on
that
subject.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
we
have
exactly
the
same
results.
now,
what
happened?
in
123
week
period,
viking
got
31
pictures
on
87
bids.
goldman
got
134
pictures
or
45
per
theatre
on
11
bids.
only
one
of
which
was
made
before
the
expiration
of
the
schwalberg
agreement.
stanley-warner
got
291
pictures
or
97
pictures
at
theatre.
now,
it's
a
measure
of
a
film's
economic
worth
is
its
gross
national
film
rental.
that's
the
amount
of
rent
that
the
film
attracts
from
various
theaters
across
the
country
on
its
run
all
over
the
nation.
in
the
jargon
of
the
industry,
a
picture
that
gets
as
much
as
$4
million
of
national
film
rental
is
called
a
blockbuster.
now,
in
a
123-week
period,
viking
got
films
which
aggregated
$45
million
in
national
film
rental.
goldman
got
an
average
of
$71.9
million
per
theatre
and
by,
i
suppose,
a
start
fortuity.
stanley-warner
got
exactly
$72
million.
that's
how
well
the
parody
was
kept
here.
fox
got
$80
million.
how
many
of
these
so-called
blockbusters
did
viking
get
pictures
that
grossed
over
$4
million?
it
got
one
in
a
123-week
period.
stanley-warner
got
13
and
by
another
strange
fortuity,
goldman
got
exactly
13
or
4.3
--
3
per
theatre.
fox
got
4.
how
many
pictures
did
viking
get
that
had
a
national
film
rental
of
over
$3
million?
viking
got
two.
how
many
did
goldman
get?
goldman
got
18
or
6
per
theatre.
stanley
warner
got
20
or
6
and
2/3
per
theatre.
fox
got
9.
then
there
was
a
matter
of
film
adjustments.
a
common
trade
practice
whereby
the
distributor
makes
an
adjustment
downward
for
the
benefit
of
the
exhibitor
plan
--
the
exhibitor
has
a
bad
experience
with
a
picture
on
which
he
has
a
bid
and
then
which
--
which
he
has
exhibited.
the
dependent
exhibitors
got
143
adjustments
downward
from
the
defendant
distributors
aggregating
$167,000
or
about
$25,000
per
theatre.
how
many
did
viking
get
it?
he
got
two,
aggregating
$1930.
now,
let's
look
at
the
--
the
vital
statistics
here,
the
one
that
made
viking
nonvital.
the
record
shows
that
viking
paid
52%
of
its
gross
box
office
for
film
rental.
why?
because
every
time
that
went
into
the
market,
it
had
to
compete,
whereas
the
other
parties
to
this
suit
didn't
have
to
compete
when
they
went
into
the
market.
they
had
periods
of
tranquility
with
respect
to
competition,
whereas
viking
paid
52%
of
its
box
office
for
film
rental.
the
average
of
all
the
other
to
theatres
involved
in
this
suit
was
40%.
again,
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
in
dollars,
the
record
shows
that
viking's
net
after
film
rental
was
$391,000
lower
than
the
average
of
all
the
other
theatres
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
the
record
shows
that
this,
the
viking
and
the
midtown
were
really
exactly
comparable
theatres.
their
seating
capacities
were
about
the
same,
they
were
in
about
the
--
they're
in
the
same
neighborhood
and
they
--
whereas
the
midtown
had
1230
--
had
1100
seats,
viking
had
1017,
i
believe.
now,
what
happened?
goldman
made
the
argument
that
you're
suggesting,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
said
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
said
he
made
the
argument
your
question
suggests.
he
said,
"we
are
more
experienced.
we
had
better
selection
of
pictures,
and
therefore,
we
--
we
could
do
better
but
the
record
belies
it
because
their
gross
in
these
two
almost
identical
houses
was
almost
identical,
a
million
two.
but
what
made
the
difference
was
the
fact
that
the
film
rental
that
viking
paid
was
52%
whereas
the
film
rental
that
they
paid
on
the
midtown
was
only
42%,
the
film
rental
paid
on
the
goldman
was
33%
and
on
the
stanley
was
33%
and
these
are
the
figures
which
brought
the
viking
to
the
brink
of
economic
ruin
because
it
had
to
pay
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
i
have
it
exactly.
you'll
find
all
those
figures
on
record
--
in
the
record
volume
5
at
page
2067.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
precisely
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
viking
paid
$630,000
for
film
rental
whereas
the
stanley
paid
only
$381,000,
the
goldman,
$514,000,
the
midtown,
$521,000.
but
they're
all
there,
all
--
all
the
figures
are
there.
so,
if
the
court
please,
in
addition
to
this
fact,
the
record
shows
that
viking
had
to
play
22
pictures
that
grossed
to
$1,500,000
or
less
for
50
weeks.
the
economics
of
the
industry
of
such
that
if
you
can
get
a
bad
picture
in
and
out
in
a
week
and
you
don't
have
to
make
a
long
playing
commitment,
you
have
a
chance
to
make
some
money
on
it.
but
viking
had
to
pay
--
play
22
pictures
for
50
weeks.
it
had
to
play
nine
pictures
which
exceeded
$1,500,000
in
film
rental
for
78
weeks
during
this
period.
well,
these
reasons,
if
the
court
please,
we
respectfully
say
that
there
was
evidence
in
this
record
of
an
illegal
conspiracy
in
the
form
of
the
split
arrangement,
that
the
schwalberg
arrangement
was
an
invidious
refinement
of
the
split
arrangement,
which
the
defendants
don't
even
define
--
defend
insofar
as
its
legality
is
concerned.
they
simply
say
it
was
not
operative,
notwithstanding
the
exhibits
which
i
read
to
the
court.
we
have
shown
the
record
with
respect
to
the
economic
impact
on
viking.
the
economic
impact,
i've
just
detailed
for
you.
for
these
reasons,
we
say
to
the
court
that
there
was
evidence
in
this
record
from
which
a
jury
of
reasonable
men
might
have
concluded
a
conspiracy
violative
of
the
antirust
laws
and
might
have
concluded
injury
to
the
plaintiff
and
we
ask
for
the
opportunity
to
have
a
jury
pass
on
this
question.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
i'm
sure
they
did.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
can
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
--
they
did
show
fox
pictures.
that's
true.
and
the
record
shows,
if
the
court
please,
with
respect
to
fox,
first
of
all,
what
the
practice
was,
mr.
mocklare
testified
that
when
fox
was
filled
up
and
--
and
had
adequate
pictures,
that
twentieth
century-fox
could
offer
these
pictures
to
the
other
theatres
and
in
fact,
they
did
offer
these
pictures
to
the
other
theatres.
now,
also
mr.
goldman
said
that
there
were
occasions
on
which
he
was
able
to
get
film
from
fox
because
the
fox
theatre
was
committed
and
had
pictures.
and
viking
also
made
bids
and
did
get
fox
pictures
from
time-to-time.
i
don't
recall
the
precise
number
that
we've
got
but
i
can't
again
say
that
it
was
many
as
they.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
i
do
not,
but
we've
got
a
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
do
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
see,
the
only
competition
that
had
for
fox
pictures
on
the
bid
would
be
the
fox
theatre
that
had
only
one
theatre
competing
against
them.
and
if
the
fox
theatre
was
committed
to
play
a
picture
as
result
of
a
surplus
of
product
in
twentieth
century-fox,
it
had
a
chance
to
get
such
pictures.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
court
please,
on
at
least
three
occasions
this
--
this
afternoon
and
this
morning,
counsel
for
the
respondents
had
said
to
this
court
that
viking
was
invited
into
this
arrangement,
this
splitting
arrangement.
and
in
response
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
clark,
this
afternoon,
it
was
suggested
that
they
were
inviting
--
invited
in
some
time
midway
in
the
alleged
conspiratorial
period.
well,
i
--
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
record
on
that
because
i
think
it's
time
we
lay
this
to
rest.
first
of
all,
at
page
974
(a)
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
in
--
this
is
in
volume
3,
mr.
justice
clark.
the
question
is
asked,
do
you
recall,
mr.
nizer
asking
you
whether
brooks
or
your
rascal,
stanley-warner,
had
not
invited
you
into
some
wordage,
whatever
it
may
have
been
to
talk
about
a
split
at
this
luncheon
meeting,
do
you
recall
that?
yes,
sir.
and
when
was
that
event?
august.
august
of
what
year,
mr.
rim
(ph)?
1956.
the
same
year?
now,
prior
to
the
letter
from
your
lawyers,
which
you
state
was
about
the
middle
of
july,
were
you
ever
invited
to
join
the
split?
no
sir.
that's
at
page
975.
so
it
isn't
an
accurate
statement
to
say
that
this
record
shows
that
they
were
invited
into
the
split
at
the
inception
of
their
entry
into
the
motion
picture
business
or
midway.
they
were
invited
in
when
they
made
a
complaint
about
the
fact
that
there
was
an
illicit
arrangement
in
the
philadelphia
market.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there's
a
--
a
testimony
of
a
--
a
witness
named
minksy,
if
the
court
please,
from
paramount,
that
he
had
made
such
an
offer
to
mr.
rim
(ph)
in
1955
but
it
specifically
contradicted
and
under
the
basic
rules
applying
to
a
directed
verdict,
we're
entitled
to
the
most
favorable
inferences
from
the
record.
now,
mr.
nizer
suggested
that
judge
palmieri
and
mr.
burns
had
to
give
in
by
some
language,
their
benediction
to
this
split
arrangement.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
language
is
exactly
contrary
to
this
because
judge
palmieri
was
very
careful
to
say
as
pointed
out
at
page
33
of
mr.
nizer's
brief
that
splits
which
embraced
all
exhibitors
might
be
countenance.
and
when
judge
burns
was
using
the
language
which
mr.
nizer
quoted
in
a
testimony
before
a
congressional
committee,
he
was
talking
about
the
wichita
falls
and
the
alpine-texas
splits
which
embraced
all
the
exhibitors,
all
of
whom
were
parties.
and
when
a
letter
was
addressed
at
the
request
of
mr.
levenger,
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
department
of
justice,
asking
him
to
elucidate
on
this
approbation.
he
specially
said
and
you'll
find
this
language
at
the
very
last
page
of
our
brief
in
chief
that
he
would
not
extend
his
approbation.
he
would
not
say
anything
with
respect
to
a
split
that
included
less
that
all
of
the
exhibitors.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir,
of
course.
and
of
the
producers
who
are
coming
to
a
market
which
has
been
rigged
as
a
result
of
an
agreement
for
no
competition.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
suggestion
has
been
made
here
that
the
split
was
a
great
afterthought
that
came
about
after
new
counsel
came
into
the
case,
nothing
could
be
more
remote
from
the
fact.
the
record
shows
very
clearly
at
supplemental
appendix,
pages
2741,
2742
and
2743,
which
is
the
small
volume
that
was
added
to
the
record
in
the
--
in
the
lower
court
that
mr.
henry
sawyer,
who
tried
this
case
below,
vigorously
urged
upon
the
trial
judge,
the
illegality
of
the
split
system
in
which
rebuffed
by
the
trail
court.
the
record
shows
that
the
third
circuit
at
page
2777,
volume
10,
specifically
ruled
that
the
split
in
this
case
was
lawful.
this
is
not
a
new
concept.
this
concept
has
been
advanced
to
every
court
that
has
passed
upon
this
question,
from
the
trial
court
through
the
circuit,
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
now,
again,
we've
been
told
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
schwalberg
agreement
was
in
existence
and
that
mr.
nizer
directed
the
court's
attention
to
the
defendant's
exhibit
19
and
defendant's
exhibit
31
and
said,
see,
after
these
pictures
were
bid
upon
by
viking,
which
appeared
upon
the
goldman
side
of
the
split,
a
letter
went
out.
defendant's
19
and
defendant's
31,
inviting
viking
to
negotiate
and
viking
didn't
negotiate,
but
what
he
failed
to
tell
the
court,
was
that
these
pictures
were
awarded
precisely
according
to
the
split.
and
at
page
201
of
volume
1,
why
were
they
awarded
according
to
the
split?
because
the
testimony
is,
and
i
want
to
read
it
exactly
so
that
they're
will
be
no
mistake
as
to
what
the
record
says,
talking
about
the
desperate
hours,
the
picture
which
was
covered
by
defendant's
exhibit
19.
did
viking
bid?
we
did.
what
happened?
the
offer
was
rejected.
by
whom?
by
mr.
o'shea,
who
at
that
time
was
a
sales
manager
for
paramount.
in
what
fashion
was
it
rejected?
did
you
receive
a
notice?
i
assume,
we
received
a
notice
but
in
addition
to
that,
i
got
a
call
from
mr.
o'shea,
telling
me,
we
weren't
going
to
get
the
picture
that
he
had
promised
the
picture.
and
i
said,
well
what
happens
to
us?
what
happens
to
us?
and
he
said,
don't
worry,
your
turn
will
come.
now,
the
question
was
asked
toward
the
very
end
of
mr.
wolf's
statement,
well,
what
about
goldman?
did
goldman
know
what
the
bids
were?
plan
--
the
distributor
came
to
him
after
rejecting
all
the
bids
and
mr.
wolf
answered
quite
categorically.
no,
mr.
goldman
didn't
know.
well,
let's
see
what
the
record
says
on
that.
at
page
1716,
volume
4,
goldman
said,
he
could
figure
out
what
the
bids
were
once
they
were
rejected.
at
page
1606
and
1607,
volume
4,
mr.
minsky
of
stanley-warner,
said
in
the
negotiations,
the
distributor
would
say
what
he
wanted
for
the
picture.
mr.
mansell
of
warner
bros.
said,
the
negotiation
started
with
something
better
than
the
rejected
bids.
so
mr.
goldman
didn't
have
to
have
clairvoyance
to
figure
out
what
he
had
to
bid
in
order
to
get
the
picture
and
bar
the
viking
from
getting
a
chance
to
get
it
after
he
made
his
offer
when
they
in
the
first
instance
had
been
the
only
exhibitor
in
the
philadelphia
area,
willing
to
make
a
competitive
bid
against
the
other
distributors
for
or
other
exhibitors
for
a
picture
on
the
goldman
side
of
the
market.
these
are
the
facts,
if
the
court
please,
in
the
record
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
are
three
pages
mr.
justice
clark.
page
1716
of
volume
4,
testimony
by
goldman
himself,
page
2037
of
volume
5,
testimony
of
mr.
mansell
of
warner
brothers
and
page
1606
and
1607,
record
volume
4,
are
the
testimony
of
minsky
of
stanley-warner.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
these
reasons
we
say
to
the
court,
i
think
that
the
argument
from
the
respondents
have
dramatized
far
better
than
any
brief
that
this
was
a
case
for
a
jury,
for
argument
to
a
jury
and
the
plaintiff
should've
had
the
opportunity
to
let
a
jury
pass
upon
whether
there
was
a
conspiracy,
whether
it
was
damaging
to
them,
whether
it
was
unlawful.
thank
you,
sir.
