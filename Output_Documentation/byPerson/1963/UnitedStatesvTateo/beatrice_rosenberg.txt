ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
under
the
criminal
appeals
act
from
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
dismissing
an
indictment
for
bank
robbery
on
the
ground
that
a
trial
of
defendant
there
under
would
subject
him
to
double
jeopardy.
this
is
how
the
question
arose.
in
may
1956,
the
defendant
tateo
was
on
trial
under
a
five-count
indictment
arising
out
of
the
robbery
of
a
bank
in
port
chester,
new
york.
one
of
the
counts,
count
three,
charged
kidnapping
in
course
of
the
robbery,
an
offense
which
carried
life
imprisonment
and
could
even
have
carried
death
except
that
the
government
disclaimed
an
intention
as
to
that
penalty.
after
four
days
of
trial
in
which
the
codefendant
testified
and
implicated
the
defendant,
he
came
in
on
a
monday
morning
and
with
counsel
present
said
he
had
decided
to
plea
guilty.
now,
those
proceedings
are
in
the
record
at
pages
69,
and
on
the
surface
they
seem
perfectly
proper,
defendant
said
he
was
acting
voluntarily,
he
was
represented
by
counsel,
and
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
consent
to
a
search
having
disclosed
where
the
money,
part
of
the
money
from
the
robbery
was
hidden.
however,
some
years
later,
the
defendant
attacked
his
plea
of
guilty
by
a
motion
under
28
u.s.c.
2255.
i
should
say
that
after
the
plea
was
accepted,
the
kidnapping
count
was
dismissed
on
motion
of
the
defendant
with
consent
of
the
defendant
--
with
the
consent
of
the
government
and
the
defendant
was
vented
on
only
four
counts,
the
counts
other
than
the
kidnapping
charge,
he
was
given
twenty
two
and
a
half
years.
now
that
was
the
sentence
which
he
attacked
some
years
later
and
his
motion
under
2255
came
before
judge
weinfeld
for
hearing
in
1963.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
judge
weinfeld
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
plea
of
guilty
was
indeed
coerced
and
the
reasons
for
his
opinion
appear
in
the
record,
a
gist
of
it
is
on
page
40a.
what
had
happened
was
that
after
these
four
days
of
trial,
the
judge
in
the
lobby
room
in
the
presence
of
the
attorneys
for
the
defense
had
said,
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
this,
“if
you
finish
the
trial
and
your
clients
are
found
guilty
i
am
going
to
start
off
by
imposing
the
life
sentence
on
the
kidnapping
charge
and
then
i
am
going
to
add
consecutive
maximum
sentences
on
the
other
counts
on
which
they
are
found
guilty.
judge
weinfeld
found
that
this
has
a
coercive
effect,
particularly
coercive
in
a
sense
because
the
government's
case
was
very
strong
and
the
case
was
going
very
badly
from
the
defendant's
point
of
view.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
judge
newman.
the
government
did
not
appeal
in
that
decision
and
the
government
has
no
quarrel
with
that
decision
of
judge
weinfeld.
what
the
government
did
was
say
okay,
we'll
start
all
over
again.
and
so
they
moved
not
only
for
a
retrial
on
the
counts
to
which
the
defendant
had
pleaded
guilty,
hey
had
a
new
indictment
returned
reinstating
count
three,
the
dismissed
kidnapping
count.
it
was
to
that
count
that
the
defendant
originally
made
a
motion
to
have
it
dismissed
on
the
grounds
that
a
trail
they
are
under
would
constitute
double
jeopardy.
and
it
was
at
the
suggestion
of
the
district
judge,
judge
tyler
that
the
motion
was
broadened
to
include
both
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
kidnapping
count
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
four
counts
on
which
the
defendant
had
pleaded
guilty,
to
which
he
had
pleaded
guilty
and
on
which
he
had
received
a
sentence
of
twenty
two-and-a-half
years
concurrent.
after
considerable
argument
judge
tower
did
dismiss
both
indictments.
the
new
kidnapping
indictment
and
the
four
--
the
indictment
with
the
four
counts
to
which
the
defendant
had
pleaded
guilty.
it
was
his
view
that
the
action
of
the
trial
judge,
which
coerced
the
guilty
plea
kept
the
case
from
going
to
the
jury,
and
therefore,
under
the
mistrial
cases,
including
this
court's
recent
decision
last
year
in
downum
he
thought
retrial
was
broad.
now,
the
government
is
here
appealing
only
from
so
much
of
the
decision
as
dismissed
the
indictment
to
which
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
and
on
which
he
was
sentenced.
it
is
not
appealing
from
the
dismissal
of
the
kidnapping
indictment
and
the
reason
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
for
the
selective
appeal?
the
reason
for
selective
appeal
mr.
justice
is
what
we
regard
as
the
key
to
this
case,
and
that
is
that
on
the
counts
to
which
defendant
pleaded
guilty,
there
was
a
judgment.
the
case
had
come
to
a
conclusion,
there
was
a
judgment
finally
against
the
(inaudible),
which
would
have
run
its
course
had
the
defendant
not
moved
to
set
it
aside
and
it
is
our
view
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
lower
courts
practically
from
the
(inaudible)
of
this
government
are
to
be
a
sect
that
one
who
moves
to
have
a
judgment
set
aside,
re-subject
himself
to
the
jeopardy
represented
by
that
judgment.
in
our
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
your
honor
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
rule
as
to
appeal,
that
one
who
moves
to
set
aside
re-subjects
himself
to
the
jeopardy
represented
by
that
judgment
which
was
first
announced
by
this
court
in
the
ball
case
as
to
appeals
in
criminal
cases
were
authorized,
but
the
question
came
out
in
the
early
history
of
this
republic
on
motions
for
a
new
trial
and
with
the
one
exception
of
the
opinion
by
justice
storey
in
united
states
against
gilbert
which
has
not
been
followed.
the
whole
trend
of
judicial
decision
in
this
country
has
been
that
there
is
power
to
grant
a
new
trial
and
this
means
in
a
sense
when
you
set
aside,
to
grant
a
new
trial
you
set
aside
the
judgment
and
that
is
start
over
again
on
the
matters
represented
by
the
judgment,
and
i
don't
read
the
mistrial
cases
as
been
contrary
to
that,
because
in
the
mistrial
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
kidnapping
count
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
the
one
we
are
not
appealing
from
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
because
that
does
not
go
to
judgment.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
in
view
--
the
trial
judge's
view
which
i
think
we
agree
with,
that
you
cannot
simply
separate
the
kidnapping
count
from
the
whole
picture,
that
as
to
the
kidnapping
count,
it
is
true,
it
was
dismissed
on
the
motion
of
the
judge
--
of
the
defendant,
but
it
was
part
of
a
guilty
plea.
this
was
obviously
understood
by
all
parties
that
when
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
the
trial
would
not
proceed
under
the
kidnapping
count
and
it
never
did
we
felt
in
the
judgment
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
but
i
think,
i
think
it
cannot,
because
it's
viewed
as
that
it
must
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
understood
that
the
kidnapping
count
would
be
dismissed
i
think
this
is
the
clear
reading
of
that
record.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
it's
such
a
technical
--
a
judgment
is
not
a
technical
thing
a
judgment
is
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
they
were
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
it
was
not
attacked
by
the
defendant.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
kidnapping
count
involved
problems
under
this
court's
(inaudible)
because
while
it
is
true
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
that's
our
position.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
that's
the
major
one.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
but
i
think
it
is
true
that
the
major
reasons
for
not
taking
up,
the
kidnapping
count
is
that
we
think
the
significant
fact
that
distinguishes
in
this
trial
case
is,
is
the
fact
that
this
case
went
to
judgment.
as
we
read
in
this
trial
cases,
what
they
say
is
if
a
defendant
is
unnecessarily
kept
from
getting
a
judgment,
the
judgment
will
be
for
this
purpose
taken
as
a
judgment
for
the
defendant,
so
he
can't
be
tried
again.
and
it's
interesting
that
in
the
united
states
against
green,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief,
one
of
very
early
cases
setting
out
the
right
to
demand
a
new
trial
this
is
exactly
the
distinction
that
he
made,
the
distinction
between
the
mistrial
cases
which
had
already
known
to
exist
and
the
case
which
had
gone
to
judgment
and
the
fact
is
that
there
was
a
judgment
that
it
was
binding
until
it
will
set
aside.
now
my
opponent
says
that
that
rule
which
he
recognizes
and
which
this
court
reaffirmed
in
green
and
in
foreman
very
recently,
he
says
that
doesn't
apply
here
because
although
the
case
went
to
judgment,
it
didn't
go
to
verdict
and
he
argues
that
there
is
something
that
a
case
ought
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
verdict.
but
that's
a
distinction
that
doesn't
make
any
logical
sense
in
relation
to
the
judgment
rule,
because
a
plea
of
guilty
has
always
been
deemed
the
equivalent
of
a
verdict,
a
plea
of
guilty
supports
a
judgment
just
the
same
way
as
a
verdict
supports
the
judgment,
it's
the
judgment,
at
the
end
of
the
litigation.
and
whatever
the
trial
judge
did
or
didn't
do
wrong
in
this
case,
he
didn't
--
these
cases
from
going
to
these
counsel,
going
to
judgment
so
that
we
do
end
up
with
a
judgment.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
sense
to
say,
that
if
a
defendant
has
gone
through
a
whole
trial
and
get
his
case
reversed
on
appeal,
he
can
be
retried,
but
this
defendant
has
only
gone
through
part
of
a
trial
and
had
plead
guilty
cannot
be
retried
even
though
both
cases
have
gone
to
judgment.
there
are
all
sorts
of
errors,
a
hanging,
(inaudible)
is
called
or
an
instruction
to
this
regard
the
defendants
evident,
an
instruction
on
the
wrong
theory
of
the
case,
these
are
all
the
errors
which
have
caused
reversal
on
appeal,
but
which
have
never
been
deemed
for
a
retrial
and
they
are
every
bit
as
coercive
or
passively
more
coercive
than
what
was
done
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
now
my
opponent
says,
oh
well,
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
one
slim
chance
that
the
jury
will
have
quit
in
the
phase
that
everything
the
judge
says,
in
the
face
of
these
wrong
instructions
and
everything
else,
but
if
a
distinction
has
to
be
drawn
on
that
one
slim
chance
seems
to
me
a
lot
of
our
appellate
lawyers
become
a
matter
of
gains
and
i
don't
believe
it.
i
don't
think
anybody
doubts
that
the
so
called
hanging
charge
doesn't
leave
much
of
a
slim
chance.
and
furthermore
if
the
slim
chance
is
going
to
be
the
distinction,
it
doesn't
make
sense
in
this
case
because
here
the
defendant
got
much
more
of
a
benefit
than
a
slim
chance,
he
got
the
certainty,
understanding
in
the
virtual
certainty
that
the
kidnapping
count
was
going
to
be
dismissed,
which
is
certainly
more
significant
than
this
one
slim
chance
of
acquittal
in
the
face
of
grievous
error
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge.
i
think
the
real
question
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
he
said
that's
right.
that's
another
answer,
but
there
is
this
mystique
i
should
say
of
having
--
the
facts
of
the
case
have
gone
to
the
jury,
that
it's
supposed
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
others
and
this
is
one
of
the
distinctions
that's
offered
and
i
don't
find
it's
a
very
satisfactory
distinction
because
i
don't
think
it's
meaningful.
i
think
the
real
question
here
is
why
this
rule
which
has
been,
as
i
say,
the
american
system
from
the
beginning
even
if
the
framers
of
the
constitution
obviously
thought
that
a
rule
allowing
a
new
trial
after
judgment
had
been
set
aside
with
a
benefit
and
it
is
different
from
the
english
rules.
so
the
question
is
what
is
the
real
rational
of
that
opinion?
curiously
for
a
doctrine
that
has
been
in
our
law
from
the
beginning
there
is
almost
no
philosophy
in
the
decisions.
the
ball
case
talked
about
waiver
and
it
didn't
--
and
so
did
the
earlier
cases.
it
apparently
reflects
the
view
that
this
was
something
of
benefit
to
the
discernment,
the
right
to
have
a
new
trial,
but
this
court
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
in
green
indicated
the
doctrine
of
waiver
was
more
of
a
statement
of
a
result
than
a
realistic
appraisal
of
what
occurred.
what
the
defendant
wants
to
do
is
go
free.
if
he
can't
go
free
he'll
take
a
new
trial
to
get
the
judgment
but
it
isn't
waiver
in
the
sense
that
that's
normally
used
and
so
i
think
we
do
have
to
consider
what
is
the
philosophy
under
law
in
this
rule
which
has
been
ours
from
the
beginning
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
important
--
that
doesn't
here
in
the
very
term
judgment.
judgment
is
the
ultimate
end
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
this
is
how
a
system
of
law
operates.
you
can't
treat
it
lightly.
it
can't
be
wiped
out
of
the
books
easily
and
so
faced
with
the
significance
of
judgment,
there
were
really
two
routes.
one
is
the
english
route,
which
gives
the
appellate
court
a
great
deal
of
power
to
effect
the
sentence,
but
which
does
set
aside
a
judgment
completely
only
for
very
grievous
error,
and
which
--
one
that
is
done
--
does
decree
that
there
cannot
be
a
new
trail
in
criminal
cases.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
it's
really
more
than
that.
we
haven't
timed
to
intuit
the
whole
english
system
in
a
sense
discourages
appeals.
i
should
say
in
general
that
the
english
seem
to
me
to
give
much
more
weight
to
the
unreviewable
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
than
we
do,
but
if
a
judgment
is
going
to
result
in
a
defendant
going
free,
if
the
reverse
of
a
judgment
is
going
to
result
in
the
defendant
going
free,
it
seems
to
me
inevitable
that
any
closed
case
is
going
to
be
decided
against
the
defendant.
and
it
seems
to
me
inevitable
that
consciously
or
unconsciously
a
feeling
of
that
guilt
or
innocence
is
going
to
affect
the
result.
and
so
if
we
are
going
to
have
our
system
which
wants
to
keep
its
judgment
as
free
from
error
as
possible,
if
we
have
a
system
of
appeals
where
we
have
reversal
not
only
because
an
error
might
have
influenced
the
verdict,
but
even
for
errors
in
procedure
like
assembling
a
grand
jury,
that
don't
even
go
to
the
fairness
of
a
particular
trial.
if
this
holds
supervisory
power
of
appellant
reviews
is
to
be
kept,
it
almost
inevitably
follows
that
a
--
when
you
set
aside
a
judgment
for
that
kind
of
error
which
does
not
necessarily
go
to
guilt
or
innocence,
if
the
system
is
to
work
there
might
be
a
way
where
the
issues
can
be
retried,
the
issues
represented
by
the
judgment
independently
of
the
error.
with
the
development
of
2255
it
seems
to
me
the
same
considerations
that
apply
on
appeal
apply
in
this
situation.
i
think
the
principle
goes
beyond
this
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
this
case
illustrates
the
principle.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
there
are
actually
seven
years
before
it
was
set
down.
he
did
start
his
motion
a
couple
years
before
that
and
they
were
originally
none
of
facts
alleged
so
that
it
wasn't
a
hearing,
he
started
his
motion
1961,
it
was
heard
in
1963,
but
of
course
the
principles
of
saying
whether
it's
seven
weeks.
it
may
happen
to
be
seven
years
in
this
case,
but
if
this
rule
of
law
announced
by
the
district
court
is
correct,
then
if
this
happens
everyday,
there
is
seven
weeks
you
would
still
not
be
able
to
retry
the
defendant.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
the
principal
is
more
important
than
the
particular
aspect
this
defendant
has
served
some
time.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
it
was
originally
denied
because
--
and
then
it
started
to
go
up
on
appeal
and
at
that
point
the
defendant
got
counsel
and
came
in
with
new
evidence
so
that
the
original
allegation,
i
don't
think
it
was
two
years,
i
think
its
about
a
year-and-a-half,
from
1961
to
1963,
but
i
think
it's
about
a
year-and-a-half,
but
his
original
allegations
did
not
have
what
turn
out
to
be
the
crucial
aspect,
which
was
the
judge's
remarks
to
counsel
in
the
chambers.
and
of
course
this
is
not
--
this
is
a
situation
in
which
if
he
is
convicted
on
retrial,
the
judge
will
have
complete
discretion
on
sentencing.
so
that
he
could
allow
for
credit,
for
the
time
spent
in
jail.
i
think
this
case
is
really
just
that.
the
question
is,
are
we
going
to
adhere
to
the
policy
that
has
been
the
policy
of
this
country
since
the
early
years
of
the
republic
and
never
to
my
knowledge
not
both,
which
is
that
at
least
as
to
the
counts
represented
by
the
judgment.
the
setting
aside
of
a
judgment
starts
the
case
back
on
its
course
and
there
is
an
opportunity
to
re-litigate
the
issues.
and
i
think
it's
important
that
this
be
kept
because
in
the
long
run,
one
doesn't
know
what
this
decision
would
have
been
if
we
had
the
english
rule.
there
judge
tyler
in
effect
himself
said
he
didn't
know
how
judge
weinfeld
would
have
acted
if
judge
weinfeld
thought
that
by
granting
the
motion
under
2255,
he
was
allowing
the
defendant
to
go
free.
it
is
--
the
possibility
of
a
life
sentence
was
always
in
this
case
as
long
as
the
kidnapping
was
there.
and
while
everybody
seems
to
have
thought
that
adding
a
consecutive
sentence
made
a
difference
i
do
not
know,
because
it
did.
the
statute
had
been
amended
in
1951,
so
that
any
sentence
more
than
45
years
of
time
for
parole
is
15
years,
and
apparently
nobody
at
the
time
was
aware
of
that,
but
this
is
not
important
in
and
off
itself.
the
significant
thing
is
that
whenever
you
have
a
close
case
and
there
obviously
can
be
closer
cases
than
this,
it's
going
to
be
difficult
for
a
judge
to
decide
the
case
before
him
if
he
knows
that
a
decision
setting
aside
the
plea
is
going
to
going
to
result
in
the
defendants
going
free.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
they
do.
well
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion
in
the
record
about
that.
the
judge
indicated
he
knew
that
as
to
so
those.
he
had
to
give
concurrent
sentences.
he
said
as
to
a
codefendant,
i
would
have
given
you
55
years,
but
the
codefendant
had
two
bank
robberies
involved,
so
that
was
different,
but
in
that
case
on
page
25
he
said,
the
attorney
said
i'm
sure
your
honor
is
familiar
with
the
decisions
as
the
other
counts
can
be
consecutive.
now
of
course
it
was
thought
at
the
time
that
the
kidnapping
count
could
be
separate.
it
was
only
made
that
the
decisions
tend
to
indicate
that,
that
would
not
be
so
and
it's
not
an
absolutely
fixed
question
now.
but
be
as
it
may
one
of
surprising
things
about
this
whole
thing
is
that
the
judge,
the
attorney
and
i
think
judge
weinfeld,
when
he
got
again
(inaudible),
the
consecutive
sentences
to
a
life
sentence
added
something
and
they
don't
under
the
statute
which
is
18
u.s.c
4202,
the
defendant
would
have
be
eligible
for
parole
at
any
time.
i
suppose
the
kidnapping,
conviction
would
have
made
things
good
for
parole,
but
the
additional
sentence
wouldn't
have
affected
the
judgment
at
all.
so
i
say
the
principle
is
much
more
important
however
than
this
case
–-
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right,
that
this
case
had
gone
to
judgment
and
that
it
is
our
rule
and
now
we
passed
in
the
rule
and
the
passing
of
the
rule
is
very
important,
because
this
is
what
enabled
the
court
to
decide
either
appeal
or
2255
on
the
basis
of
the
case
without
being
too
concerned
about
possible
guilt
or
innocence
because
that
question
can
be
re-determined
in
a
trial
free
from
error.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
have
a
judgment
and
a
judgment
is
something
which
has
to
be
taken
seriously
by
a
court
of
law.
