mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
the
beneficial
ownership
of
the
united
states
savings
bonds
when
there
is
encountered
a
conflict
between
the
survivorship
provisions
of
those
bonds
and
the
community
property
law,
in
this
case
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
case
was
heard
in
the
trial
court
on
stipulated
facts
which
essentially
are
these.
angel
and
pearle
yiatchos
were
married
in
washington
in
1943
and
resided
there
as
man
and
wife
until
the
death
of
angel
in
1958.
in
1950
and
1951,
angel
yiatchos,
the
husband,
purchased
the
united
states
series
e
savings
bonds
in
question
with
community
property.
he
named
on
each
of
these
bonds
as
the
pod
or
the
pay-on-death
beneficiary,
his
brother
gust
yiatchos.
at
the
time
of
his
death,
mr.
yiatchos
left
the
will
in
which
he
bequeathed
all
of
his
bonds
to
six
relatives
including
one
--
among
one
of
the
six,
his
brother
gust
who
is
also
the
petitioner
here.
the
bonds
were
of
the
total
value
of
approximately
$15,000
out
of
an
entire
community
estate
of
approximately
$36,500,
and
it
is
stipulated
that
the
bonds
are
not
required
for
the
payment
of
creditors'
claims.
there
are
three
claimants
to
the
bonds,
the
petitioner
gust
yiatchos
who
is
the
beneficiary
named
on
the
bonds,
the
--
the
widow
pearle
yiatchos
and
the
legatees
under
the
last
will
and
testament
of
gust
yiatchos.
the
contentions
of
the
parties
are
best
illustrated
by
considering
the
three
possible
results
which
were
available
to
the
court
in
resolving
the
case.
if
the
survivorship
provisions
of
the
bonds
were
followed,
the
bonds
would
be
awarded
to
gust
yiatchos
in
their
entirety.
if
that
should
be
construed
to
be
a
fraud
on
the
widow,
one
half
of
the
bonds
could
have
been
reserved
or
the
equivalent
in
value
could
have
been
reserved
to
the
widow
by
way
of
a
trust.
if
the
purchasing
of
the
bonds
and
the
designate
--
designation
of
the
brother
as
beneficiary
were
held
to
be
a
complete
fraud
and
void
in
its
entirety,
the
widow
would
then
receive
her
half
interest
in
the
bonds
and
the
legatees
under
the
will
would
take
by
a
way
of
the
will
the
remaining
half
interest.
the
trial
court
held
that
under
the
stipulated
facts,
this
was
in
effect
an
attempted
gift
of
community
property
and
therefore,
it
was
void
in
its
entirety
and
the
beneficiary
designated
on
the
bonds
took
nothing.
the
widow
--
the
bonds
were
held
in
trust
for
the
estate
which
would
give
the
widow
her
half
interest
and
the
other
half
interest
would
be
distributed
to
the
legatees
named
under
the
will.
the
case
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
and
after
it
had
been
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
on
written
briefs
and
on
oral
argument
but
prior
to
the
decision
of
the
state
court,
this
court
decided
the
case
of
free
versus
bland
which
also
involved
the
question
of
beneficial
ownership
of
u.s.
savings
bonds
in
a
community
property
law
state,
it
having
a
reason
out
of
texas
and
the
question
there
presented
to
the
court
was
whether
the
treasury
regulations
governing
survivorship,
determined
the
beneficial
ownership
of
the
bonds
or
whether
they
were
merely
for
the
convenience
of
the
government
in
making
payment,
with
the
government
having
no
interest
in
who
ultimately
receive
the
proceeds.
the
court
held
in
free
versus
bland
that
the
survivorship
provisions
and
the
treasury
regulations
were
a
substantial
feature
of
the
bonds
and
intended
to
and
which
did
make
the
bonds
attractive
to
investors
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
provided
a
very
simple
and
efficient
and
quick
way
to
transmit
property
on
death
and
thus
avoiding
the
--
and
thus
to
avoid
the
complications
and
the
delay
and
the
expensive
probate
proceedings,
that
these
features
contributed
substantially
to
the
marketability
of
the
bonds
and
consequently
to
the
management
of
the
national
death
by
the
u.s.
treasury
department
under
the
constitutional
authority
to
borrow
money
on
the
credit
of
united
states.
the
court
pointed
out
that
under
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution,
the
relative
importance
to
estate
of
its
own
state
law
is
not
material
if
it
is
in
conflict
with
a
valid
federal
law
and
stated
this
holding
in
this
language.
"we
hold,
therefore,
that
the
state
law
which
prohibits
a
married
couple
from
taking
advantage
of
the
survivorship
provisions
of
united
states
savings
bonds
merely
because
the
purchased
price
is
paid
out
of
community
property
must
fall
under
the
supremacy
clause.”
the
court
also
indicated
that
there
was
an
exception
implicit
in
the
bonds
in
the
treasury
regulations
so
that
the
bonds
could
not
become
a
sanctuary
for
fraud
and
that
relief
would
be
available
under
circumstances
where
fraud
was
--
or
breach
of
trust
was
manifest.
the
court
indicated
that
the
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
the
free
versus
bland
case?
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes,
i
understand
that
the
supreme
court
of
texas
determined
that
there
were
no
allegations
of
fraud
and
therefore
the
decision
in
the
u.s.
supreme
court
was
dispositive
of
the
case
and
entered
judgment
accordingly.
the
court
also
indicated
that
the
doctrine
of
fraud
which
would
be
applicable
in
this
situation
was
the
doctrine
of
fraud
under
federal
law
and
cited
in
the
footnotes,
the
cases
of
clearfield
trust
company
versus
united
states
and
holmberg
versus
armbrecht.
following
this
decision,
the
washington
supreme
court
which
had
the
case
pending
before
it,
decided
in
the
instant
case
that
the
purchase
of
the
bonds
by
the
husband
designating
the
brother
as
beneficiary
was
an
attempt
to
convert
community
property
into
separate
property
and
therefore,
it
was
an
effect
a
fraud
on
the
wife
and
the
purchase
with
the
designation
of
the
beneficiary
was
void
ab
initio
and
affirmed
the
trial
court
in
its
judgment
that
the
named
beneficiary
on
the
bonds
took
nothing
and
that
the
bonds
reverted
to
the
estate
with
half
to
go
to
the
wife
and
the
other
half
ultimately
to
go
to
the
legatees.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
there
is
no
statement
and
no
--
no
fact
as
to
whether
there
was
consent
or
not
and
the
court
merely
held
in
effect
and
it
was
a
very
brief
opinion
that
in
the
absence
of
proof
of
consent
that
the
mere
purchase
itself
would
constitute
the
constructive
fraud
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
effect
of
this
decision
of
the
washington
supreme
court
is
that
a
married
person
does
not
have
the
right
to
take
advantage
of
the
survivorship
provisions
of
united
states
saving
bonds
when
they're
purchased
with
community
property,
which
we
argue
is
flatly
contrary
to
the
specific
holding
in
free
versus
bland.
the
court
purported
to
bring
the
case
within
the
exception
stated
in
free
versus
bland
but
in
its
effort
to
do
so,
i
would
suggest
that
it
had
the
exceptions
swallow
the
holding
and
that
the
decision
can
be
construed
in
no
other
way
than
that
community
property
law
transcends
the
treasury
regulations
pertaining
to
these
survivorship
provisions.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
fraud,
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
no
actual
fraud
contended
for
in
the
case,
there
were
no
allegations
of
actual
fraud
and
there
are
no
facts
found
upon
which
actual
fraud
could
be
said
to
exist.
the
only
way
that
fraud
can
be
considered
to
be
present
in
this
case
is
simply
by
holding
as
a
matter
of
law
that
a
member
of
the
community
cannot
purchase
u.s.
savings
bonds
designating
anyone
other
than
his
spouse
as
beneficiary
or
presumably
co-owner
if
it
were
that
type
of
bonds.
in
that
regard,
i
would
point
out
in
the
first
place
that
the
husband
is
the
manager
of
the
community
property
and
as
such,
he
has
the
right
to
handle
the
investments
and
to
select
the
investments
and
this
is
regardless
of
either
the
knowledge
or
consent
or
even
the
objection
of
the
wife.
it
had
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
he
does
not
have
the
right
to
make
substantial
gifts
to
other
people
without
the
wife's
consent.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
i
think
that
the
purchase
of
the
u.s.
savings
bonds
in
this
situation
involves
both
aspects.
in
the
first
place,
they
are
bought
by
a
living
person
with
the
contemplation
of
continuing
to
live
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
and
in
this
case,
he
did
and
in
that
sense
during
the
continuance
of
his
life
and
of
the
marriage,
these
represent
a
security
and
consequently
an
investment
of
the
community
and
assets
of
the
community.
at
the
same
time,
either
party
to
the
community
has
the
right
to
dispose
of
half
--
not
more
than
half
of
the
community
property
by
will
and
this
in
effect
an
alternative
to
a
will
by
--
by
way
of
making
disposition
of
property
on
death.
so
the
u.s.
savings
bonds
in
this
case
are
--
are
in
the
first
instance,
an
investment
which
the
husband
is
authorized
to
make
as
manager
of
the
community
property
and
in
the
second
place,
they
are
a
technique
or
a
device
whereby
he
may
transmit
his
share
of
the
community
property
on
death.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
in
the
facts
of
free
versus
bland,
the
husband
and
wife
purchased
--
well,
i
don't
know
who
purchased
the
bonds
but
in
any
event,
they
were
purchased
in
the
name
of
the
husband
and
the
wife
as
co-owners.
thereafter,
the
wife
died
and
the
husband
claimed
ownership
of
the
bonds
in
their
entirety
and
an
heir
of
the
wife
claims
that
they
should
have
remained
part
of
her
estate
so
that
he
could
have
inherited
them.
in
this
case,
the
bonds
were
made
payable
to
the
brother
as
beneficiary
and
it
is
the
wife
who
is
claiming
the
bonds.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes,
i
am
very
definite.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
but
in
any
event,
yeah,
that
is
correct.
our
--
our
position
is
that
--
that
the
proper
rule
and
that
in
seeking
a
uniform
rule
as
the
--
as
the
court
has
indicated
should
be
sought
under
federal
law
and
citing
the
--
the
clearfield
trust
company
case
that
this
should
not
be
left
to
state
court
decision
but
that
the
decision
should
here
be
made
by
this
court
in
this
case
and
i
will
refer
to
that
later
and
that
a
proper
test
in
order
to
obtain
a
rule
of
uniformity
rather
than
to
leave
it
to
the
various
decisions
of
the
various
state
courts
would
be
first
to
say
that
either
there
must
be
actual
fraud
or
that
there
must
be
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
offending
spouse,
if
that
is
the
proper
term,
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
spouse
by
this
device
to
dispose
of
more
property
than
it
could
have
by
will.
and
so
long
as
he
does
not
exceed
that,
it's
our
contention
that
there
is
no
fraud
because
here,
the
husband
could
have
disposed
of
half
of
the
community
estate
amounting
to
in
excess
of
$36,000
by
will.
by
the
device
of
community
--
of
u.s.
savings
bonds,
he
has
in
effect
attempted
to
dispose
of
less
than
that
and
therefore,
it's
our
contention
that
this
cannot
be
said
to
be
a
fraud.
the
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
frankly,
it
would
be
my
belief
and
opinion
that
it
would
be
because
the
husband
has
the
right.
he
has
the
right
to
select
investments
regardless
of
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
the
wife
and
he
has
the
absolute
right
to
leave
half
of
his
property
by
will
and
there's
never
been
any
suggestion
that
he
has
to
obtain
the
consent
or
approval
of
the
wife
in
order
to
dispose
of
his
property
by
will.
therefore,
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
not
be
free
to
dispose
of
it
by
this
method
regardless
of
the
consent
of
the
wife.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
i
would
certainly
agree
that
he
would
be
free
to
devote
--
to
invest
the
entire
community
estate
in
community
--
in
u.s.
savings
bonds.
however,
if
he
attempted
to
dispose
of
a
greater
portion
of
the
community
property
by
this
technique
then
he
could
have
disposed
off
by
will
then
i
think
that
you
would
become
involved
with
a
--
with
a
question
of
a
fraud
on
the
wife
because
she
is
entitled
to
her
half
of
the
community
property.
where
it
amounts
to
less
than
that,
it's
our
position
that
there
can
be
considered
to
be
no
fraud
and
that
the
status
which
the
washington
supreme
court
has
left
us
in
is
that
a
--
a
husband
has
the
right
to
dispose
off
half
of
his
property
by
will,
but
that
he
can
dispose
of
it
only
by
will
and
that
he
can't
utilize
u.s.
savings
bonds.
and
in
fact
under
the
present
situation
of
the
law
in
washington,
an
investment
--
or
the
use
of
u.s.
savings
bonds
is
something
which
a
married
person
should
very
carefully
avoid
because
if
he
attempts
to
make
a
disposition
by
way
of
u.s.
savings
bonds,
he
has
depleted
his
estate
by
the
amount
which
he
has
invested
in
the
bonds
and
that
attempted
disposition
is
held
entirely
void
and
so
he
has
whatever
might
be
left
to
dispose
of
by
will
which
is
less
than
he
could
have
if
he
had
not
bought
u.s.
savings
bonds
at
all.
so
if
this
state
of
the
law
is
permitted
to
continue,
the
attractiveness
of
u.s.
savings
bonds
to
people
certainly
in
the
state
of
washington
and
potentially
in
other
community
property
estates
--
property
estates
has
been
very
seriously
diminished
and
damaged.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
these
are
pay-on-death
bonds.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes
and
there
is
no
reason
at
all
why
at
any
time
prior
to
the
death
of
the
named
owner
that
the
bonds
would
not
be
available
for
any
legitimate
community
purpose.
they
are
subject
to
attachment
by
judgment
creditors
of
the
community.
they
certainly
would
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
a
divorce
action
in
the
division
of
property
and
simply
constitute
a
perfectly
valid
and
legitimate
holding
of
the
community
so
long
as
the
community
exists.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
no.
i
am
saying
that
by
will,
he
could
dispose
of
one
half
of
the
entire
estate.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
so
long
as
he
does
not
exceed
that,
he
has
committed
no
fraud
on
his
wife.
and
if
he
wanted
to
--
if
he
--
if
a
man
had
an
estate
of
$50,000
and
he
wanted
to
dispose
of
$25,000
of
it
by
will
and
leave
–
the
wife
having
the
other
$25,000,
this
is
perfectly
valid
if
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
i
would
agree.
in
fact
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
his
bonds
represented
more
than
half
of
the
community
estate
that
then
he
--
to
that
extent,
he
would
be
encroaching
upon
the
wife's
half.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
if
he
endeavored
to
dispose
of
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
--
of
more
than
half
of
his
estate
which
would
be
more
--
which
would
then
be
encroaching
upon
his
wife's
half
of
the
estate,
i
think
that
i
--
i
would
recognize
that
there
would
be
a
fair
contention
for
fraud
on
behalf
of
the
wife.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
so.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
relationship
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
oh,
by
value?
yes,
there's
$15,000
with
the
bonds
out
of
the
total
estate
of
$36,505.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
record
your
honor.
he
--
he
left
a
substantial
bequeaths
to
his
wife
and
disposed
of
all
cash
and
bonds
of
which
a
diocesan
for
just
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
it
does
not
show
in
the
record.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
i
--
i
would
think
it
would
be
proper
to
consider
as
of
the
time
of
death
because
that
is
the
estate
existing
at
the
time
of
death
in
which
the
wife
is
entitled
to
share
her
half.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes,
yes.
yes.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
if
it
invaded
the
wife's
half
of
the
estate,
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
a
--
a
reasonable
case
for
constructive
fraud
upon
the
wife,
but
not
until
that
time.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
in
response
to
that
and
--
and
it
is
a
--
a
question
that
i
wanted
to
make
some
point
of
generally,
it's
our
position
that
under
the
federal
law
of
fraud
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
person
asserting
the
fraud
to
allege
it
and
prove
it.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
well
that's
true.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
free
versus
bland.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
no.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
no,
it
was
decided
afterwards.
however,
i
think
and
i
would
suggest
the
law
of
fraud
is
--
has
been
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
under
the
facts
of
the
present
case,
i
would
say
that
since
it
does
not
appear
that
there
is
here
an
attempt
to
dispose
of
more
than
half
of
the
community
estate
by
will,
or
by
the
use
of
the
--
these
bonds
which
we're
here
concerned
with
that
therefore,
there
is
presently
before
us
no
fraud.
now,
if
upon
the
final
settlement
of
the
case,
it
should
appear
that
--
and
i
think
that
that
should
be
determined
--
determinative
of
the
case
at
this
point
because
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
as
to
the
bonds.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
because
there
are
no
allegations
of
fraud
and
there
are
no
facts
here
from
which
fraud
can
be
recognized.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
the
difference
between
free
versus
bland
in
this
case
is
that
that
was
before
the
court
on
a
decision
on
a
summary
judgment
in
which
there
were
allegations
of
fact
which
had
not
yet
been
tried
and
were
not
before
the
court
on
the
summary
judgment,
but
in
this
case
it's
here
on
--
on
stipulated
facts
and
there
are
no
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
oh
yes.
yes.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
this
is
correct.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
there
was
no
gift
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
no,
this
is
what
has
been
referred
to
in
a
--
commented
to
as
i
would
call
it
a
will
substitute
or
an
alternative
to
a
testamentary
disposition.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
in
that
--
in
that
regard,
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
also
to
a
later
statute
of
washington
which
is
rcw
11.4.240
which
says
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
it's
on
page
5
of
the
brief
for
petitioner.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
if
the
registered
owner
of
u.s.
savings
bonds
dies
leaving
a
--
a
beneficiary
named
on
the
bonds,
the
beneficiary
will
be
the
sole
and
absolutely
owner
of
the
bonds
and
our
state
court
simply
held
that
this
section
doesn't
apply
to
community
property
but
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes,
but
i
would
seriously
dispute
the
position
of
the
court
that
that
section
should
not
apply
to
community
property.
however,
regardless
of
--
of
the
matter
of
testamentary
disposition,
i
think
that
we
here
under
the
supremacy
clause
if
the
state
statute
is
construed
to
hold
that
disposition
of
property
on
death
can
be
made
only
by
testamentary
disposition,
we
have
in
effect
nullified
the
survivorship
provisions
of
u.s.
savings
bonds
and
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
--
and
free
against
bland
and
the
supremacy
of
the
treasury
regulations.
they
would
all
--
they
would
all
vanish
if
that
state
statute
were
permitted
to
prevail.
so
our
position
then
--
in
summary
is
that
there
was
no
fraud
here,
no
actual
fraud
and
no
constructive
fraud
and
that
if
it
be
considered
in
line
with
the
questions
that
were
asked
that
as
a
result
of
the
combination
of
the
will
in
the
u.s.
savings
bonds
that
there
might
--
thereby
be
worth
of
potential
fraud
on
the
wife,
but
that
adjustment
should
be
made
under
the
will
and
not
under
the
u.s.
savings
bonds
because
until
the
u.s.
savings
bonds
as
instrumentalities
in
themselves
constitute
a
fraud,
they
should
be
upheld
under
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
correct.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
that
--
that
is
our
contention
and
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
supremacy
clause
in
the
enforcement
of
the
treasury
regulations.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
i
--
i
think
--
i
--
i
view
it
as
the
same
question.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
no,
because
the
use
of
the
bonds
would
not
constitute
the
fraud.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes,
only
beyond
the
50%.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
i
--
i
would
think
that
the
interest
of
the
beneficiary
is
under
the
will.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
his
question.
i
believe
my
time
is
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
if
these
bonds
with
the
entire
estate,
the
wife
would
be
entitled
the
half
of
them.
if
there
were
a
will
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
the
--
the
facts
in
the
record
are
that
that
the
entire
estate
is
$36,000
and
the
bonds
are
$15,000.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
that's
in
the
record.
that's
in
the
stipulated
facts.
so
half
of
that
would
be
$18,000
and
this
is
less
than
that
so
the
bonds
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
$36,000
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
that's
including
the
bonds.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
that's
correct.
this,
therefore,
amounts
to
less
than
half
of
the
entire
estate.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
it's
--
it's
simply
stipulated
that
the
proceeds
of
the
bonds
are
not
needed
for
payment
of
community
debts.
that
--
that's
in
the
stipulated
facts.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
well,
it
is
not.
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
my
--
my
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
this
is
a
possibility
and
--
and
that
would
be
a
necessity
in
order
to
constitute
the
fraud.
it's
the
burden
on
the
party
alleging
the
fraud
to
establish
the
fraud
and
they
have
not
done
so
and
under
the
facts
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
it
doesn't
appear
that
they
are
and
it
should
have
been
made
--
mr.
ernest
r.
whitmore,
jr.
--
and
it
should
have
been
made
to
appear
so
by
the
party
having
the
burden
of
proof.
thank
you.
