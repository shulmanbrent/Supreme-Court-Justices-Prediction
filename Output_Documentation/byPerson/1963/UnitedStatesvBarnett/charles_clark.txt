mr.
charles
clark
may
it
please
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
and
honorable
associate
justices.
at
the
outset
of
my
portion
of
the
argument,
i
would
like
to
recall
to
the
court's
attention
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
criminal
contempt,
not
civil
contempt.
we
are
not
looking
to
a
procedure
in
the
court
below
which
has,
as
any
of
its
intention,
the
enforcement
of
orders
of
the
court.
these
orders
have
been
enforced.
james
meredith
has
attended
the
university
of
mississippi.
he
has
graduated
from
that
institution.
the
function
of
judicial
process
in
this
case
has
run
its
course
to
completion.
the
possibility
of
frustration
or
nullification
of
that
process
has
passed.
this
is
criminal
contempt.
the
species
or
variety
of
the
contempt
power
of
the
court
that
looks
to
punishment,
criminal
punishment
--
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir,
your
honor.
criminal
contempt
is
a
term-honored
form
of
the
contempt
power.
we
are
here
concerned
with
how
that
power
can
be
exercised
under
the
constitutional
safeguards
of
the
united
states
of
america,
and
the
point
that
i
make
is
that,
while
civil
contempt
is
a
procedure
in
which
the
court
is
seeking
to
have
its
decree
enforced
and
to
bring
the
parties
who
might
be
thought
to
be
recalcitrant
into
compliance
with
this
decree,
this
form
of
civil
contempt
has
none
of
the
procedural
safeguards
that
this
court
has
been
willing
in
the
past
to
apply
to
criminal
contempt
and
what
this
court
is
seeking
to
do
is
to
punish,
is
to
inflict
a
penal
sanction,
is
to
vindicate,
reek
vengeance
upon
someone
who
it
says
it
has
reason
to
believe
has,
in
the
past,
violated
its
decree
or
come
across
its
decree.
this
is
the
point
that
i
would
make,
sir.
on
page
--
well,
your
honors
don't
have
this.
we
ask
that
the
argument
yesterday
be
transcribed
and
we
were
furnished
last
night
with
the
copy
of
the
transcript,
and
the
honorable
solicitor
general
points
out
in
his
argument
that,
in
this
particular
situation,
we
are
less
concerned
with
punishment
than
with
further
compliance.
this
causes
me
to
want
to
begin
at
the
point
of
urging
to
your
honors
that
there
is
a
very
vital
distinction
between
civil
contempt
which
seeks
to
bring
about
compliance,
which
imposes
a
conditional
sanction.
just
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
when
it
said
to
the
governor
and
the
lieutenant
governor
"now,
if
this
order
is
not
complied
with
and
your
compliance
is
not
shown
to
this
court
by
the
2nd
day
of
october,
then
fines
of
$10,000
a
day
and
imprisonment
will
be
imposed
upon
you.
bring
yourself
out
of
the
area
of
conflict
with
our
decree."
this
was
a
civil
sanction
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument.
i
think
that
they
departed
from
the
statute
when
they
imposed
both
fine
and
imprisonment,
but
that's
an
entirely
side
issue.
i
think
they
exceeded
their
statutory
powers.
but,
that
was
civil
contempt
and
as
your
honors
pointed
out
in
your
questions
to
counsel
opposite
here
yesterday,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
goldberg,
this
civil
decree
was
entered
and
after
its
entry,
meredith
did
attend
the
university
and
did
graduate
there
from.
mr.
charles
clark
your
honor,
the
criminal
contempt
proceedings
were
not
commenced
until
an
order
was
entered
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
november,
15,
1962.
at
the
time
of
the
entry
of
this
order,
james
meredith
was
enrolled
in
the
university
of
mississippi
and
had
been,
since
the
1st
day
of
october,
45
days.
the
honorable
solicitor
general
also
says
that
the
constitutional
phase
of
our
argument
is
controlled
by
the
decision
of
these
court
in
green
versus
united
states.
we
take
a
contrary
position.
we
say
that
it
is
not
controlled
by
the
green
case
for
the
reason
that,
in
this
situation,
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
at
the
instance
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
passed
a
law.
it
was
part
of
the
criminal
code
section
1509
of
title
18.
it
made
that
interference
with
court
decrees
by
persons
who
were
not
parties
to
the
proceedings
a
violation
of
the
criminal
law
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
permitted
the
imposition
of
criminal
sanctions.
this
was
not
so
in
the
green
case.
bail
jumping
was
not
an
offense
at
the
time
that
gilbert
green
left
the
area
of
the
courtroom.
mr.
charles
clark
if
your
honor
please,
the
distinction
that
i
would
make
to
you
immediately
in
the
shipp
case,
borne
out
from
my
examination
of
the
records
of
the
case
in
this
court,
is
that
shipp
did
not
demand
a
jury,
as
was
his
constitutional
right
and
of
course,
it
was
his
constitutional
prerogative
to
waive
his
right
to
jury
which
he
did
because
the
record
of
this
court
shows
that
the
shipp-defendants
considered
to
the
taking
of
the
testimony
by
a
commissioner.
so,
i
would
--
mr.
charles
clark
no
sir.
they
just
--
the
constitutional
issue
which
i
make
to
your
honors
here
this
morning
just
wasn't
erased.
of
course
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
be
accorded
a
trial
by
jury
where
he's
willing
to
waive
that
right.
i
think
this
is
acknowledged
by
everyone,
sir.
i
believe
that
that
is
the
vital
distinction
between
what
we
urge
to
your
honor
here
and
the
shipp
case
as
controlling
precedent.
shipp
was
not
tried
with
a
jury
and
i
might
say,
it
would
be
appropriate
at
this
time
to
comment
on
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
that,
at
one
page
in
his
brief,
he
had
delineated
approximately
15
cases
of
criminal
contempt
tried
in
the
courts
of
appeal.
i
have
done
my
best
to
become
acquainted
with
every
one
of
those
cases
and
i
make
the
statement
without
any
fear
of
contradiction
to
your
honors
that
not
single
one
of
those
cases
involved
the
demand
for
a
trial
by
jury.
there
were
two
really
comparable
cases
or
a
group
of
them.
one
of
them
was
not
actually
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
argument.
they
both
drew
out
of
the
matter
that
was
here
before
this
court,
styled
in
re
mckenzie.
a
receiver
had
been
appointed
in
state
of
alaska
around
the
turn
of
the
century,
i
believe
it
was
in
1900
exactly,
to
become
--
to
operate
certain
gold
claims
in
the
state
of
alaska.
then
the
ninth
circuit
granted
an
appeal
from
the
order
refusing
to
dissolve
the
receivership
and
in
the
course
of
its
granting
of
that
order
by
a
single
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
issued
a
stay.
then,
the
claim
was
made
that
mr.
mckinley,
the
receiver
had
violated
the
stay
order
of
the
single
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
by
refusing
to
turnover
to
the
other
defendants,
in
the
--
the
other
parties
in
the
receivership
proceedings
the
gold
dust
and
gold
nuggets
that
he
had
possession
of
at
that
time.
out
of
this
refusal
and
by
the
way,
mr.
mckenzie
had
a
conflict
between
the
orders
of
the
district
court
and
the
orders
of
the
court
of
appeals
but,
out
of
this
situation,
there
grew
two
criminal
contempt
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit,
one
in
which
mr.
mckenzie
was
jailed
for
six
months
and
one
in
which
his
attorney
was
jailed
for
three
months
for
giving
him
the
advice
that
the
order
--
the
stay
order
did
not
mean
that
he
had
to
turn
over
the
gold.
these
two
cases,
i
say,
grew
out
of
that,
but
i
have
examined
the
records
that
are
here
before
this
court,
in
your
library
upstairs,
and
there
was
no
demand
by
mr.
mckenzie
or
by
his
attorney
for
a
trial
by
jury.
so,
again,
the
issue
was
not
raised
in
that
case.
the
other
comparable
case
was
in
re
door,
d-o-o-r.
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
use
of
the
mails
to
transmit
obscene
matter
was
charged
in
connection
with
an
investigation
by
the
postal
department,
and
door
was
acted
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sense
that
he
was
enjoined
pending
the
time
the
appeal
of
this
case
was
to
be
tracked
and
they
claimed
that
he
violated
--
again,
the
ninth
circuit
claimed
that
he
violated
that
injunction
that
was
on
him.
door
did
not
demand
a
trial
by
jury
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
says
so.
i
do
not
think
that
there
has
ever
been
a
situation
in
which
a
demand
for
a
trial
by
jury
of
an
offense
--
correction
--
a
demand
for
a
trial
by
jury
in
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
where
the
subject
matter
of
the
alleged
contempt
was
clearly
a
true
crime,
as
opposed
to
amounting
to
a
crime
under
the
common
law
or
equal
to
a
crime,
was
a
true
crime
if
proved
where
a
demand
for
a
constitutional
trial
by
jury
was
made
and
refused.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
has
ever
had
that
question
before
and
i
believe
that
it
is
a
question
of
first
impression
and
not
controlled
by
the
green
case.
mr.
charles
clark
your
honor,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
do
not
know.
of
course
there
have
been
many
criminal
contempt
cases
tried
by
jury
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
charles
clark
but
i
know
of
none
--
i
know
of
none
in
the
courts
of
appeal.
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
all
involved
appeals
for
administrative
procedures.
and
of
course,
the
very
first
time
that
these
matters
ever
reached
a
court
of
law
is
when
they
come
into
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
course,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
contempt
of
an
administrative
proceeding
and
where
nlrb
or
ftc
enters
a
requirement
that
a
person
perform
a
certain
thing
or
do
a
certain
act
and
then
an
appeal
is
made
from
that
and
the
court
of
appeals
says,
"yes
the
order
is
valid
now,
obey
it.”
then
the
only
type
of
contempt
power
that
could
be
exercised
would
be
a
contempt
of
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
this
is
what
was
involved
in
every
other
one
of
the
proceedings
cited
by
the
solicitor,
none
of
which
bore
any
evidence
of
a
demand
for
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir,
mr.
goldberg
--
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
do
not
make
that
contention
and
i
have
expressly
excluded
it
from
my
brief.
i
do
not
--
mr.
charles
clark
it
could
be
punished
under
the
statute.
it
would
be
crime.
but,
here,
we
are
talking
with,
again,
a
species
or
subspecies
of
the
contempt
power
in
which
the
court
itself,
with
its
own
eyes,
sees
the
matter.
it
--
it's
in
the
focus
of
the
court's
hearing
and
in
the
focus
of
the
court's
eyes.
we
do
have
a
case
that
control
that,
in
re
terry,
in
which
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
and
the
only
point
that
i
make
to
your
honors
is
that
there
is
a
need
for
the
immediacy
of
the
remedy
in
that
case
which
i
think
differentiates
it
from
any
other
claim
of
a
right
to
proceed
summarily
where
something
has
happened
hours,
days,
weeks,
or
months
later.
there
is
not
the
same
urgency
to
correct
the
situation
that
interferes
with
the
administration
of
justice.
i
know
that
your
honors
are
familiar
with
the
works
of
mr.
edward
livingston.
mr.
livingston
would
have
only,
your
honor,
taken
this
person
out
of
the
way
of
the
court.
where
his
obstreperousness
was
interfering
with
the
conduct
of
a
trial,
he
would
have
just
had
him
physically
removed
for
the
day
and
then,
if
he
came
back
the
next
day
and
persisted
in
his
conduct,
he
would
have
removed
him
again.
he
would
have
never
imposed
a
penal
sanction.
i
would
not
go
that
far
with
your
honors.
i
recognize
that
this
creates
a
situation
that
could
break
down
a
trial,
and
the
point
that
i
would
make
with
you
above
all
is
that
what
i
am
urging
here
is
not
anything
that's
going
to
keep
a
court
from
functioning.
what
i
am
urging
to
you
is
that,
when
you
impose
a
penal
sanction
in
a
criminal
trial,
it
ought
to
be
done
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
by
a
jury
procedure
where
the
defendant
demands
it.
this,
i
think,
is
a
simple
summation
of
what
my
constitutional
point
is
to
you.
if
i
may,
i
don't
want
to
be
presumptuous
to
the
court
but,
just
for
emphasis,
article
iii
section
2
clause
3
of
the
constitution
says,
and
of
course
has
said
since
the
day
it
was
written,
that
the
trial
of
all
crimes,
except
in
impeachment
cases
--
except
in
impeachment
cases,
shall
be
by
jury.
there's
only
one
exception
in
that
statue.
it's
an
exception
of
a
procedure
that
is
sui
generis,
if
one
ever
was.
i
mean,
the
trials
of
impeachments
are
really
peculiar
animals
under
the
law,
but
that's
the
only
exception
and
i
make
the
point
with
your
honors
that
it's
a
much
stronger
point
in
my
favor
because
the
exception
is
there,
that
it
would
be
if
it
had
not
been
there,
even
though
trials
by
impeachment
are
clearly
provided
for
elsewhere
in
the
constitution.
here,
they
thought
it
necessary
to
call
out
this
right
in
the
savings
clause
that
save
to
the
citizens
the
right
to
be
tried
by
juries
in
this
country
for
crimes.
from
a
great
dissatisfaction
with
the
way
the
constitution
was
originally
written,
the
congress,
in
its
first
meeting,
put
into
the
constitution
the
bill
of
rights
and
here
again,
in
the
sixth
amendment.
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
speedy
and
public
trial
by
an
impartial
jury.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
they
are
words
that
leave
absolutely
no
room
for
any
other
construction
in
a
case
such
as
we
have
here
where
a
court
is
seeking
vengeance,
where
a
court
seeks
to
punish
a
past
act.
i
think
that
the
constitution
very
elaborately
and
very
precisely
defines
exactly
what
my
client's
rights
are
and
i
think
that
this
court
should
make
a
holding
in
this
case
which
will
enforce
those
words
of
the
constitution
in
cases
of
this
type.
the
prosecution
has
been
able
to
develop
absolutely
no
history
that
will
support
any
other
construction,
except
for
the
fact
that,
in
old
cases,
this
court
ruled
that
criminal
contempt
was
not
within
the
purview
of
these
sections.
if
your
honors
please,
this
is
a
different
case
from
those
cases
even
because
this
is
a
statutorily
defined
crime
if
the
defendants
are
guilty
of
this
act,
and
that
issue
has
never
been
before
you.
but,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
this
argument,
the
validity
of
terry
and
debs
and
the
other
cases
that
have
made
these
holdings,
i
say
to
your
honors,
the
error
is
one
of
the
commodities
that
does
not
improve
with
age
and
this
court,
i
urge
with
the
utmost
deference
and
respect,
should
recognize
that
older
decisions
which
do
not
grant
this
right
are
error.
the
constitution
has
meant
different
things
at
different
times
in
this
nation's
history
and
yet,
its
words
have
never
changed.
so,
what
i
urge
the
court
to
do
here
is
not
an
unheard
of
thing.
when
i
urge
you
to
depart
from
the
spirit
of
past
decisions
in
the
constitutional
field,
i'm
not
urging
something
that's
never
been
argued
to
you
before
and
i
am
very
sure,
will
not
be
argued
to
you
again.
i
don't
think
that
the
constitution
is
a
dead
document
and
i
think
that
this
court
will
constantly
be
asked
to
examine
its
decisions
in
the
constitutional
field.
but,
let
me
emphasize
that
i
make
this
point
only
in
argument
because
i
do
not
concede
that
this
case
that
we
have
here
today
has
ever
been
before
this
court
before,
and
i
make
the
point
only
that
the
spirit
of
other
decisions
which
would
indicate
a
contrary
result
ought
not
be
allowed
to
control
this
case
because
i
don't
think
that
they
are
on
all
fours
with
the
case.
i
don't
think
that
they
were
the
issue
that
we
have
here
before
us.
one
bit
of
support
comes
from
mr.
madison
in
his
original
argument
to
the
congress
for
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights,
and
i
have
never
seen
it
quoted
heretofore,
and
if
i
may
ask
your
honors
indulgence
to
call
it
to
your
attention.
he
said
in
congress,
“in
the
declaration
of
rights
which
england
has
established,
the
truth
is
that
they've
gone
no
further
than
to
raise
a
barrier
against
the
power
of
the
crown.
the
power
of
the
legislature
is
left
altogether
indefinite.
although
i
know
that
whenever
the
great
rights
trial
by
jury,
freedom
of
the
press,
or
liberty
of
conscience
come
in
question
in
that
body,
the
parliament,
the
invasion
of
them
is
resisted
by
evil
advocates.
yet,
their
magna
carta
does
not
contain
any
one
provision
for
the
security
of
those
rights.
respecting
which,
the
people
of
america
are
most
alarmed.”
he
included
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
under
the
sixth
amendment
in
his
demands
for
first
amendment
protection
and
in
his
differentiation
of
the
law
of
england
and
the
law
of
the
united
states
in
this
regard.
continuing,
"but,
although
the
case
may
be
widely
different
and
it
may
not
be
thought
necessary
to
provide
limits
for
the
legislative
power
in
that
country,
yet,
a
different
opinion
prevails
in
the
united
states.”
this
quotation
is
from
1
annals
of
congress,
page
436.
mr.
charles
clark
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
charles
clark
as
i
--
mr.
charles
clark
thank
you,
sir.
i
acknowledge
two
errors.
i
acknowledge
the
error
in
not
finding
the
kennedy
versus
mendoza
case.
i
think
it
certainty
is
a
very
applicable
case
and
my
only
excuse
is
that,
because
it
did
not
dovetail
into
contempt
and
was
such
a
recent
decision,
i
missed
it.
well,
mr.
justice
moody
spoke
the
same
thing
for
the
court
in
twining
versus
new
jersey
when
he
said
that
if
the
procedures
of
england
were
brought
to
this
country
by
our
constitution,
then
the
procedures
of
the
first
half
of
the
17th
century
would
be
fastened
upon
american
jurisprudence
like
a
straitjacket,
only
to
be
loosened
by
amendments
to
the
constitution.
that
would
be
to
deny
every
quality
of
the
law
but
its
age
and
to
render
it
incapable
of
progress
or
improvement.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir,
your
honor,
and
if
i
may
just
make
one
additional
distinction.
i
make
this
only
by
way
of
argument
because
i
basically
do
not
concede
that
this
is
even
governed
--
mr.
charles
clark
--
by
us
versus
green
--
but,
i
say,
if
your
honors
say
that
the
spirit
of
green
moves
into
this
area,
then
i
do
say
to
your
honors,
respectfully
and
with
deference,
that
green
--
the
green
decision
ought
to
be
amended
to
the
extent
that
i
urge
here
today,
that
where
a
--
an
act
is
clearly
defined
as
a
breach
of
the
criminal
laws
of
the
united
states,
then
it
ought
to
be
punished
in
the
way
that
the
law
provides
for
crimes
to
be
punished.
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir.
green
--
the
green
demand
came
before
this
court
on
a
demand
for
indictment
by
a
grand
jury.
one
of
the
issues
that
we
raise
in
the
court
below
which
they
didn't
have
any
difficulty
with,
of
course,
because
of
the
decision
in
the
green
case.
they
overruled
our
motion
to
dismiss
the
criminal
contempt
charges
for
lack
of
a
grand
jury
presentment
in
indictment.
but,
that
was
the
issue
in
green,
as
i
concede
it,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
charles
clark
it
did
not
contain
--
it
did
not
reach
the
issue,
as
i
understood
the
case,
of
a
demand
for
trial
by
a
petit
jury
in
regular
criminal
proceedings.
it
discussed
the
application
of
the
constitution
to
criminal
contempt.
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir.
debs
--
in
the
debs
case,
the
jury
issue
was
involved.
and
in
the
debs
case,
the
thing
that
i
pointed
out
to
your
honors,
the
distinction
that
i
would
make
would
be
that
the
case,
here,
is
an
area
where
congress
has
defined
the
acts
as
crimes,
as
true
crimes.
in
the
debs
case,
this
was
an
injunction
granted
to
allow
the
mails,
they
said,
to
continue
to
flow.
i
think
that
the
quotations
in
the
case
from
the
leaders
of
the
strike
from
eugene
debs
and
his
so-called
lieutenants
indicate
that
they
considered
it
to
have
a
strike-breaking
effect
rather
than
the
effect
of
preventing
or
allowing
the
mails
to
continue
to
flow.
i
made
that
issue
in
my
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
the
court
issued
an
injunction.
and
of
course,
in
the
labor
field,
i
think
that
with
clayton
and
then
reinforced
by
norris-laguardia
when
this
court's
decisions
concerning
clayton
were
thought
to
be
not
adequate
enough
to
suit
the
wishes
of
congress
later,
by
the
norris-laguardia
act,
they
strengthened
the
rights
of
labor
to
be
exempted
from
the
types
of
procedure
that
we
have
here,
but
this
is
only
in
labor
cases.
in
the
kennedy
versus
mendoza
decision,
the
court
quoted
from
ex
parte
milligan
and
if
i
may,
again
with
the
court's
indulgence,
just
add
a
sentence
or
two
immediately
following
the
court's
quotation
there,
“because
of
the
fact
that
the
eminent
solicitor
argues
that
the
courts
need
to
have
this
power.”
this
is
--
this
is
why
it
should
be
done
because,
without
it,
we
are
not
going
to
have
satisfactory
administration
of
justice.
i'd
like
to
reply
more
in
detail
to
that
argument
in
just
a
minute.
but,
for
now,
let
me
say
i
address
myself
only
to
the
question
of
whether
need
can
create
a
right.
the
court
in
ex
parte
milligan
said
no
doctrine
involving
more
pernicious
consequences
was
ever
invented
by
the
will
of
man.
then,
that
any
of
its
provisions
to
the
constitution
can
be
suspended
during
any
of
the
great
exigencies
of
government.
such
a
doctrine
not
only
leads
to
anarchy
or
despotism
but
the
theory
of
necessity,
on
which
it
is
based,
is
false.
the
government,
within
the
constitution,
has
all
the
powers
granted
to
it
which
are
necessary
to
preserve
its
existence.
i
say
to
your
honors,
further,
that
the
constitution
impliedly
recognizes
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
addition
to
the
direct
recognitions
that
i
have
just
referred
to,
in
that,
the
fifth
amendment
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
i
think
that
this
court's
holding
in
griffin
versus
the
people
of
illinois
clearly
indicates
what
this
court
means
by
due
process
of
law.
and
i
am
not
urging
that
i
would
write
the
equal
protection
clause
into
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
for
the
federal
prerogative
sub
silentio.
but,
i
say
to
your
honors
that
you
have
already
decided
in
the
detroit
bank
case
and
in
others,
such
as
griffin,
that
when
an
action
establishes
or
when
a
procedure
establishes
a
markedly
different
path
for
two
people
that
are
identically
circumstanced
and
situated,
that
it
does
not
accord
due
process
of
law.
and
i
think
that
this
is
exactly
what
happens.
on
the
first
day,
when
the
government
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
the
defendants
in
this
case
were
interfering,
in
anyway,
with
the
orders
of
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
had
the
right
to
take
the
information
that
they
filed
with
the
court
of
appeals,
and
form
an
affidavit,
and
make
a
criminal
charge
against
these
persons.
this
was
their
prerogative
and
i
submit
to
your
honors,
their
only
prerogative,
insofar
as
criminal
sanctions
were
concerned.
and
i
--
let
me
again
emphasize,
i
do
not
speak
of
civil
contempt.
i
do
not
speak
of
any
of
the
multiple
ways
that
a
court
might
choose
to
say
to
a
person
who
is
obstructing
its
orders
or
interfering
with
compliance
with
these
orders
that
“unless
you
move
aside,
this
court
will
impose
a
civil
sanction
on
you.”
i'm
talking
about
now
punishment.
i'm
talking
about
punishment
for
the
past.
this
is
something
that
should
be
processed
under
1509,
and
i
think
to
say
to
the
government,
“well,
if
you
don't
feel
like
proceeding
under
1509,
just
go
back
to
the
court
and
start
an
independent
ancillary
action
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
has
no
original
jurisdiction,
and
then
cite
the
defendants
for
criminal
contempt
and
you
get
around
to
trial
by
jury
that
way.”
i
just
don't
think
that
this
can
be
made
to
square
up
with
due
process
of
law
and
--
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir.
i
would
say
this.
the
solicitor
made
a
point
that
i
think
provoked
the
attorney
general
to
ask
congress
to
pass
1509
and
this
was
that
the
processes
of
injunction
are
normally
construed
not
to
reach
to
non-parties,
except
those
persons
who
are
acting
as
agents
or
in
a
conspiracy
with
the
parties.
and
he
has
taken
a
position
here
that
this
did
not
include
the
governor
--
mr.
charles
clark
--
in
so
--
mr.
charles
clark
oh,
alright
sir.
absolutely
not,
there
isn't
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
argument
that
i
make
to
this
court
that
would
interfere
in
one
whit
with
the
exercise
of
the
imposition
of
civil
sanctions
to
bring
a
defendant
into
compliance
with
an
order.
surely,
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
court,
any
court
has
the
right
to
impose
civil
sanctions
and
say
to
a
defendant
“now,
unless
you
comply,
you
will
find
yourself
punished
thusly
by
imprisonment.
you
go
to
jail
until
you
are
ready
to
comply
or
you
pay
a
daily
fine.”
this
is
a
very
theoretical
distinction
on
fines
which
i
think
the
courts
have
not
gotten
around
to
making,
but
it's
too
far-fetched
to
go
into
here.
but,
these
civil
sanctions
in
which
the
defendant
carries
with
him
the
power
to
avoid
the
punishment
by
correcting
his
action
are
not
in
any
way
encompassed
within
what
i
argue
to
your
honors
today.
i'm
talking
about
solely
punishment.
and
i
submit
to
your
honor,
and
i
don't
want
to
evade
the
issue
with
you,
i
submit
to
you
that
if
your
procedures,
insofar
as
mr.
justice
black's
injunction
had
been
concerned,
had
been
criminal
procedures,
then
i
certainly
would
have
--
would
think
that
we
were
as
much
entitled
to
a
jury
in
this
courtroom
as
we
would
be
to
any
--
in
any
other
courtroom
in
the
land.
mr.
charles
clark
we
all
live
under
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
clark
in
the
district
in
which
the
alleged
crime
was
supposed
to
have
been
committed.
mr.
charles
clark
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
wished
that
i
was
capable
of
answering
your
question.
i
just
don't
know,
sir.
i
don't
know
which
it
would
have
been.
i
don't
know
whether
the
place
where
the
contemptuous
or
the
allegedly
contemptuous
acts
were
physically
done
or
the
site
of
the
court
--
mr.
charles
clark
--
controls
--
mr.
charles
clark
if
your
honor
decides,
with
the
point
that
i
urge
here,
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
accords
a
right
to
a
trial
by
jury,
then
it
would
have
to
be,
in
my
opinion,
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
and
we
have
additionally
urged,
i
might
say,
to
your
honor
that
the
matter
awe
upon
the
proper
judicial
administration
to
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
the
conduct
of
the
trial.
this
is
a
criminal
action.
the
court
as
the
--
as
the
eminent
solicitor
argues
in
his
brief,
the
court
is
not
involved
in
any
way.
it
simply
sits
as
the
judge,
as
the
arbiter
of
the
courtroom,
and
governs
the
proceedings.
so,
i
see
absolutely
nothing
to
the
claim
of
the
solicitor
that
only
the
court
of
appeals
could
preside
at
the
trial.
i
think
the
court
could
do
just
exactly
what
was
done
by
the
district
court
in
texas
and
send
the
case
to
any
court
having
jurisdiction
for
a
regular
criminal
processing.
i
think
this
is
what
the
constitution
means
when
it
accords
due
process.
i
think
this
is
what
the
constitution
means
when
it
accords
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
mr.
charles
clark
from
the
district
in
which
the
act
--
mr.
charles
clark
well,
let
me
get
our
bounds
on
the
constitution.
i
have
reference
to
the
sixth
amendment
in
my
mind,
but
i
want
the
exact
words
before
your
honors.
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
and
public
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
of
the
state
and
district
wherein
the
crime
shall
have
been
committed.
and
my
discussions
with
mr.
justice
harlan
were
meant
to
indicate
that
my
doubts
are
where
does
the
crime
occur?
or
--
mr.
charles
clark
does
--
mr.
charles
clark
if
there
was
a
crime,
if
what
these
people
are
accused
of
doing
had
been
done,
it
would
have
been
an
interference
with
or
an
obstruction
to
a
court
order.
mr.
charles
clark
this,
again,
puts
me
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
if
you
mean
to
use
this
case
because
we
had
an
order
of
the
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
the
state
of
mississippi
that
was
as
much
contempt
as
any
other.
we
had
the
charges
here.
those
are
of
a
court
of
appeals
which
sits
in
atlanta,
and
in
new
orleans,
and
in
houston,
and
in
other
points
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
and
i
just
don't
know
whether
when
the
constitution
means
--
when
the
constitution
says
where
the
crime
shall
have
been
committed,
it
means,
in
the
case
of
the
contempt
of
a
court
order,
the
place
where
the
acts
were
done,
which
occurred
in
both
the
northern
and
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
or
whether
it
means
the
place
where
the
court
that
issued
the
order
sat.
in
other
words,
does
the
contempt
occur
in
the
act
or
does
the
contempt
occur
to
the
presence
of
the
court?
and
this
is
what
i
mean
to
have
a
dilemma
about.
but
--
mr.
charles
clark
your
honor
must
have
reference
to
brailsford
--
mr.
charles
clark
i
--
i
wished
that
i
knew,
sir,
but
i
don't.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
clark
it
cited
philadelphia
--
mr.
charles
clark
my
understanding
was
that
there
were
two
other
jury
matters
before
the
supreme
court
in
related
--
or
in
unrelated
cases,
but
about
the
same
time.
but,
i
am
unable
to
supply
the
court
with
any
information.
mr.
charles
clark
it's
the
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
your
honor,
just
one
second.
mr.
charles
clark
it
won't
take
but
a
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
two
district
courts
in
the
state
of
texas
that
were
involved.
mr.
charles
clark
they
were
federal
courts
--
federal
district
courts,
yes,
sir.
the
federal
district
court
in
one
district
referred
the
contempt
to
the
place
where
the
act
was
committed
for
the
trial
of
the
alleged
contempt
of
court,
and
this
is
the
only
--
mr.
charles
clark
it
was
houston
versus
north
texas
motor
freight
lines,
inc.
houston
and
north
texas
motor
freight
lines,
inc.
versus
local
745
and
the
citation
is
27
f.supp.154.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir,
district
court
only.
but,
the
district
court
there
interpreted
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
as
--
mr.
charles
clark
--
to
be
jury
of
the
district
where
the
act
was
committed
rather
than
where
the
court
sat.
i
think
the
court
sat
in
dallas
and
they
referred
the
matter
to
houston
is
my
best
recollection.
i
might
call
to
your
honors'
attention
that
i've
made
a
call
to
typographical
error
to
be
made
in
the
brief
and
that
the
correct
citation
of
that
case
is
page
154
of
27
federal
supplement
instead
of
the
citation.
mr.
charles
clark
if
it
exist
--
mr.
charles
clark
the
summary
contempt
power,
sir?
mr.
charles
clark
is
--
i
only
mean
to
imply
to
you
a
bigger
bite
than
i
--
than
i'm
asking
the
court
to
take.
but,
here,
i
recognize
the
fundamental
distinction
to
an
immediate
interference
with
the
ongoing
of
the
trial.
in
other
words,
when
the
court
is
on
the
bench
and
someone
creates
a
disturbance
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
which
will
not
allow
the
trial
to
continue,
then
whether
you
call
it
criminal
or
civil,
i
think
this
is
probably
the
real
problem,
the
court
has
the
right
to
get
this
obstruction
out
of
its
way
summarily.
it
would
have
to
have.
mr.
charles
clark
that's
right.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir,
and
the
only
thing
that
i
say,
judge,
is
my
basic
puzzlement
is
whether
or
not
it's
truly
penal
or
civil.
i
think
that
it
was
--
it's
a
form
of
civil
contempt
actually,
unless
the
court
says
“go
to
jail
for
six
months.”
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
let
me
just
say
this
then,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
pray
to
admit
that
point
from
my
argument.
i
agree
with
the
rationalization
that
you
make
entirely
and
i
think
that,
as
i
say,
that
the
need
is
--
must
answer
to
civil
sanctions.
and
if
terry
--
if
i
were
arguing
to
this
court
in
terry,
i'd
take
the
same
position
i
take
here
today
if
my
client
had
been
sentenced
to
six
months
in
jail
as
terry.
i
believe
terry
was
sentenced
to
six
months.
mr.
justice
field
was
involved
and
i
--
that's
my
recollection.
they
had
a
continuing
fight
and
of
course,
as
a
result
of
this
matter,
the
case
of
in
re
neagle
came
up,
which
has
been
cited
in
the
court
in
another
connection.
but,
continuing
mr.
justice
black,
this
section
of
the
constitution
provides
in
the
district
wherein
the
crime
shall
have
been
committed,
which
district
shall
have
previously
been
ascertained
by
law.
and
my
only
question
about
where
it
would
go,
whether
in
new
orleans
or
one
of
the
other
spots
where
the
fifth
circuit
sits
or
into
jackson,
mississippi.
and
by
the
way,
they
were
sitting
in
hattiesburg,
mississippi
at
the
time
that
they
originally
issued
the
amicus
order
to
the
united
states.
the
panel
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
issued
the
order
was
sitting
in
hattiesburg
which
is
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
which
is
one
of
the
points
where
the
alleged
contempts
took
place.
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir,
except
that
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
black.
if
this
court
holds,
as
i
submit
that
it
should,
that
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
is
a
constitutional
right,
then
i
think
that
you
must
accord
us
the
full
constitutional
right
and
the
only
thing
that
i
tell
you
is
so
that
i'm
not
prepared
to
state
to
this
court
categorically
where
the
district
is
located
that
has
this
criminal
element
in
it.
i
just
don't
know
so
--
whether
the
court
was
concerned
that
the
place
where
the
court
sat
--
mr.
charles
clark
but
has
to
come
from
the
district.
mr.
charles
clark
at
that
point,
and
take
the
jury
--
mr.
charles
clark
--
from
that
district.
mr.
charles
clark
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
yes
sir,
that
they
must
follow
the
constitution
completely
and
not
halfway.
i
just
don't
think
that
--
mr.
charles
clark
--
we
can
have
some
of
it.
mr.
charles
clark
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
but,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
understood
mr.
justice
black
taking
a
step
further
and
say
--
ask
me
what
i
would
say
about
the
district,
and
my
only
point
is,
being
frank
with
the
court
and
candid
with
the
court,
that
if
the
holding
of
the
court
is
that
trial
by
jury
is
a
right
granted
to
us
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
then
necessarily,
when
this
case
gets
back
to
the
dis
--
to
the
court
of
appeals,
they're
going
to
have
to
decide
what
district
the
alleged
crime
was
committed
in
and
that's
where
the
jury
is
going
to
have
to
come
from.
now,
whether
the
jury
will
come
to
court
or
the
court
will
go
to
the
jury
is,
again,
something
that's
not
included
in
my
argument
here.
but,
do
you
see
what
i
mean,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir.
i
think
if
your
honors
decide
that
it's
a
constitutional
right,
then,
of
course,
there's
the
constitution
and
the
court
below
must
interpret
the
constitution,
commence
it
with
the
other
decisions
of
this
court
in
that
area.
if
you
say
we
have
a
trial
--
a
right
of
trial
by
jury
under
statutes
--
under
the
clayton
act
statutes,
then
this
leaves
the
district
question
open
completely.
but,
i
would
say
that
if
you
decide
on
the
constitutional
basis,
i
think
you
would
necessarily
foreclose
one
area
of
decision
by
the
court
below,
sir.
do
i
make
myself
clear
on
that?
mr.
charles
clark
alright.
mr.
charles
clark
mr
--
mr.
charles
clark
we've
never
made
that
contention,
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
for
the
purpose
of
my
argument
here,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
say
that
the
cases
of
the
past
are
the
reason
and
the
statute
of
the
rule
of
this
court,
42
(a),
are
the
reason
that
i
would
not
urge
this
issue
to
you
now.
it's
not
encompassed
within
the
question
that
i
have,
except
by
indirection.
but,
i
do
want
to
say
to
you
and
to
mr.
justice
goldberg
that,
on
a
rational
basis,
i
think
that
the
only
power
that
the
judge
ought
to
exercise
even
in
a
summary
situation
is
the
power
of
removing
the
obstruction
quickly
and
efficiently
from
his
courtroom.
mr.
charles
clark
then,
dealing
with
the
--
then
dealing
with
the
contemptor
under
regular
criminal
process.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
well,
it's
just
--
mr.
charles
clark
it's
so
far
out
--
it's
so
far-field
from
my
argument.
it's
my
own
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir,
and
i
--
rationally,
logically,
exactly
what
you
say
is
so.
this
would
be
my
contention
if
i
were
here
in
the
terry
case.
i
would
contend
that
terry
was
unconstitutionally
dealt
with
by
being
sentenced
to
six
months
in
jail.
i
would
urge
to
your
honors
the
adoption
of
the
philosophy
of
mr.
edward
livingston
that
these
contempts
ought
to
be
pushed
aside
--
these
contempt
orders
are
ought
to
be
pushed
aside
immediately
by
the
court,
so
it
can
get
on
with
its
business.
but,
when
it
comes
to
dealing
with
a
true
crime
that
the
court
ought
to
deal
with
that
person
charged
with
that
crime
under
the
regular
criminal
processes
of
law
and
not
summarily
without
a
jury.
mr.
charles
clark
the
constitution
require
--
mr.
charles
clark
the
constitution
requires
exactly
what
i
urge
to
your
honor
this
moment.
it
requires
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
clark
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i'm
not
making
myself
clear
to
the
court
and
it
concerns
me.
if
i
will
make
the
appearance
here
that
counsel
did
in
the
terry
case,
i
am
bound
to
claim,
and
i
believe
emphatically,
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
would
have
demanded
that
terry
be
sentenced
to
six
months
in
jail
only
after
he
had
been
found
guilty
by
a
jury,
if
he
had
demanded
a
jury.
and
--
mr.
charles
clark
--
this
issue
was
in
the
terry
case.
mr.
charles
clark
it's
not
a
question
of
construing
a
matter
of
the
words
of
the
constitution.
it's
a
--
it's
question
of
differentiating
between
what
is
a
civil
sanction
and
what's
a
penal
sanction.
i
say
that
anytime
a
penal
sanction
is
imposed,
it
must
be
imposed
under
the
terms
of
the
constitution
providing
for
punishment
crimes.
mr.
charles
clark
and
--
mr.
charles
clark
it's
--
it's
a
purely
criminal
sanction,
as
i
say.
in
that
case,
i
would
have
to
contend
--
mr.
charles
clark
--
and
would
contend
--
mr.
charles
clark
that
the
--
that
the
right
of
that
defendant
had
been
breached
in
the
sense
that,
if
he
asked
for
a
jury
trial,
he
must
be
accorded
under
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
clark
well
--
mr.
charles
clark
i
see
no
--
i
see
no
other
way
around
that.
i
--
this
is
--
this
is
an
absolute
bar.
as
i
say,
the
only
--
the
only
hesitancy
i
had
to
answer
you
in
the
first
place
was
because
it's
not
the
immediate
point
that
i
have
here.
it's
just
something
that
i
had
pretermitted
from
argument
because
it
was
not
the
case
before
the
court.
it's
not
to
certify
the
question.
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir,
and
this
court
has
even
--
mr.
charles
clark
this
court
--
this
court
had
said
that
--
mr.
charles
clark
then
he
could
--
mr.
charles
clark
yes,
sir.
this
court
has
said
though,
your
honor
please,
that
where
time
and
circumstances
do
permit,
and
i
think
that
the
rule
says
so
too,
that
where
time
and
circumstances
permit,
that
the
matter
of
contempt
should
be
referred
to
another
judge
for
hearing
where
it's
going
to
be
a
summary
trial.
let
me,
at
this
juncture
in
the
argument,
if
i
may,
make
a
retort
or
rebuttal
to
the
solicitor's
argument
of
yesterday.
he
admits
that
the
united
states
had
no
right
to
participate
in
meredith
versus
fair
on
behalf
of
either
of
the
private
litigants.
but,
he
says,
when
it
occurred
to
the
government
that
a
violation
of
section
1509
had
occurred
that
“they,”
and
i
quote
him
literally
here,
“accordingly,
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
there,
commenced”
what
on
page
33
of
my
transcript
he
describes
as
this,
“a
supplementary
ancillary
independent
action."
i
believe
that
these
words
are
self-contradictory.
i
don't
believe
that
you
can
have
a
supplementary,
ancillary,
independent
action.
if
it's
ancillary,
it's
not
independent.
if
it's
independent,
it's
not
ancillary.
i
would
also
take
issue,
completely
and
categorically,
with
a
statement
made
by
the
eminent
solicitor
in
the
course
of
his
argument
that
he
was
faced
with
the
dilemma
of
a
district
court
which
would
--
which
either
couldn't
do
anything
during
the
time
of
judge
cameron's
stays
or,
after
he
had
been
given
the
opportunity,
it
declined
to
act.
as
i
read
the
federal
rules,
and
i
have
reference
to
rule
7
(b),
any
time
that
a
person
moves
a
district
court
to
perform
an
act,
it
being
a
court
of
record,
that
motion
must
be
made
in
writing.
and
if
any
article
of
this
argument
of
the
solicitor
is
to
be
taken
so
as
to
prejudice
the
least
of
my
client's
rights,
then
i
think
that
this
court
is
required
to
get
the
full
facts.
i
have
here
on
the
table
a
certificate
from
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
which
says
that
there
never
was
a
motion
filed
by
the
united
states
of
america
for
leave
to
intervene
in
the
district
court
of
the
state
of
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
as
amicus
curiae
throughout
the
entire
history
of
the
merited
proceedings.
we
are
here
on
this
prong
of
his
argument
contending
about
conversations
that
are
completely
deposed
of
the
record.
later
in
his
argument,
he
says
that,
at
a
stage
in
the
procedure,
the
court
of
appeals
required
him
to
make
a
second
entreaty
to
the
district
court
to
be
allowed
to
act
in
that
court,
and
that
that
second
entreaty
was
denied
and
that
it
is
shown
in
the
certified
record
here
before
this
court.
when
mr.
jaworski
replies
to
my
argument,
i
would
ask
him
to
enlighten
both
the
court
and
myself
as
to
where
this
second
appeal
occurred.
the
only
thing
that
i
am
able
to
find
in
any
part
of
the
certificate
before
this
court
relating
to
an
intercession
or
a
motion
or
a
plea
for
the
district
court
to
perform
any
act
that
it
did
not
perform
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
"ascertained"
that
the
district
court
was
unwilling
to
admit
the
united
states
into
it's
court
as
amicus
curiae.
i
find
nothing
else
in
the
certified
question,
and
i
made
the
point
in
my
brief
that
this
matter
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
clark
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
am
saying
that
if
a
man
is
to
be
treated
with
--
for
a
criminal
offense
that
could
result
in
the
deprivation
of
his
property
and
his
liberty,
that
whatever
is
going
to
affect
his
rights
are
to
be
shown
in
the
record
of
court.
mr.
charles
clark
i
am
unable
to
do
that,
sir.
i
think
that,
whatever
judge
of
the
court
would
be
involved
would
be
the
final
arbiter
of
that.
i
know
nothing
of
it.
and
i
only
point
out
to
you
that
if
it's
to
have
the
slightest
affect
on
the
defendants
rights,
then
i
think
the
court
ought
to
get
the
record
before
it
and
i
think
the
record
ought
to
be
the
basis
for
its
action
because
i
do
take
firm
issue
with
the
government.
the
only
time
that
judge
mize
was
asked
to
do
something
by
the
government
in
the
form
of
written
plea
that
he
acted
on,
he
granted
the
injunction
against
meredith's
arrest.
he
proceeded
on
one-day's
notice
to
try
the
chancellor
of
the
university,
the
registrar
of
the
university,
and
the
dean
of
the
school
for
civil
contempt.
he
did
arrive
in
an
acquittal
of
civil
contempt
that
day.
but,
let
me
point
to
your
honors
that
those
same
three
people
were
immediately
taken
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
charged
in
that
court
with
the
contempt
of
an
identical
order,
and
there's
an
order
on
the
records
of
the
court
of
appeals
finding
that
those
people
are
not
in
contempt
and
were
never
in
contempt
of
the
court's
order.
so,
he's
been
affirmed
in
that
action
and
he
did
not
refuse
to
act.
he
did
not
delay
justice,
and
i
make
that
in
the
most
positive
manner
that
i
can
make
to
state.
i
have
gotten
too
verbose.
i
think
that
the
court
should
consider
the
basis
for
the
decision
that
it's
asked
to
make
here
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
the
court
should
be
cognizant
of
the
fact
that,
so
many
times,
you've
pointed
out
yourselves
that
this
court
doesn't
have
the
power
of
the
sword
or
the
purse.
the
way
that
this
court
brings
about
its
desired
results
is
by
appealing
to
the
minds
and
the
hearts
of
men
as
a
basis
that
what
we
say
is
right.
you
don't
just
write
a
decree
out
and
say
“judgment
for
the
defendant.”
the
court
tries
to
say
why
a
judgment
for
the
defendant
ought
to
be
issued.
the
court
tries
to
say
why
a
case
ought
to
be
tried
in
a
certain
way.
this
is
because
the
basis
for
enforcement
comes
from
an
appeal
to
reason.
this
is
nothing
but
a
piece
of
paper.
the
mendoza
decision,
nothing
but
a
piece
of
paper,
except
that
when
people
read
the
words
on
it,
it
appeals
to
them.
it
has
a
meaning
to
them
and
they
are
willing
to
abide
by
it.
i
--
i
say
--
mr.
charles
clark
also
--
mr.
charles
clark
no,
sir,
but
i
say
that
this
is
the
basis
of
the
judicial
power,
mr.
stewart
--
mr.
justice
stewart.
this
is
how
it
functions.
it
doesn't
function
because
the
judiciary
has
the
right
to
call
up
the
army.
in
every
case,
if
it's
going
to
involve
that,
it
has
to
get
over
into
the
executive
department.
you're
familiar,
of
course,
with
--
mr.
charles
clark
with
hamilton
--
i
mean,
with
the
statement
that
jackson
made.
mr.
justice
marshall
had
made
his
order,
let
him
enforce
it,
and
mr.
justice
warren
put
it
more
aptly
than
i
can.
we
must
remain
vigilant
to
preserve
the
principles
of
our
bill
of
rights
lest,
in
our
desire
to
be
secure,
we
lose
our
ability
to
be
free.
and
i
think
that
this
is
the
rational
principle
that
i
would
appeal
to
the
court
on,
that
necessity
is
not
the
governing
doctrine.
that
this
court
has
the
power
in
civil
contempt,
just
as
every
other
court
does,
to
deal
with
any
contemptuous
act
and
bring
about
compliance.
nobody
nullified
the
decree.
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
the
situation
that
we
have.
the
solicitor
talks
of
jury
trials
which
would
deny
a
court
its
right
to
vengeance,
but
i
would
speak
of
the
glory
of
the
english
law.
he
speaks
of
whims
of
unsympathetic
jurors,
and
i
would
talk
to
you
about
this
principle,
excellency.
he
speaks
of
the
certainty
of
enforcement,
and
i
would
speak
to
you
of
the
birthright
of
free
men.
thank
you.
