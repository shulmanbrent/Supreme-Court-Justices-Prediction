mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
which
is
brought
by
the
appellees
as
a
class
action
to
challenge
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
texas,
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
texas
and
ordinances
of
the
city
of
fort
worth
which
require
essentially
that
to
vote
in
an
election
to
authorize
the
issuance
of
general
obligation
bonds,
the
voter
must
rendered
either
personal
or
real
property
or
both
for
taxation.
this
is
of
course
is
the
legal
obligation
of
all
texas
citizens.
the
three-judge
district
courts
sitting
in
the
northern
district
of
texas
found
that
various
sections
of
our
constitution,
of
our
statutes
and
of
the
ordinances
or
chart
of
the
city
of
fort
worth
were
unconstitutional.
it
said
they
are
hereby
declared
unconstitutional
in
so
far
as
they
condition
the
right
to
vote
in
bond
elections
on
citizens
rendering
property
for
taxation.
injunctive
relief
was
granted
and
the
appellant's
were
ordered
to
give
effect
to
certain
votes
in
an
election,
the
election
which
was
in
question
here.
i
would
like
to
state
our
argument
very
briefly
if
i
may
and
then
elaborate
on
it
as
time
permits.
i
think
the
first
point
we
would
make
is
that
the
attack
on
our
constitution
is
based
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
clause.
a
condition
to
the
invoking
of
that
clause
is
that
there
be
some
classification.
it
is
our
position
and
i
think
we
can
show
that
there
is
no
classification
involved
here
that
all
residence
of
the
state
of
texas
are
qualified
to
vote
in
these
elections.
the
second
point
i
would
make
is
that
if
there
is
a
classification,
nevertheless,
we're
not
talking
here
about
whether
or
not
the
citizens
of
town
--
county
of
fort
worth
may
vote
on
the
question
for
instance
of
whether
or
not
they
can
build
a
library.
the
vote
in
question
was
on
whether
or
not
$6,860,000.00
should
be
financed
to
the
cost
of
the
library,
should
be
financed
by
bonds
payable
from
taxes,
on
rendered
real
and
personal
property.
it
is
the
policy
of
the
state
of
texas
that
only
those
who
obey
the
law,
which
does
require
that
everyone
render
his
property
and
who
do
render
their
property
and
pay
taxes
on
it,
although
the
payment
of
taxes
is
not
a
prerequisite,
should
be
entitled
to
vote.
the
statutes
declare
that
all
property,
real,
personal,
mixed,
except
that
which
is
subject
to
--
i'm
sorry
--
except
that
which
is
exempt
is
subject
to
taxation
and
shall
be
rendered
and
listed
between
january
1st
and
april
30th
of
each
year.
they
run
business
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
believe
you
do
because
for
instance
as
to
personal
property,
the
exemption
is
a
dollar
amount.
i
don't
know
how
you
would
take
the
exemption
unless
you
rendered
it.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
to
be
very
honest,
i
don't
know.
we
do
have
in
the
record
that
in
1971
i
believe
there
were
some
$4
billion
in
personal
property
rendered
in
the
state
of
texas.
it
produced
taxes
of
500
million
or
so.
these
figures
are
at
page
68
and
69
of
the
appendix,
these
figures
are
part
of
the
stipulation.
so,
apparently,
someone
is
rendering
personal
property.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
just
--
again,
don't
know
--
i
think
it
varies
from
place
to
place.
there's
some
indications
in
some
areas
that
is
automobiles
are
taxed
and
others
they
are
not.
i
know
that
everywhere
i've
lived
in
texas,
i've
always
have
to
pay
a
tax
on
my
automobile.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
know
that
in
my
office
in
dallas
when
i
was
in
private
practice,
the
tax
assessor
used
to
come
through
the
office
and
list
every
table
and
chair
we
own.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
well,
that's
the
alternative.
if
you
don't
render
he
renders
for
you,
so
its
--
they're
rendered.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
would
think
that
would
be
considered
a
rendition.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know.
the
courts
have
not
spoken
to
that
but
that
is
considered
--
that
your
property
has
been
rendered.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
the
reason
i
don't
know
is
that
they
vary
from
tax
assessor
and
collector
to
tax
assessor
and
collector.
the
law
is
very
specific
that
everything
must
be
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
some
render,
some
go
out
and
very
precise
i
believe
in
listing
a
person's
property,
others
do
not.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
again,
it
can
be
the
county;
in
this
case
it's
a
city.
it
can
be
the
county,
it
can
be
a
school
district,
it
can
be
any
other
kind
of
a
special
district.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that's
correct.
whether
or
not
you
pay
taxes
or
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
it
doesn't
matter,
the
value
doesn't
matter.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that's
the
holding
of
our
supreme
court
in
the
montgomery
case.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
he
is
on
the
rolls.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
he'd
also
have
to
be
a
registered
voter,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
exactly.
if
i
may
quote
from
the
supreme
court
on
this
very
--
of
texas
on
this
very
point,
it
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
think
he
would
have
to
render
property
for
taxation.
everybody
knows
--
he
at
least
has
a
pair
of
pants.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that's
right
--
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
our
position
is
that
everybody
and
the
supreme
court
said
this
of
texas
said
that
everybody
has
property.
everybody
has
something
to
render
and
in
their
language
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
was
handy
against
holman
and
the
court
said,
that's
right,
they
want
to
render
$100.00
each
so
they
can
vote,
they
can
do
it
and
we
can't
challenge
that.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
we
have
multiple
taxing
authorities.
a
county
will
determine
the
right
taxation
for
county
taxes
or
city
taxes,
school
district
taxes,
junior
college
taxes,
hospital
district
taxes
and
so
on
and
each
one
will
determine
its
own
rate
within
certain
statutory
or
constitutional
limits.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
supreme
court
in
the
montgomery
case
said
and
i'm
quoting,
“it
is
the
contention
of
the
attorney
general
and
we
agree
that
voter
qualifications
of
ownership
under
the
texas
constitutional
and
statutory
provision
stated
above
as
interpreted
by
our
decisions
are
so
universal
as
to
constitute
no
impediment
to
any
elect
or
who
really
desires
to
vote
in
a
bond
election.
a
voter
is
qualified
if
he
renders
any
kind
of
property
of
any
value
and
he
need
not
have
actually
paid
the
tax.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
no,
i'm
sorry
case,
the
montgomery
case
in
464
s.w.
2d
at
page
640.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
he
files
--
he
signs
an
affidavit
that
he
has
rendered
at
least
one
piece
of
property
for
taxation
and
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
describes
that.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
statutes
require
that
all
property
be
rendered
for
state
county
taxes
for
tax
of
political
subdivision
and
so
on
and
that
those
who
have
duly
rendered
taxation
are
qualified
to
vote.
these
provisions
are
attacked
by
the
appellees
as
being
unconstitutional
as
invidiously
discriminating
against
a
class,
namely
the
class
of
all
those
who
fail
to
render
their
property
for
taxation
even
though
our
statutes
require
that
they
do
render
their
property.
it's
attacked
by
another
group
of
appellees
who
rendered
their
property
but
who
now
assert
that
because
--
who
assert
that
rendering
taxpayers
are
given
a
veto
in
effect.
in
reynolds
against
sims,
this
court
made
it
clear
that
classifications
of
those
entitled
vote
based
on
race,
sex,
economic
status
or
place
of
residence
were
invidiously
discriminatory
and
would
fall.
there
is
no
justification
constitutionally
for
those
classifications
but
the
classification
if
there
is
one
under
our
texas
constitution
and
statutes
is
a
classification
of
those
who
obey
the
law
and
render
their
personal
property
for
taxation,
whether
they
pay
or
not.
surely,
that
classification
having
nothing
to
do
with
race
or
sex
or
economic
status
or
place
of
residence
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes
sir,
if
he
renders
at
all.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
not
for
these
purposes.
again,
i'm
sure
varies
from
district
to
district,
the
law
requires
a
complete
return
and
he
fails
to
file
one
and
if
it's
the
policy
of
the
district
to
enforce
the
law
in
that
respect,
he
would
be
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
some
other
statute.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
no
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
record
doesn't
show
that
there
is
a
single
person
who
did
not
file
a
return.
the
record
is
absolutely
silent
on
that.
we
don't
know
that
there
is
a
person
who
was
eligible
to
vote
in
this
election
who
did
not
file
a
return.
we
know
that
there
are
people
who
voted
as
not
having
filed
returns.
but
we
don't
know
that
there's
a
single
person
who
did
not
nor
do
we
know
where
there's
a
single
person
who
cannot
file
a
return.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
if
he
were
challenged,
i
assume
they
would
for
it
but
i
know
no
instance
was
on
here
as
we
know
it.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
correct.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes
sir.
money
in
the
bank
is
subject
to
rendition.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
guess
cash
in
your
pocket
and
shoes
on
your
feet,
watch
on
your
arm.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
$250.00
for
household,
goods
and
furniture.
so
your
watch
is
not
exempted
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
no
exemption
for
clothing,
household
goods
and
furnishings
for
$250.00.
the
truth
that
matter,
well,
in
reynolds
against
sims,
this
court
said,
so
long
as
the
divergence
is
from
a
strict
population
standard
are
based
on
legitimate
considerations
incident
to
the
effectuation
of
a
rational
state
policy,
some
deviations
from
the
equal
population
principle
are
constitutionally
permissible.
the
truth
of
matter
is
that
our
statutes
deny
the
right
to
vote
on
a
bond
election
to
no
one,
rich,
poor,
black,
brown,
white
or
for
any
other
reason.
everyone
own
some
property
subject
to
rendition.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
is
anyone
who
cannot
meet
the
qualification
to
vote,
who
cannot
render.
there
are
many
many
people
who
do
not
render
their
property
for
one
reason
or
another
personal
to
them
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
there
is
anyone
in
the
city
of
fort
worth
who
could
not
have
rendered
property
and
who
could
not
have
qualified
to
vote.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
if
there
is
such
a
person
in
fort
worth
that
he
could
not
render,
if
he
absolutely
would
start
naked
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
render
it.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that's
correct,
they
said
that
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
correct
your
honor.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
oh!
no,
you
can
--
by
statute
you
can
render
from
january
1st
to
april
30th.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
by
statute
and
i'm
sure
--
and
i
think
you
can
even
render
after
that.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
the
current
year's
taxes
are
rendered
between
january
1st
and
april
30th.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
january
1st.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
well,
its
property
owned
as
of
january
1st
as
the
determinative
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
is
a
rendering,
yes
sir.
you
would
not
pay
any
taxes
on
it.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
believe
so,
yes
sir.
you
have
rendered
your
personal
property.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that
also
is
rendered.
you
have
to
render
it
to
claim
a
home
state.
you
only
claim
the
home
state
when
you
render
it.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
oh!
yes,
sir.
there's
the
whole
section
of
the
--
in
our
statute
having
to
do
with
the
rendition
of
personal
properties
starting
with
article
7150
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
statutes
are
very
specific.
article
7162
has
some
list
some
42
different
things
which
must
be
rendered.
and
then
it
concludes
with
section
43,
the
valuable
other
property
not
enumerated
above,
so
i
don't
know
of
anything
that
doesn't
catch
and
its
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
the
number
of
goats
and
value
thereof
and
so
on,
i
mean
it's
that
specific.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i'm
sorry
but
i
don't
know.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
have
--
no,
i
have
not.
i
have
not
lived
--
i've
had
personal
property
rendered
by
the
taxing
authority
for
me
but
i've
never
gone
down
and
filled
out
a
form
where
i
rendered.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
you
mean
whether
it's
technical
--
correct
as
to
value
or
as
to
what
property.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i'm
sure
it
is
not.
i'm
sure
it
is
not
complete
as
to
my
holding.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
it
is
uniform
that
whatever
the
practice
is
that
is
uniform
and
equal
within
a
particular
taxing
authority.
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
anybody
who
wants
to
vote
in
one
of
these
bond
elections,
if
he
wishes
may
go
down
and
render
any
amount
of
property
for
taxation,
he
does
not
need
to
pay
a
tax
on
it
but
he
has
to
have
some
property
rendered.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
think
that
--
although
i
think
there
is
a
certain
rationality
in
this
although
it
does
--
not
as
it
applies
to
everyone
but
the
theory
behind
this
i'm
sure
is
that
if
you're
going
to
build
a
$6,000,000.00
--
$6,860.000.00
library
and
pay
for
it
by
taxes
levied
against
rendered
property
and
that's
the
only
way
its
going
to
be
paid
for,
its
not
subject
to
payment
out
of
other
taxes
and
if
you
don't
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
the
only
statistics
in
this
record
as
to
vote
is
on
these
two
issues
which
were
involved
in
the
election
in
question.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
all
votes
are
counted,
they're
given
different
effects.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
those
who
have
rendered
are
counted
and
the
bond
issue
carries
only
if
they
--
a
majority
of
them
and
the
majority
of
all
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
now
this
is
--
there
is
no
statute
that
provides
this
method
of
voting,
this
is
something
which
the
attorney
general's
predecessor
devised
as
a
means
to
assure
that
we
can
continue
to
have
bond
elections
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
right.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
1that's
right,
and
in
this
instance
the
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
and
the
library
issue
failed.
it
got
a
majority
of
those
who
did
not
render
but
it
did
not
get
a
majority
of
those
who
did
render.
i
mean
issues
submitted
to
those
who
rendered
was
or
to
all
of
them
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
the
exact
vote
on
the
library
issue
of
those
who
rendered,
10,000
or
11,000
voted
for
and
12,000
voted
against.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
of
those
who
rendered
is
11
to
12.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
right.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
on
the
nonrenderers,
it
was
3,700
for
and
1,100
against.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
4,800
and
it's
about
3
to
1.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
right.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
they
violated
the
law
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
and
what
was
violated?
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
by
not
rendering?
that
again
is
up
to
the
local
taxing
authorities
as
to
what
they
will
do
if
anything
and
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
have
not
found
any.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
probably.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
well,
of
course
one
reason
for
rendering
would
be
if
you'd
like
to
vote
in
this
type
of
election,
that's
one
reason.
another
is
that
i
think
you
probably
understand
more
of
an
obligation
to
render
absolutely
everything
if
you
do
it
yourself
because
you
have
to
render
under
oath
and
state
that
that
is
all
the
property
you
have.
where
as
if
you
leave
it
up
to
the
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
well,
the
assessor
for
instance
goes
to
the
automobile
license
rolls
and
he
--
and
every
county
i've
lived
in
and
i
get
a
tax
bill
for
my
automobile,
a
property
tax
bill
on
my
cars
where
he
has
rendered
them
for
me
but
he
doesn't
--
except
in
my
business,
he
doesn't
come
to
my
home
and
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
because
i
think
most
people
i
know
don't
render
their
homes,
their
surely
taxed.
but
the
only
time
that
you
don't
have
the
right
is
that
if
you
feel
that
they've
been
unjustly
valued
and
you
get
on
the
board
of
equalization
and
complain
about
it,
but
otherwise
you
just
--
you
get
a
notice
that
they've
rendered
it
a
certain
figure
and
you
accept
it.
the
cases
upon
which
the
appellees
rely,
i
think
they're
easily
distinguishable,
first
is
kramer,
the
kramer
case,
in
that
case
involved
an
election
of
a
board,
a
school
board
and
the
decision
was
essentially
to
enforce
the
one
man,
one
vote
rule
in
the
absence
of
some
compelling
state
interest
to
deny
the
franchise
to
all
bona
fide
residents.
then
chief
justice
warren
declined
to
express
an
opinion
as
to
whether
the
state
in
some
circumstances
lighten
them
if
they
exercise
the
franchise
to
those
primarily
interested
or
primarily
affected
because
there,
he
found
everybody
was
equally
interested
in
the
practice.
in
a
dissent
written
by
justice
stewart,
it
was
said
that
they
were
unable
to
see
any
distinction
between
permissible
limitations
and
those
imposed
in
the
kramer
case
and
mr.
justice
stewart
went
on
to
say
and
i'm
quoting,
“so
long
as
the
classification
is
rationally
related
to
a
permissible
legislative
end,
therefore
as
our
residents,
literacy
and
age
requirements
oppose
with
respect
to
voting,
there
is
no
general
denial
of
equal
protection.
the
cipriano
case
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i
think
i
have
if
the
court
please.
i
would
like
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
point
and
that
is
that
this
election
is
not
a
vote
on
whether
or
not
to
build
the
library,
it's
a
vote
on
whether
this
is
how
it
be
financed.
the
city
council
determines
where
the
library
is
built.
the
city
council
may
build
it
with
funds
from
the
federal
government,
from
some
foundation
or
from
other
sources.
the
question
here
is
whether
these
people
who
rendered
property
maybe
those
who
are
entitled
to
vote
on
whether
that's
the
financing
to
be
used
for
the
library.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
if
i
may
just
take
a
minute
or
two.
i
think
that
there
is
one
other
source
mr.
justice
powell,
there
is
a
revenue
sharing
which
has
furnished
funds
for
great
many
improvements
in
the
state
of
texas
but
i
don't
that
necessarily
governs.
i
think
really
--
i
started
out
stating
our
position
in
this
and
mr.
gladden
hasn't
answered
it
yet
and
i
don't
think
he
can
because
of
the
decision
in
montgomery
case
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
class.
there
is
no
class
being
discriminated
against.
everybody
in
texas
qualifies
to
be
a
--
to
render
property
for
taxation.
they
may
or
they
may
not
choose
to
do
so.
i
take
issue
with
what
mr.
gladden
said
about
nobody
in
--
at
the
town
county
renders,
i
don't
know
where
he
gets
that,
that's
not
certainly
in
the
record.
in
the
handy
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
the
fact
were
the
40
taxpayers
rendered
a
$100.00
so
that
they
could
vote
in
an
election.
so
that's
a
possibility
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
what?
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
go
down
to
the
tax
assessor
and
collector's
office
and
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
yes
sir,
very
definitely.
the
statistics
in
the
record
showed
that
of
there
property
tax
in
some
--
they
have
a
total
of
about
a
$1,
400,000.00
on
their
ad
valorem
tax
rolls,
of
that
$352,000.00,
i'm
sorry
$352
million
is
personal
property
that's
subject
to
taxation
in
tarrant
county
in
fort
worth.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
no,
homes
have
come
as
ad
valorem
on
the
real
property
but
i
don't
know
what
its
comprised
of,
it
can
be
anything
but
real
property
and
the
record
is
silent
as
to
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
automobiles
and
boats,
it
could
be
fur
coats,
it
could
be
bank
deposits
and
securities
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
cadillac,
isn't
it?
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
oh!
i
don't
know
where
he
--
that
comes
from
because
certainly
not
from
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
not
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
people
in
fort
worth
--
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
sometimes
i
suspect
that
maybe
they
do
something
like
but
they
--
as
i
understand
the
rendition
as
i
speak
of
it
here,
it
is
either
going
to
the
assessor
and
collector's
office
or
having
him
come
to
yours
--
your
home,
your
office
or
wherever
and
you
submit
a
list
of
your
property
for
taxation
or
if
you
don't
submit
one,
he
submit
one
--
he
submits
one
for
you.
now,
mr.
gladden
mentioned,
i
don't
know
what
its
importance
is
that
this
is
the
only
library
fort
worth
had
and
the
record
is
silent
but
in
the
brief
submitted
by
the
city
attorney
for
the
city
of
fort
worth
that
said,
that
the
library
district
being
for
the
sole
purpose
of
constructing
a
new
central
library
in
addition
to
the
present
seven
branch
libraries
and
the
existing
central
downtown
library.
so,
the
question
here
was
whether
this
is
the
way
we're
going
to
financed
them
and
the
city
council
even
if
this
bond
issue
passed,
if
the
voters
hadn't
voted
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
a
bond
issue
to
build
a
library,
there's
no
--there's
nothing
to
compel
the
city
council
to
go
forward
with
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
close
rising
prices
we
find
very
often
will
pass
a
bond
issue
to
build
a
new
public
building
and
we
knew
we
get
around
to
build
it
finally,
the
bond
issue
wasn't
enough.
mr.
david
m.
kendall,
jr.
it
authorizes
--
they
may
find
they
can't
sell
the
bonds.
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
can
come
between
this
election
and
the
building
of
the
building.
in
--
i
want
to
point
out
if
i
may,
in
montgomery
involved
another
section
of
the
constitution
also
which
specifically
referred
to
taxpaying
voters
and
nevertheless,
they
said
they
did
not
have
to
pay
taxes
to
qualify
as
voters.
thank
you
very
much.
