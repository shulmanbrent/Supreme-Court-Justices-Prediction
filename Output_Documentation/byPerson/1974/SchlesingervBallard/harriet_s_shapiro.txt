ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
by
the
government
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
court
enjoined
the
navy's
discharge
of
lieutenant
ballard
and
declared
the
statute
requiring
his
discharge
unconstitutional.
lieutenant
ballard
claims
and
the
court
below
found
that
the
navy's
basic
separation
statute
discriminates
against
men
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that
statute
requires
lieutenant
ballard's
discharge
because
he
was
twice
passed
over
for
promotion.
although
he
had
less
than
10
full
years
of
commissioned
service.
a
special
statute
applicable
to
certain
woman
lieutenants
provides
for
their
discharge
after
13
years
of
service
if
they're
not
selected
for
promotion.
this
three
year
difference
is
the
basis
of
the
claim
of
discrimination.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
in
the
first
that
the
different
treatment
doesn't
turn
simply
on
sex.
in
the
course,
where
woman
and
man
fill
substantially
the
same
types
of
jobs,
for
instance,
the
judge
advocate
general
core,
the
medical
core
and
the
dental
core
all
officers
are
subject
to
the
basic
statute
requiring
separation
if
they
are
twice
passed
over
for
promotion.
similarly
nurses
men
and
women
are
subject
to
a
13
years
statute
similar
to
the
one
that
applies
to
the
line
lieutenant.
the
special
13
years
statute
applies
to
women
line
lieutenants
and
certain
staff
women.
these
women
are
competing
for
jobs
against
men
line
lieutenants
but
the
statute
provides
that
women
may
not
serve
on
naval
vessels
except
hospital
ships
and
transport
ships.
therefore,
the
jobs
that
the
women
are
subject
to
a
special
statute
made
fill
are
significantly
different
than
the
jobs
that
are
--
many
of
the
jobs
that
are
filled
by
the
men
line
lieutenants.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
i
believe
that
is
not
basically
in
this
case.
both
the
special
13
years
statute
and
the
basic
statute
providing
for
a
separation
after
being
twice
passed
over
reflect
the
special
military
philosophy.
in
civilian
life,
if
you
are
reasonably
good
at
your
job
you
can
normally
expect
to
keep
it
even
if
you're
not
promoted
but
in
the
military
that
sort
of
competence
is
not
enough.
in
this
instead,
in
the
military
every
officer
is
periodically
compared
with
his
peers.
those
best
qualified
are
promoted,
the
others
are
separated.
this
is
a
very
tough
system
but
it
was
developed
after
world
war
2
to
meet
the
special
military
need
to
have
the
best
possible
officers
available
for
command.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there
are
limited
service
officers,
limited
duty
officers
who
are
not
eligible
for
command
at
sea.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
not
necessarily,
they
can
serve
on
board
ships
but
they
can't
command
ships.
on
the
other
hand
woman
can't
serve
on
board
ships
at
all
except
possibility
of
transport
ships,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
as
a
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
as
a
practical
matter
i'm
not
sure
that
the
navy
would
have
felt
nearly
as
upset
about
it
for
one
thing,
the
navy
has
proposed
to
congress
that
the
special
6401
statute
is
no
longer
necessary
in
light
of
current
conditions.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
not
by
very
much
but
slightly.
lieutenant
ballard
claims
that
he
is
not
challenging
these
basic
up
or
out
procedures
but
in
attacking
the
navy's
authority
to
discharge
him
after
he
has
been
passed
over
twice,
he
is
attacking
the
procedures
since
prompt
separation
is
important
to
the
effective
functioning
of
the
procedures.
and
this
is
no
less
true
because
a
different
rule
applies
to
a
particular
small
group
of
officers
whose
special
circumstances
justify
this
different
treatment.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
the
up
or
out
rule
does
apply
to
certain
women
and
it
applies,
the
up
or
out
right
rule
does
apply
to
women
the
only
difference
is
that
out
doesn't
occur
after
two
pass
over
it
occurs
after
13
years.
it's
basically
the
same
situation
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
the
out
rule
applies
to
women,
it
just
doesn't
apply
as
rapidly
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
pardon?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
there
are
several
reasons,
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
the
women
are
affected
by
it
are
relative
small
group,
they
are
at
a
disadvantage
in
competing
with
men
in
the
group
for
sea
jobs.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
it's
brought
about
by
the
statute
which
prohibits
them
from
serving
on
ships,
on
combat
ships.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
that's
true
but
the
--
let's
say
i
don't
believe
that
the
statute
prohibiting
women
from
serving
on
combat
ships
is
really
in
this
case.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
you
could.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah,
well
congress
says
that
women
shall
not
be
discharged
until
after
13
years
of
service,
if
they're
not
on
a
promotion
list.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
you
mean
why
doesn't
the
navy
say
that?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
congress
has
said
that
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
don't
believe
the
navy
could
say
that
in
light
of
the
current
statutes,
congress
could
say
that.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
because
section
63
a
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
problem
in
the
case
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
6382
a
provides
that;
male
officers
and
women
–
well,
it
actually
provides
that
all
officers
except
women
appointed
under
section
5590.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--
must
be
separated
after
they
have
twice
failed
of
selection.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no
that's,
that
just
way
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
correct.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
exactly.
the
basic
procedures
are
those
designed
by
congress
to
assure
the
selection
of
the
best
qualified
officers
for
military
command.
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
congressional
choice
that
is
entitled
to
great
difference
since
it
is
so
closely
related
to
the
navy's
ability
to
fight
effectively.
the
basic
rule
requiring
the
separation
of
officers
who've
been
twice
passed
over
for
promotion
is
not
as
the
court
below
believed
basically
a
fiscal
or
administrative
provision.
instead,
it's
a
means
of
assuring
a
high
quality
of
the
pool
from
which
eligible
officers
are
chosen.
all
officers
eligible
for
promotion
are
annually
evaluated
against
their
peers.
the
best
are
promoted
but
the
quality
of
the
pool
from
which
future
officers
must
be
selected
must
also
be
protected.
therefore,
those
officers
who
have
served
long
enough
to
show
that
they
are
not
qualified
for
promotion
must
be
witted
out.
in
that
way,
there's
additional
space
in
the
pool
for
new
officers
to
enter.
they
replace
not
only
the
best
but
also
the
least
qualified.
in
other
words,
the
effect
of
the
two
passover
procedure
or
the
prompt
separation
of
those
not
selected
for
promotion
is
that
you
don't
just
skim
the
cream
off
the
eligible
pool
but
you
also
take
off
the
bottom
layer
so
that
the
quality
of
the
pool
remains
constant.
congress
has
defined
a
point
at
which
this
witting
out
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
approximately
15%
to
30%,
the
promotion
rate
is
about
85%
--
70%
to
85%.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
pardon?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
but
yeah,
this
is
from
lieutenant
to
lieutenant
commander.
the
point
of
which
the
witting
occurs
is
defined
in
two
different
ways.
the
basic
provision
applies
to
most
officers
including
unrestricted
line
officers
and
to
men
and
women
in
most
of
this
stay
of
course.
it
requires
separation
after
the
officer
has
been
twice
passed
over.
that's
not
a
statute
that
operates
as
the
district
court
believed
on
the
turn
of
the
calendar.
the
determination
of
women
officers
has
been
passed
over
involves
the
exercise
a
very
substantial
military
judgment.
since
being
passed
over
does
not
mean
simply
that
an
officer
was
eligible
for
promotion
but
was
not
selected.
instead
it
means
that
he
served
long
enough
so
that
the
fact
that
he
is
not
selected
should
be
counted
against
him.
the
determination
of
when
that
point
occurs
is
a
very
complex
one.
it
requires
balancing
the
very
needs
of
the
service
for
officers.
the
manpower
needs
from
year
to
year
and
the
desirability
of
having
a
large
enough
group
from
which
to
select
the
officers
against
the
need
to
treat
the
people
equally
from
year
to
year.
there
really
are
two
important
points
in
this
procedure
as
the
need
for
combat
officers
increases
in
national
emergencies,
the
length
of
service
before
promotion
decreases.
that
length
is
currently
about
9
years
as
opposed
to
peacetime
goal
of
12
years.
secondly,
the
increased
need
for
officers
places
a
heaver
drain
on
the
pool
of
officers
eligible
for
promotion
and
makes
it
increasingly
important
to
assure
the
high
quality
of
the
pool.
one
way
of
doing
that
is
by
the
prompt
separation
of
those
passed
over,
since
the
current
promotion
rate
is
70%
to
85%
those
who
like
lieutenant
ballard
are
passed
over
twice
are
less
qualified
on
70%
to
85%
of
their
peers.
their
separation
improves
the
quality
of
the
pool
by
making
spaces
in
the
pool
available
to
others
who
have
not
yet
been
evaluated.
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
is
to
delay
the
separation
of
these
least
qualified
officers
for
about
three
years.
since
about
200
lieutenants
subject
to
the
basic
rule
are
passed
over
for
the
second
time
each
year.
the
potential
effect
of
the
decision
under
current
conditions
would
be
that
about
600
such
officers
would
have
to
be
retained
in
the
pool
of
eligible
lieutenants.
that
means
again
that
about
1900
officers
in
the
lower
grades
who've
not
been
evaluated
would
have
to
be
separated.
of
course,
if
the
conditions
change
so
that
the
length,
the
normal
length
of
service
is
shorter
or
that
the
promotion
rates
drop
then
the
number
of
officers
in
the
deleterious
effect
on
the
pool
would
be
increased.
in
any
event
the
pool
of
eligible
officers
is
permanently
degraded
and
the
caliber
of
officers
at
all
higher
levels
inevitably
suffers.
the
13
year
rule
which
is
as
i
have
noted,
applicable
to
certain
woman
officers
was
intended
to
provide
for
them
lengths
of
service,
roughly
equivalent
to
those
anticipated
for
the
vast
majority
of
officers
under
peacetime
conditions.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
lieutenants
and
yes,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i'm
talking
about
lieutenants,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
navy
lieutenant
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there
are
less
women
lieutenant
commanders.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
ratio
is
lower.
the
13
year
rule
does
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
basic
system.
since
it
requires
the
retention
of
a
few
officers
who
would
other
wise
be
separated.
but
the
effect
is
not
as
serious
in
the
female
line
officer
category
as
it
would
be
if
it
were
applied
to
all
naval
lieutenants
now
subject
to
the
basic
rule.
first,
the
absolute
numbers
involved
are
far
smaller.
in
1972
the
year
in
which
lieutenant
ballard
was
passed
over
for
the
second
time
14
women
officers
were
held
over
simply
because
of
the
special
13
year
statute.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
passed
over
twice,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
that's
right.
and
in
comparison
238
male
lieutenants
were
passed
over
for
the
second
time
except
for
a
few
of
those
who
were
retained
because
they
were
close
to
retirement
or
separated
out.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
the
normal
peacetime.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
a
statute
process
that
the
normal
length
of
service
should
be
12
years
and
this
is
the
peacetime
goal.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
eligibility
statute
has
been
suspended
by
the
executive
order.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
lieutenant
ballard,
the
real,
i
think
the
real
reason
of
lieutenant
ballard
is
so
anxious
to
remain
in
service
is
because
he
was
--
did
have
a
listed
service.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
they
don't.
on
the
other
hand,
their
selection
out
procedures
are
somewhat
different
because
both
the
army
and
the
air
force
operate
on
a
two
level
system,
that
is
that
you
are
promoted
in
temporary
grades
and
if
you're
selected
out
in
the
temporary
grade
then
you
revert
to
the
permanent
grade
and
you're
not
separated
until
you
have
been
passed
over
in
the
permanent
grade.
so
that
you
--
if
lieutenant
ballard
were
in
the
army
or
the
air
force,
he
would
still
be
in
service,
he
would
revert
to
his
permanent
grade
rather
than
to
his
temporary
grade.
there
are
justifications
for
permitting
these
female
officers
to
serve
a
few
years
longer
than
their
male
counterparts
who
have
been
twice
passed
over.
first,
the
special
13
year
rule
permits
the
retention
for
a
few
years
of
women
who
would
otherwise
be
separated.
it
thus
helps
to
improve
the
proportion
of
women
officers
in
the
navy.
since
there
are
over
20
times
as
many
male
officers
as
female
officers,
this
serves
a
reasonable
legislative
purpose.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
this
at
least,
this
is
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
i'm
not
sure
if
that
would
be
a
wise
policy.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
well,
as
far
as
the
navy's
goals
perhaps
the
other
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah.
that's
right,
that
would
solve
that
problem
but--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
other
justification
relates
to
considerations
of
fairness
to
the
woman
involved.
they've
--
promotion
rates
for
women
have
been
significantly
slower
than
for
men
and
promotion
opportunities
more
limited.
this
was
the
case
until
certainly
until
1967.
at
that
time
many
of
the
statutory
restraints
applicable
to
women
were
removed.
the
navy
has
since
then
speared
up
promotions
for
woman,
and
finally
in
1972,
the
length
of
service
before
promotion
of
woman
line
lieutenants
equal
those
of
their
male
counterparts
for
the
very
first
time.
nevertheless,
the
records
of
the
woman
who
are
being
retained
in
1972
because
of
the
13
year
provisions
were
made
while
the
slower
rates
prevailed.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
statute
was
designed
to
be
equivalent
to
the
peacetime
goals
for
men.
the
actual
length
of
service
for
men
at
that
time
was
about
the
same
as
it
is
now.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
that
the
title
10
includes
when
it
was
caught
upon
in
1947,
it
included
one
section
that
was
--
permanent
design,
the
permanent
peacetime
military
provisions
and
then
there
are
other
sections
that
are
temporary
national
emergency
sections,
the
permanent
provisions
have
never
come
into
effect,
they
come
into
effect
when
there
are
no
more
reserves
in
the
military.
finally,
the
women
subject
to
the
13
year
provision
still
suffer
a
disadvantage
in
competition
with
the
men
for
the
available
jobs
in
the
line
category.
about
40%
of
all
the
jobs
in
that
category
involve
ship
board
duty
and
women
by
statute
can't
fill
these
jobs.
more
over,
they
compete
for
the
jobs
for
which
they
are
qualified
with
men
and
in
that
competition,
they're
disadvantaged
because
their
records
reflect
the
lack
of
seaboard
duty.
and
the
13
year
rule
serves
to
counteract
these
disadvantages
to
some
extent
by
giving
the
women
somewhat
more
job
security.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
navy
has
concluded
that
the
13
year
rule
for
woman
is
no
longer
necessary
since
promotion
rates
are
now
equal.
and
therefore,
they
have
suggested
to
the
congress
that
the
special
in
6401
be
eliminated
as
part
of
the
overall
revision
of
the
military
promotion
and
separation
provisions
which
are
currently
before
congress.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
until
1967,
the
highest
rank
that
a
woman
could
have
i
believe
was
captain.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
as
a
matter
of
statute.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
no
longer
true.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
the
only
limitations.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
that's
right,
and
of
course,
there
is
this
limitation
on
service.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
hearings
were
held
on
it
over
the
summer,
it's
part
of
a
overall
provision,
an
overall
revision
of
the
entire
military
promotion
and
retirement
provisions.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
all
services.
nevertheless,
the
difference
in
treatment
of
which
lieutenant
ballard
complains
may
no
longer
be
necessary
and
it
may
soon
be
eliminated
as
a
matter
of
legislative
judgment.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it's
probably
not
this
here.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no
the
14
year
--
the
14th
figure,
no,
that
includes
only
the
women
that
are
subject
to
this
special
provision.
and
it
doesn't
the
nurse
core
which
has
got
another
13
year
provision.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
medical
core
the
women
are
subject
to
the
same
two
pass
over
role.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
not
very
man
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
commissioned
officer
nurses,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
if
there
no
further
question,
i
will
reserve
the
time
i
have?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
is
the
policy
but
this
is
certainly
a
special
situation.
the
only
reason
that
he
is
still
in
service
is
because
the
navy
has
been
enjoined
from
discharging
him
and
that
is
not
the
same
kind
of
the
situation
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
injunction
was
properly
issued
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
not
made
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
is
waiting
to
see
how
this
case
comes
out.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
injunction
against
discharging
him
i
believe
is
based
on
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
was
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah!
there's
a
permanent
injunction
that
we
are
under
and
the
reason
for
the
injunction
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes
there
was.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
secretary
of
the
navy
hasn't
decided.
he
doesn't
and
he
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
true.
yeah!
oh!
yes.
that's
his
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
we
can't
discharge
him
until
--
for
13
years.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
we
have
to
hold
him
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
we
would
hope
that
if
the
court
found
that
there
was
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
--
we
would
have
--
the
relief
would
indicate
that
if
the
special
statute
were
repealed,
why?
he
wouldn't
have
to
be
kept
for
the
13
years
that
you
know
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
only
other
point,
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
the
class
actions
that
mr.
khoury
referred
to
are
pending
in
the
district
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
under
injunctions
prohibiting
the
discharge
of
the
people
that
are
involved
in
those
cases.
lieutenant
ballard
would
have
been
discharged
in
june
of
1972.
there's
one
case
involving
lieutenants
who
would've
been
just
discharged
in
june
of
1973
and
the
other
in
june
of
1974
and
those
cases
are
being
held
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
by
the
government
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
court
enjoined
the
navy's
discharge
of
lieutenant
ballard
and
declared
the
statute
requiring
his
discharge
unconstitutional.
lieutenant
ballard
claims
and
the
court
below
found
that
the
navy's
basic
separation
statute
discriminates
against
men
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that
statute
requires
lieutenant
ballard's
discharge
because
he
was
twice
passed
over
for
promotion.
although
he
had
less
than
10
full
years
of
commissioned
service.
a
special
statute
applicable
to
certain
woman
lieutenants
provides
for
their
discharge
after
13
years
of
service
if
they're
not
selected
for
promotion.
this
three
year
difference
is
the
basis
of
the
claim
of
discrimination.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
in
the
first
that
the
different
treatment
doesn't
turn
simply
on
sex.
in
the
course,
where
woman
and
man
fill
substantially
the
same
types
of
jobs,
for
instance,
the
judge
advocate
general
core,
the
medical
core
and
the
dental
core
all
officers
are
subject
to
the
basic
statute
requiring
separation
if
they
are
twice
passed
over
for
promotion.
similarly
nurses
men
and
women
are
subject
to
a
13
years
statute
similar
to
the
one
that
applies
to
the
line
lieutenant.
the
special
13
years
statute
applies
to
women
line
lieutenants
and
certain
staff
women.
these
women
are
competing
for
jobs
against
men
line
lieutenants
but
the
statute
provides
that
women
may
not
serve
on
naval
vessels
except
hospital
ships
and
transport
ships.
therefore,
the
jobs
that
the
women
are
subject
to
a
special
statute
made
fill
are
significantly
different
than
the
jobs
that
are
--
many
of
the
jobs
that
are
filled
by
the
men
line
lieutenants.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
i
believe
that
is
not
basically
in
this
case.
both
the
special
13
years
statute
and
the
basic
statute
providing
for
a
separation
after
being
twice
passed
over
reflect
the
special
military
philosophy.
in
civilian
life,
if
you
are
reasonably
good
at
your
job
you
can
normally
expect
to
keep
it
even
if
you're
not
promoted
but
in
the
military
that
sort
of
competence
is
not
enough.
in
this
instead,
in
the
military
every
officer
is
periodically
compared
with
his
peers.
those
best
qualified
are
promoted,
the
others
are
separated.
this
is
a
very
tough
system
but
it
was
developed
after
world
war
2
to
meet
the
special
military
need
to
have
the
best
possible
officers
available
for
command.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there
are
limited
service
officers,
limited
duty
officers
who
are
not
eligible
for
command
at
sea.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
not
necessarily,
they
can
serve
on
board
ships
but
they
can't
command
ships.
on
the
other
hand
woman
can't
serve
on
board
ships
at
all
except
possibility
of
transport
ships,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
as
a
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
as
a
practical
matter
i'm
not
sure
that
the
navy
would
have
felt
nearly
as
upset
about
it
for
one
thing,
the
navy
has
proposed
to
congress
that
the
special
6401
statute
is
no
longer
necessary
in
light
of
current
conditions.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
not
by
very
much
but
slightly.
lieutenant
ballard
claims
that
he
is
not
challenging
these
basic
up
or
out
procedures
but
in
attacking
the
navy's
authority
to
discharge
him
after
he
has
been
passed
over
twice,
he
is
attacking
the
procedures
since
prompt
separation
is
important
to
the
effective
functioning
of
the
procedures.
and
this
is
no
less
true
because
a
different
rule
applies
to
a
particular
small
group
of
officers
whose
special
circumstances
justify
this
different
treatment.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
the
up
or
out
rule
does
apply
to
certain
women
and
it
applies,
the
up
or
out
right
rule
does
apply
to
women
the
only
difference
is
that
out
doesn't
occur
after
two
pass
over
it
occurs
after
13
years.
it's
basically
the
same
situation
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
the
out
rule
applies
to
women,
it
just
doesn't
apply
as
rapidly
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
pardon?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
there
are
several
reasons,
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
the
women
are
affected
by
it
are
relative
small
group,
they
are
at
a
disadvantage
in
competing
with
men
in
the
group
for
sea
jobs.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
it's
brought
about
by
the
statute
which
prohibits
them
from
serving
on
ships,
on
combat
ships.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
that's
true
but
the
--
let's
say
i
don't
believe
that
the
statute
prohibiting
women
from
serving
on
combat
ships
is
really
in
this
case.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
you
could.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah,
well
congress
says
that
women
shall
not
be
discharged
until
after
13
years
of
service,
if
they're
not
on
a
promotion
list.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
you
mean
why
doesn't
the
navy
say
that?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
congress
has
said
that
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
don't
believe
the
navy
could
say
that
in
light
of
the
current
statutes,
congress
could
say
that.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
because
section
63
a
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
problem
in
the
case
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
6382
a
provides
that;
male
officers
and
women
–
well,
it
actually
provides
that
all
officers
except
women
appointed
under
section
5590.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--
must
be
separated
after
they
have
twice
failed
of
selection.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no
that's,
that
just
way
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
correct.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
exactly.
the
basic
procedures
are
those
designed
by
congress
to
assure
the
selection
of
the
best
qualified
officers
for
military
command.
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
congressional
choice
that
is
entitled
to
great
difference
since
it
is
so
closely
related
to
the
navy's
ability
to
fight
effectively.
the
basic
rule
requiring
the
separation
of
officers
who've
been
twice
passed
over
for
promotion
is
not
as
the
court
below
believed
basically
a
fiscal
or
administrative
provision.
instead,
it's
a
means
of
assuring
a
high
quality
of
the
pool
from
which
eligible
officers
are
chosen.
all
officers
eligible
for
promotion
are
annually
evaluated
against
their
peers.
the
best
are
promoted
but
the
quality
of
the
pool
from
which
future
officers
must
be
selected
must
also
be
protected.
therefore,
those
officers
who
have
served
long
enough
to
show
that
they
are
not
qualified
for
promotion
must
be
witted
out.
in
that
way,
there's
additional
space
in
the
pool
for
new
officers
to
enter.
they
replace
not
only
the
best
but
also
the
least
qualified.
in
other
words,
the
effect
of
the
two
passover
procedure
or
the
prompt
separation
of
those
not
selected
for
promotion
is
that
you
don't
just
skim
the
cream
off
the
eligible
pool
but
you
also
take
off
the
bottom
layer
so
that
the
quality
of
the
pool
remains
constant.
congress
has
defined
a
point
at
which
this
witting
out
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
approximately
15%
to
30%,
the
promotion
rate
is
about
85%
--
70%
to
85%.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
pardon?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
but
yeah,
this
is
from
lieutenant
to
lieutenant
commander.
the
point
of
which
the
witting
occurs
is
defined
in
two
different
ways.
the
basic
provision
applies
to
most
officers
including
unrestricted
line
officers
and
to
men
and
women
in
most
of
this
stay
of
course.
it
requires
separation
after
the
officer
has
been
twice
passed
over.
that's
not
a
statute
that
operates
as
the
district
court
believed
on
the
turn
of
the
calendar.
the
determination
of
women
officers
has
been
passed
over
involves
the
exercise
a
very
substantial
military
judgment.
since
being
passed
over
does
not
mean
simply
that
an
officer
was
eligible
for
promotion
but
was
not
selected.
instead
it
means
that
he
served
long
enough
so
that
the
fact
that
he
is
not
selected
should
be
counted
against
him.
the
determination
of
when
that
point
occurs
is
a
very
complex
one.
it
requires
balancing
the
very
needs
of
the
service
for
officers.
the
manpower
needs
from
year
to
year
and
the
desirability
of
having
a
large
enough
group
from
which
to
select
the
officers
against
the
need
to
treat
the
people
equally
from
year
to
year.
there
really
are
two
important
points
in
this
procedure
as
the
need
for
combat
officers
increases
in
national
emergencies,
the
length
of
service
before
promotion
decreases.
that
length
is
currently
about
9
years
as
opposed
to
peacetime
goal
of
12
years.
secondly,
the
increased
need
for
officers
places
a
heaver
drain
on
the
pool
of
officers
eligible
for
promotion
and
makes
it
increasingly
important
to
assure
the
high
quality
of
the
pool.
one
way
of
doing
that
is
by
the
prompt
separation
of
those
passed
over,
since
the
current
promotion
rate
is
70%
to
85%
those
who
like
lieutenant
ballard
are
passed
over
twice
are
less
qualified
on
70%
to
85%
of
their
peers.
their
separation
improves
the
quality
of
the
pool
by
making
spaces
in
the
pool
available
to
others
who
have
not
yet
been
evaluated.
the
effect
of
the
decision
below
is
to
delay
the
separation
of
these
least
qualified
officers
for
about
three
years.
since
about
200
lieutenants
subject
to
the
basic
rule
are
passed
over
for
the
second
time
each
year.
the
potential
effect
of
the
decision
under
current
conditions
would
be
that
about
600
such
officers
would
have
to
be
retained
in
the
pool
of
eligible
lieutenants.
that
means
again
that
about
1900
officers
in
the
lower
grades
who've
not
been
evaluated
would
have
to
be
separated.
of
course,
if
the
conditions
change
so
that
the
length,
the
normal
length
of
service
is
shorter
or
that
the
promotion
rates
drop
then
the
number
of
officers
in
the
deleterious
effect
on
the
pool
would
be
increased.
in
any
event
the
pool
of
eligible
officers
is
permanently
degraded
and
the
caliber
of
officers
at
all
higher
levels
inevitably
suffers.
the
13
year
rule
which
is
as
i
have
noted,
applicable
to
certain
woman
officers
was
intended
to
provide
for
them
lengths
of
service,
roughly
equivalent
to
those
anticipated
for
the
vast
majority
of
officers
under
peacetime
conditions.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
lieutenants
and
yes,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i'm
talking
about
lieutenants,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
navy
lieutenant
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
there
are
less
women
lieutenant
commanders.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
ratio
is
lower.
the
13
year
rule
does
interfere
with
the
operation
of
the
basic
system.
since
it
requires
the
retention
of
a
few
officers
who
would
other
wise
be
separated.
but
the
effect
is
not
as
serious
in
the
female
line
officer
category
as
it
would
be
if
it
were
applied
to
all
naval
lieutenants
now
subject
to
the
basic
rule.
first,
the
absolute
numbers
involved
are
far
smaller.
in
1972
the
year
in
which
lieutenant
ballard
was
passed
over
for
the
second
time
14
women
officers
were
held
over
simply
because
of
the
special
13
year
statute.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
passed
over
twice,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
that's
right.
and
in
comparison
238
male
lieutenants
were
passed
over
for
the
second
time
except
for
a
few
of
those
who
were
retained
because
they
were
close
to
retirement
or
separated
out.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
the
normal
peacetime.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
a
statute
process
that
the
normal
length
of
service
should
be
12
years
and
this
is
the
peacetime
goal.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
eligibility
statute
has
been
suspended
by
the
executive
order.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
lieutenant
ballard,
the
real,
i
think
the
real
reason
of
lieutenant
ballard
is
so
anxious
to
remain
in
service
is
because
he
was
--
did
have
a
listed
service.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
they
don't.
on
the
other
hand,
their
selection
out
procedures
are
somewhat
different
because
both
the
army
and
the
air
force
operate
on
a
two
level
system,
that
is
that
you
are
promoted
in
temporary
grades
and
if
you're
selected
out
in
the
temporary
grade
then
you
revert
to
the
permanent
grade
and
you're
not
separated
until
you
have
been
passed
over
in
the
permanent
grade.
so
that
you
--
if
lieutenant
ballard
were
in
the
army
or
the
air
force,
he
would
still
be
in
service,
he
would
revert
to
his
permanent
grade
rather
than
to
his
temporary
grade.
there
are
justifications
for
permitting
these
female
officers
to
serve
a
few
years
longer
than
their
male
counterparts
who
have
been
twice
passed
over.
first,
the
special
13
year
rule
permits
the
retention
for
a
few
years
of
women
who
would
otherwise
be
separated.
it
thus
helps
to
improve
the
proportion
of
women
officers
in
the
navy.
since
there
are
over
20
times
as
many
male
officers
as
female
officers,
this
serves
a
reasonable
legislative
purpose.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
this
at
least,
this
is
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
i'm
not
sure
if
that
would
be
a
wise
policy.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
well,
as
far
as
the
navy's
goals
perhaps
the
other
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah.
that's
right,
that
would
solve
that
problem
but--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
other
justification
relates
to
considerations
of
fairness
to
the
woman
involved.
they've
--
promotion
rates
for
women
have
been
significantly
slower
than
for
men
and
promotion
opportunities
more
limited.
this
was
the
case
until
certainly
until
1967.
at
that
time
many
of
the
statutory
restraints
applicable
to
women
were
removed.
the
navy
has
since
then
speared
up
promotions
for
woman,
and
finally
in
1972,
the
length
of
service
before
promotion
of
woman
line
lieutenants
equal
those
of
their
male
counterparts
for
the
very
first
time.
nevertheless,
the
records
of
the
woman
who
are
being
retained
in
1972
because
of
the
13
year
provisions
were
made
while
the
slower
rates
prevailed.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
statute
was
designed
to
be
equivalent
to
the
peacetime
goals
for
men.
the
actual
length
of
service
for
men
at
that
time
was
about
the
same
as
it
is
now.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
that
the
title
10
includes
when
it
was
caught
upon
in
1947,
it
included
one
section
that
was
--
permanent
design,
the
permanent
peacetime
military
provisions
and
then
there
are
other
sections
that
are
temporary
national
emergency
sections,
the
permanent
provisions
have
never
come
into
effect,
they
come
into
effect
when
there
are
no
more
reserves
in
the
military.
finally,
the
women
subject
to
the
13
year
provision
still
suffer
a
disadvantage
in
competition
with
the
men
for
the
available
jobs
in
the
line
category.
about
40%
of
all
the
jobs
in
that
category
involve
ship
board
duty
and
women
by
statute
can't
fill
these
jobs.
more
over,
they
compete
for
the
jobs
for
which
they
are
qualified
with
men
and
in
that
competition,
they're
disadvantaged
because
their
records
reflect
the
lack
of
seaboard
duty.
and
the
13
year
rule
serves
to
counteract
these
disadvantages
to
some
extent
by
giving
the
women
somewhat
more
job
security.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
navy
has
concluded
that
the
13
year
rule
for
woman
is
no
longer
necessary
since
promotion
rates
are
now
equal.
and
therefore,
they
have
suggested
to
the
congress
that
the
special
in
6401
be
eliminated
as
part
of
the
overall
revision
of
the
military
promotion
and
separation
provisions
which
are
currently
before
congress.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
until
1967,
the
highest
rank
that
a
woman
could
have
i
believe
was
captain.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
as
a
matter
of
statute.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
no
longer
true.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
the
only
limitations.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
that's
right,
and
of
course,
there
is
this
limitation
on
service.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
hearings
were
held
on
it
over
the
summer,
it's
part
of
a
overall
provision,
an
overall
revision
of
the
entire
military
promotion
and
retirement
provisions.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
all
services.
nevertheless,
the
difference
in
treatment
of
which
lieutenant
ballard
complains
may
no
longer
be
necessary
and
it
may
soon
be
eliminated
as
a
matter
of
legislative
judgment.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it's
probably
not
this
here.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no
the
14
year
--
the
14th
figure,
no,
that
includes
only
the
women
that
are
subject
to
this
special
provision.
and
it
doesn't
the
nurse
core
which
has
got
another
13
year
provision.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
medical
core
the
women
are
subject
to
the
same
two
pass
over
role.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
not
very
man
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
commissioned
officer
nurses,
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
if
there
no
further
question,
i
will
reserve
the
time
i
have?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
is
the
policy
but
this
is
certainly
a
special
situation.
the
only
reason
that
he
is
still
in
service
is
because
the
navy
has
been
enjoined
from
discharging
him
and
that
is
not
the
same
kind
of
the
situation
if
this
court
should
decide
that
the
injunction
was
properly
issued
the
secretary
of
the
navy
has
not
made
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
is
waiting
to
see
how
this
case
comes
out.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
injunction
against
discharging
him
i
believe
is
based
on
the
conclusion
that
the
statute
was
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah!
there's
a
permanent
injunction
that
we
are
under
and
the
reason
for
the
injunction
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes
there
was.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
secretary
of
the
navy
hasn't
decided.
he
doesn't
and
he
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
true.
yeah!
oh!
yes.
that's
his
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
we
can't
discharge
him
until
--
for
13
years.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
we
have
to
hold
him
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yeah.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
we
would
hope
that
if
the
court
found
that
there
was
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
--
we
would
have
--
the
relief
would
indicate
that
if
the
special
statute
were
repealed,
why?
he
wouldn't
have
to
be
kept
for
the
13
years
that
you
know
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
only
other
point,
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
the
class
actions
that
mr.
khoury
referred
to
are
pending
in
the
district
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
under
injunctions
prohibiting
the
discharge
of
the
people
that
are
involved
in
those
cases.
lieutenant
ballard
would
have
been
discharged
in
june
of
1972.
there's
one
case
involving
lieutenants
who
would've
been
just
discharged
in
june
of
1973
and
the
other
in
june
of
1974
and
those
cases
are
being
held
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
