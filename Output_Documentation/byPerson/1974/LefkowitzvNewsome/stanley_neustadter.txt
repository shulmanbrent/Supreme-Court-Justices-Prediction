mr.
stanley
neustadter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hope
you
won't
think
it
overly
blunt
for
me
to
state
something
or
rather
firmly
at
the
outset,
i
think
a
reversal
here
would
require
this
court
to
put
a
revolutionary
gloss
on
a
very
stagy
concept
of
waiver.
the
petitioner,
although
he
hasn't
used
the
magic
word
waiver
is
essentially
asking
you
to
find
a
waiver
in
unprecedented
context,
a
context
unlike
all
other
cases
where
there
has
been
some
sort
of
default,
some
sort
of
lapse,
some
sort
of
relinquishment.
petitioner
is
asking
you
to
find
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
claim
in
this
case
and
the
opportunity
to
vindicate
that
claim
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
even
though
he
has
fully
litigated
that
claim
in
perfect
and
timely
accord
with
every
inch
and
paragraph
of
the
state
statue
and
it
seems
to
me
rather
anomalous
that
they
could
achieve
that
result.
the
petitioner
attributes
this
waiver
of
habeas
corpus
vindication
to
a
plea.
automatically,
he
is
saying
the
guilty
plea
dispatches
with
federal
habeas
remedies
and
this
is
the
same
guilty
plea
that
does
not
waive
under
the
state
law.
state
appellate
review
of
the
pre-plea
order
denying
the
motion
to
suppress.
it
is
the
same
guilty
plea
which
petitioner
conceded
to
page
13
of
his
brief
and
just
reiterate
the
concessions
from
mr.
justice
white,
does
not
waive
certiorari
prerogative,
yet
we're
told
that
the
same
plea
waives
the
mandatory
statute
--
statutory
relief
provided
by
congress
in
the
habeas
corpus
statue.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
the
states
can
always
be
more
generous,
in
terms
of
defining
the
perimeters
of
constitutional
rights
as
i'll
say
under
the
aegis
of
state
constitutions.
the
second
circuit
and
the
federal
court
in
the
second
circuit
jurisdiction
has
not
extended
or
enlarged
federal
jurisdiction
or
the
ambit
of
habeas
corpus
solely
for
new
york
petitioners.
that's
the
suggestion
in
petitioner's
brief
reiterated
again
here.
the
constant
for
habeas
corpus
relief
is
simply
that
the
constitutional
claim
be
presented
to
state
court
and
by
whatever
procedure
that
the
state
court
is
erected
for
that
purpose.
having
done
so
if
he
is
unsuccessful
and
if
he
finds
himself
in
custody
claiming
and
–
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
which
led
to
the
conviction,
he
has
met
the
threshold
jurisdictional
requirements
of
habeas
corpus
such
as
the
posture
of
my
client
when
he
came
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
correct.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
that
have
would
put
in
exactly
posture
of
this
case.
if
mr.
--
as
the
defendants
in
richardson
had
appeal,
in
other
words
had
813-c
existed
for
the
defendants
in
richardson
at
the
time
that
they
entered
they
plea,
had
they
litigated
their
confession
issue
in
the
pretrial
procedure
under
813-c,
had
they
then
pleaded
guilty,
pursue
their
appellate
remedies
as
allowed
by
813-c.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
and
pleaded
during
the
trial
under
state
law
at
that
time
state
appellate
review
of
that
confession
claim
would
have
been
thought.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
yes.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
he
does
not.
he
does
not
because
in
order
to
preserve
the
issue
in
pre
813-c
cases
such
as
mcmann
he
would
have
to
litigate
that
issue
at
trial.
if
he
pleads
he's
foregoing
the
possible
remedy
of
that
constitutional
claim
because
trial
in
a
none
813-c
context,
trial
is
the
only
way
to
litigate
that
issue
and
if
you
forgo
the
trial,
you
haven't
preserved,
there's
a
threshold
issue.
you
therefore
can't
seek
to
vindicate
it
on
appeal
within
state
court
and
you
therefore
bypass
the
orderly
procedures
which
the
state
has
erected
for
the
vindication
of
that
claim
and
you'll
no
longer
have
or
you
have
dispensed
with
your
prerogative
to
invoke
habeas
corpus
vindication.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
that
is
correct,
within
in
the
context
of
the
state
procedural
rule
which
setup
the
requirements
for
litigating
constitutional
claims.
there's
nothing
in
the
habeas
corpus
statue
that
requires
a
particular
format
of
procedures.
whatever
procedures
a
state
erects,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
mcmann,
it
was
the
hardest
case
possible
because
under
jackson
v.
denno,
the
procedures
that
were
allowed
were
held
to
be
unconstitutional
and
yet
in
mcmann
it
was
still
required
that
they
pursue
whatever
procedures
were
available
at
the
time
of
vindicating
that
confession
plan.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
not
only
that,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute
to
suggest
that
a
trial
as
opposed
to
a
plea
if
the
only
way
of
preserving
the
issue
for
subsequent
habeas
corpus
review.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
yes,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
--
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
no.
that's
perfectly
true,
that
would
be
the
sine
qua
non
of
any
habeas
petition
is
an
allegation
that
constitutional
violation
had
resulted
in
conviction.
the
only
point
i'm
making
with
respect
to
the
habeas
corpus
statute
at
this
time
is
that
the
other
basic
of
habeas
corpus
is
that
you
present
the
issue
to
state
court
for
possible
remedy
there,
that's
a
matter
of
comity.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
correct.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
pursue
your
appeal.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
correct,
exactly.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
oh,
yes.
well
it
wasn't
done
at
a
pretrial,
in
other
words
it
was
done
within
the
trial
itself
with
the
jury
sitting
there,
that
was
precisely
the
defect,
that
was
noted
in
jackson
v.
denno.
you
had
to
do
it
in
the
corpus
of
the
trial
itself
and
you
would
litigate
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
right
within
the
body
of
the
trial
which
is
why
if
you
pleaded
and
did
not
go
to
trial,
you're
obviously
abandoning
your
claim
of
coerced
confessions
because
that
was
the
only
way
to
litigate
it,
was
at
a
trial.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
there
was
never
really
that
bind
with
fourth
amendment
claims
for
the
simple
reasons
that
almost
immediately
after
mapp
came
down,
the
state
enacted
813-c.
so
you
never
had
a
time
lag,
however
there
was
a
--
mr.
stanley
neustadter
yes,
but
it
did
not
extent
to
confessions,
it
only
extended
to
physical
evidence
sought
to
be
suppressed
on
fourth
amendment
ground.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
of
course
not.
i
mean
that's
--
i
presume
why
we
are
all
here
today
to
resolve
that
footnote
in
mcmann
saying
we
do
not
pass
upon
that
issue.
i
would
lie
and
i
suppose
it's
somewhat
peculiar
to
have
both
petitioner
and
respondent
here
invoking
and
support
the
identical
cases.
we
both
really
relying
on
mcmann
and
tollet
although
for
rather
different
propositions.
i
read
mcmann
and
tollet
as
basing
habeas
corpus
availability
upon
the
preceding
context
of
state
procedures
and
weather
or
not
the
claim,
which
must
be
presented
in
the
first
instance
the
state
court
as
a
matter
of
comity
whether
that
claim
has
been
presented
in
accord
with
state
statutory
procedures.
in
mcmann,
the
only
way
to
do
it
was
at
trial.
the
plea
obviously
eliminated
trial.
the
defendants
in
mcmann
did
not
present
their
claim
at
the
court
with
state
statutory
procedures
in
mcmann,
and
they
could
not
thereafter
seek
to
overturn
the
tables
on
the
state
by
way
habeas
corpus.
they
did
not
give
the
state
the
opportunity
to
correct
their
own
errors
and
habeas
corpus
will
not
lie.
i
think
that
a
few
other
things
really
bear
mention
here.
yes?
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
he
got
in
at
the
appellate
term
level
in
this
case,
appellate
term
being
one
of
the
intermediate
appellate
courts
that
determines
misdemeanor
appeals.
under
--
i
forget
the
precise
statutory
section,
i
think
it's
71
of
the
executive
law
anytime
a
constitutionally
of
a
state
statue
is
involved
in
a
case
that
the
attorney
general
must
be
served
with
the
papers
and
at
his
election
may
intervene
and
of
course
at
no
point
in
the
state
proceedings
although
he
was
intervener,
we
give
him
the
slightest
wisp
of
a
signal
that
we
would
have
the
trap
door
slam
shot
on
us
if
we
marched
into
federal
court,
not
the
slightest
hint.
which
by
the
way
is
another
theme
that
i'd
like
to
pursue
on
this
case
because
there's
really
a
basic
unfairness
here,
parallel
to
the
unfairness
that
i
think
annoyed
this
court
in
cases
like
tollet
and
mcmann.
here
you
have
--
in
tollet
and
mcmann
you
had
a
defendant
in
both
cases
who
pleaded
guilty
who
thereby
bypassed
state
remedies
for
raising
various
constitutional
claims,
in
tollet
of
course
it
was
the
grand
jury
selection
and
in
mcmann
it
was
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
and
they
were
perfectly
delighted
with
their
pleas
at
the
time
and
presumably
these
were
knowing
in-counsel
pleas
of
voluntary
in
all
respects
counsel
at
their
side
advising
them
presumably
as
to
the
fact
that
if
they
plea,
they
cannot
litigate
anything
further
because
of
state
procedures
in
tennessee
and
in
new
york
at
the
time.
and
then
20
years
after
the
event,
they
come
marching
into
federal
court
after
the
state
has
a
justifiable
expectation
that
the
book
has
been
closed
by
my
case
defendants
having
fail
to
litigate
the
claim
at
all
in
state
court.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
the
neither
opinion
addresses
itself
to
that.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
of
course
it
was
also
as
i
recall
one
of
the
closing
portions
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
tollet
was
that
if
that
the
defendant
was
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
your
opinion
as
well
in
mcmann,
if
the
defendant
was
somehow
mis-advised
as
to
the
forum
which
he
should
first
present
the
claim,
he
might
have
another
habeas
petition
with
competence
of
counsel.
but
it
strikes
me
as
rather
unfair
in
this
case
for
the
state
to
sit
by
and
allow
the
defendants
to
litigate
under
the
aegis
of
the
statute
and
a
very
alluring
aegis
it
is,
not
only
for
the
benefit
of
the
defendant
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
state.
they
avoid,
it's
an
additional
inducement
to
avoid
unnecessary
trials
and
i
certainly
don't
have
to
explain
to
you
what
the
trial
backlog
situation
is
in
new
york,
to
allow
under
this
alluring
aegis
of
the
statute
a
guilty
plea
under
the
promise,
essentially
that
the
plea
does
not
terminate
litigation
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim
without
specifying
when
it
does
and
when
it
doesn’t,
it
just
simply
leaves
it
open.
go
ahead
and
plead,
we
do
not
care.
we're
not
going
to
stop
you
from
litigating
the
fourth
amendment
claim
which
you
have
litigated
in
accordance
with
our
statute
before
the
plea.
go
ahead
and
plea
and
we
don't
consider
litigation
of
this
claim
terminated
by
your
plea,
that
is
the
suggestion
of
813-c
and
then
when
things
get
though
in
federal
court
--
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
for
the
record
doesn't
demonstrate
a
particular
--
articulate
expectations
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
of
course
the
second
circuit
--
the
extent
second
circuit
law
at
the
time.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
no.
at
the
time
he
pleaded
mcmann
had
been
decided.
i
think
it
had
just
had
been
decided
at
the
time
he
pleaded.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
--
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
well
i
think
--
mr.
stanley
neustadter
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
that
the
state
would
not
say
it's
foreclosed
to
him.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no
but
isn't
that
--
rather
is
it
that
statute
rather
pregnant
with
the
suggestion
that
we
have
no
expectation
that
your
plea
has
terminated
litigation
of
the
claim.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
i'd
like
to
get
into
that
now.
the
question
of
--
whether
federal
law
controls
waiver
and
so
forth
really
there
are
two
things,
two
aspects
of
that
problem.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no,
not
for
a
minute.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
--
let
us
put
it
this
way.
assume
that
there
has
been
some
default
because
that
is
what
generally
what
we
are
talking
about,
we're
talking
about
a
waiver,
this
is
some
lapse,
some
failure
to
pursue
a
remedy,
that
some
kind
of
default
in
state
court,
some
failure
to
raise
or
preserve
a
claim
in
a
court,
a
constitutional
claim
in
accordance
with
state
procedures.
now
it's
a
matter
of
federal
law
as
to
whether
that
defect
or
that
default
i
should
say
is
going
to
be
binding
on
the
defendant
to
it.
is
it
voluntary,
knowing
and
so
forth?
what
the
default
waives
is
a
matter
of
state
procedure
or
preferences,
that
is
the
distinction
to
be
drawn.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
this
is
true
but
the
entire
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
is
tied
into
state
procedures.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
absolutely
not.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
yes,
yes.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
it
was
very
clear
in
the
law
of
the
circuit,
certainly.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well,
right
now
wisconsin
has
an
identical
statute.
there's
a
proposed
code
of
indiana
that
has
adopted.
both
of
those
state
by
the
way
specifically
referring
to
the
new
york
procedure.
it
is
all
that
new
york
procedure
has
also
been
recommended
by
the
aba
standards
and
very
recently
just
last
august
by
the
uniform
commission
of
the
--
the
people
who
have
drafted
the
uniform
code
of
criminal
procedures.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
excuse
me?
mr.
stanley
neustadter
is
it
in
washington?
yes
i
believe
also
washington.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
california
has
something
like
--
that's
a
slightly
different
arrangement.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well,
there's
a
case
right
now
i
believe
pending
in
the
seventh
circuit
with
respect
to
a
wisconsin
defendant
--
mr.
stanley
neustadter
and
that's
being
held
in
abeyance
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
in
the
ninth
circuit
case
--.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
in
the
ninth
circuit
van
b.
smith
about
i
guess
it's
about
a
year
ago
now,
held
the
other
way
although
there
is
quite
a
distinction
in
the
state
procedure.
it
is
not
really
exactly
--
mr.
stanley
neustadter
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
the
same
would
hold
true
in
non
813-c
context.
any
plea
bargaining
concept,
there's
a
deal
for
both
sides.
the
state
avoids
a
trial,
the
defendant
avoids
presumably
longer
sentence.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no
but
what
that
suggests
is
that
the
state
wants
that
plea
so
badly
that
they
are
going
to
give
another
little
goody
to
the
defendant
not
only
do
you
get
a
break
in
terms
of
the
length
of
the
sentence,
but
we're
going
to
allow
you
to
appeal
any
pre-plea
motions
you've
litigated,
that’s
how
badly
new
york
wants
those
guilty
pleas.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
i
haven't
heard
the
other
view
expressed
but
presumably
mr.
hammer
have
something
to
say
--.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
i
know,
that
seems
to
--
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
neither
do
i.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
i
can
explain
that
anomalous
position
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
concede
as
the
petitioner
has
that
certiorari
review,
it
remains
open
not
withstanding
the
plea,
and
by
the
way
that
the
new
york
procedure
on
a
cert
case
here,
on
a
motion
is
suppress
in
sibron
commended
itself
to
a
footnote
in
sibron,
you
know
the
court
was
perfectly
aware
that
they
were
taking
a
case
on
cert
notwithstanding
a
plea.
and
i
can
explain
the
anomaly
as
to
why
one
aspect
of
federal
jurisdiction
to
which
this
court
on
direct
review
should
have
the
power
to
vindicate
this
constitutional
claim,
but
for
some
magical
reason
another
federal
court,
the
district
court
was
somehow
divested
of
that
power,
this
i
simply
can
understand
and
i've
heard
nothing
from
petitioner
to
explain
it.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
and
2254
says
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
habeas
corpus
but
i
don't
think
we
can
ignore
the
fact
that
the
touchstone
of
habeas
corpus
in
2254
(d)
are
state
procedures.
after
all
what
are
we
talking
about
when
we
are
talking
about
exhaustion?
we're
talking
about
presenting
an
issue
to
state
court
under
whatever
state
procedures
are
available
to
present
that
claim.
that
is
what
is
required
of
the
defendant
before
he
can
come
in
and
invoke
federal
habeas
protection.
now
what
has
happened
in
this
case?
the
state
has
set
forth
a
series
of
procedures
which
the
defendant
has
followed
chapter
and
verse.
he
presented
his
claim
precisely
the
way
the
state
court
has
allowed
him
to
do.
the
claim
has
certainly
of
constitutional
dimensions,
there
is
no
custody
problem,
he
has
exhausted
his
state
remedies,
he
has
not
bypassed
any
of
them,
he
has
ostensibly
met
every
requirement
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
and
for
some
magical
reason
we
are
told
that
the
plea
simply
erases
the
print
on
the
habeas
statute
books.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
i
think
new
york
state
has
found
for
the
contrary
because
in
1970,
813-c,
when
the
whole
criminal
code
of
new
york
was
redrafted,
reenacted
813-c
in
the
face
of
those
three
second
circuit
decisions
which
had
already
allowed
habeas
relief.
in
other
words,
when
the
legislature
reenacted
813-c,
the
new
code
of
criminal
procedure,
they
did
it
right
in
the
teeth
of
those
three
second
circuit
opinions
and
i
can't
believe
that
they
would
have
done
that,
had
they
thought
that
those
decisions
somehow
affected
their
plea
bargaining
process.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
that
is
correct.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
i.d.,
identification
cases,
wade-gilbert
problems.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
that
can
be
litigated
pretrial
plead,
appeal
and
so
on,
that
is
correct.
wiretap
problems
also.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
yes
--
mr.
stanley
neustadter
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
before
1970
before
this
new
statute,
you
could
not
plea,
you
could
not
litigate
a
way
gilbert
issue
plead
and
then
appeal,
that
you
have
to
go
to
trial
for.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
that
was
added.
that
is
a
new
one.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
four
years
have
past
since
mcmann
and
not
creature
is
stirring
in
the
legislature
with
respect
with
the
changing
statute.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
in
the
four
years
that
have
elapsed
since
mcmann,
they
could
have
modified
their
view
accordingly.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
well
i
can't
point
to
legislative
documents
to
say
what
they
considered
and
what
they
don't,
i’m
simply
drawing
an
inference
from
the
existence
of
very
clear
pronouncements
by
the
second
circuit
with
respect
to
new
york
statutes
and
i'm
drawing
the
further
inference
that
state
legislatures
that
was
made
up
60%
of
lawyers
at
least
a
few
of
them
were
aware
of
this
decisions.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
and
reenacted
in
anyway.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
no.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
yes
that's
precisely
the
point.
mr.
stanley
neustadter
yes.
i
really
have
said
just
about
everything
i
want
to
say
with
really
two
small
exceptions
which
i’m
going
to
close
with.
i
like
to
repeat
two
things
and
really
that’s
all
i
hope
you
remember
when
you’re
go
into
confront
this
case
and
that
is
that
the
consequences
of
a
plea
of
guilty
or
waiver
call
it
what
you
may
within
the
context
of
habeas
corpus
problems
simply
cannot
be
determined
in
an
abstract
vacuum.
you
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
entire
state
procedural
context
and
that’s
because
the
entire
habeas
corpus
statute
is
geared
in
towards
state
procedures.
what
did
the
state
give
him?
what
did
he
--
what
would
the
state
in
term
of
remedies
allow
him
to
use?
did
he
avail
himself
of
the
remedies
the
state
gave
him?
everything
is
keyed
in
to
what
the
state
remedial
context
is
and
does
not
proscribe
that
only
state
trials
preserve
an
issue
for
habeas
corpus
review,
whatever
state
procedures
are
available.
and
finally
if
there
is
a
waiver
in
this
case,
it
is
the
petitioner’s
waiver,
it
is
the
state’s
waiver
by
enacting
section
813-c
essentially
which
i
presume
was
a
voluntary
and
counseled
and
knowing
and
intelligent
act.
the
state
has
abandoned
its
expectation
of
the
plea
of
guilty
terminated
litigation
of
this
constitutional
claim.
thank
you.
