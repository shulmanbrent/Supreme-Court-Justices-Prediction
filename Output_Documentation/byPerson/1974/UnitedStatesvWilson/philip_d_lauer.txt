mr.
philip
d.
lauer
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
it's
the
opinion
of
the
petitioner
i
should
say,
i'm
sorry,
it's
the
submission
of
the
respondent
in
this
matter
and
i
understand
that
too
have
been
the
submission
of
the
respondent
in
the
matter
heard
by
you
just
previously,
that
the
position
of
the
government
would
require
if
accepted
by
you,
a
holding
that
would
be
too
narrow
on
double
jeopardy
grounds
for
reasonable
application
in
all
cases.
we
have
heard
this
morning
and
again
this
afternoon
of
the
government's
feeling
that
in
this
particular
case
and
in
the
jenkins
case
which
preceded
it,
that
you
could
in
effect
allow
an
appeal
despite
the
provisions
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
for
several
reasons.
first
they
present
to
you
the
proposition
that
to
do
so,
would
not
violate,
or
actually
would
not
even
implicate
the
double
jeopardy
clause
because
there
would
be
no
retrial.
prior
to
--
following
that
through
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
recite
however
something
before
it
slips
away
from
me
altogether.
there
is,
i
think
one
other
fact
that
i
would
like
to
add
to
the
factual
discussion
made
thus
far
by
mr.
frey
and
that
is
that,
in
its
review
--
in
its
order
of
the
court
which
took
the
form
of
memorandum
of
opinion,
the
district
judge
referred
extensively,
we
submit,
to
trial
testimony
and
i
think
that
that
is
important
for
reasons
which
i
will
try
to
develop
during
the
course
of
this
argument.
namely
that,
the
judge
did
not
simply
as
is
urged
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
rely
upon
facts
which
were
found
at
pretrial
hearing,
and
we
also
submit
that
it's
impossible
to
intelligently
find
that
the
facts
of
that
pretrial
hearing
were
the
same
facts
which
were
ultimately
found
or
which
were
ultimately
presented
at
the
time
of
trial.
it's
our
opinion
and
we've
set
it
forth
in
the
brief,
i
believe
in
some
detail,
that
the
facts
taken
at
the
trial
and
the
facts
upon
which
the
court
relied
in
its
opinion
were
considerably
greater
in
volume,
considerably
more
varied
at
the
time
of
trial.
it
also
seems
apparent
and
i
will
come
back
to
this,
it
seems
apparent
that
the
district
judge
prior
to
trial
having
heard
this
argument
and
heard
some
testimony
on
two
occasions
concluded
on
both
of
those
occasions
that
there
were
no
facts
at
least
which
were
satisfactory
to
him
to
warrant
consideration,
favorable
consideration
of
our
pretrial
motion.
however,
and
this
is
intimated
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
he
must
have
changed
his
mind
for
some
reason
and
the
government
would
conclude
that
it
was
simply
a
change
of
mind.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
did
the
judge's
ruling
have
anything
at
all
to
do
with
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence?
yes,
sir
i
believe
it
did.
i
would
say
to
you
first
of
all
that,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
the
classical
kind
of
decision
which
says,
specifically,
we
do
not
believe
the
evidence
in
this
case
to
have
been
sufficient
to
warrant
a
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes,
i
believe
it
did.
it
said
in
this
context.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
okay,
i
believed
it
did
in
this
context.
i
believe
that
it
discussed
the
question
in
very
brief
terms
admittedly
of
whether
or
not
the
testimony
of
the
individuals
whose
absence
was
challenged
by
the
respondent
in
this
matter,
would
have
been
a
subject
of
some
import
in
making
the
determination
as
to
guilt
or
innocence,
but
it
did
not
specifically
make
that
determination,
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
to
be
substantially
correct,
but
i
don't
believe
that
disposes,
if
your
honor
please,
of
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
order
constituted
an
acquittal.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes.
since
--
as
i
was
suggesting
previously,
but
he
did
not
himself
find
that
the
jury
verdict
should
have
been
one
or
the
other,
but
it's
clear
from
his
opinion
and
it's
even
clear,
i
would
submit
upon
a
careful
reading
of
the
record
and
the
record
papers
that,
what
is
an
issue
or
what
was
an
issue
before
the
district
judge
at
that
point
is
whether
the
outcome
would
have
been
substantially
affected
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
people,
we
submit
would
have
been
available
had
not
the
government's
substantial
claim.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
that
is
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
that
is
our
position
sir.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes,
sir.
we
believe
that
it
--
well,
yes
it
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
but
it
does
not
as
mr.
justice
marshall
is
saying,
it
does
not
specifically
make
that
finding.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
well
i
think
that
perhaps
he
could
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
perhaps,
what
he
could
have
done
is
assume
and
did
not
do
incidentally,
he
could
have
perhaps
assumed
that
the
witness
would
have
spoken
in
terms
similar
to
those
presented
by
us
in
our
argument
and
then
in
our
papers,
and
made
a
determination
on
that
basis,
but
it
clearly
would
not
been
a
fit
basis
for
disposing
of
the
action
in
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
that's
correct.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i
think,
if
i
may
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
that's
correct.
but
i
think
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
alright.
i
think
that
to
reach
that
point,
you
have
to
retreat
in
my
opinion
from
your
previous
discussion
of
what
constitutes
an
acquittal
as
formulated
in
sisson
and
subsequently
cited
with
approval.
because
it's
our
position
that
in
getting
to
this
point
–
well,
first
of
all,
it's
obvious
that
the
district
judge
couldn't
or
felt
that
he
could
not
make
those
kinds
of
determinations
pretrial.
and
that
in
fact,
in
order
to
make
that
determination,
he
required
himself
to
listen
to
and
consider
carefully
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.
in
fact
logically,
it's
the
only
way
that
the
motion
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
based
upon
facts
which
he
didn't
learn
until
he
was
tried,
that's
correct.
that's
substantially
correct,
that
he
should
probably
not
have
--
much
probably
that
he
should
not
have
been
tried
and
could
not
again
be
fairly
tried
on
the
basis
of
the
prejudice.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
the
facts
did
go
to
prejudice,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
oh,
are
you
asking
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
correct.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
correct.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
that
is
the
connection
with
the
fact
finding,
yes.
my
point
is
that
that
kind
of
fact
finding,
i'm
sorry,
that
kind
of
decision
based
upon
that
kind
of
fact
finding
could
not
be
made
in
a
case
such
as
this
one
until
in
fact
the
trial
had
been
complete.
by
reason
of
the
--
it
could
have
been
made
pretrial,
if
a
judge
was
willing,
if
i
may
characterize
it
this
way,
to
stick
out
his
neck
and
say
that
on
the
basis
of
what
i
think
the
government's
going
to
show,
you
would
have
needed
these
people.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
not
the
speedy
trial
issue
but
the
due
process
issue
requires
a
determination
of
prejudice,
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
that's
correct.
we
don't
disagree
at
all
with
that.
what
we're
saying
however
is
that
to
the
extent
that
that
kind
of
procedure
becomes
necessary
in
order
for
the
judge
to
make
such
a
decision
and
if
the
facts
upon
which
he
is
going
to
make
that
decision
are
facts
which
go
to
the
general
issue
in
the
case,
then
that
situation
is
indistinguishable
from
the
kind
of
an
acquittal
that
you
approved
with
the--
of
course
in
sisson.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
was
not
speaking
of
you
personally.
some
of
you
approved
and
it
is
our
--
and
that's
equally
obvious,
sir.
it
is
our
position
however,
that
to
retreat
from
that
at
this
point
in
time
and
to
try
to
redefine
it,
would
be
perhaps
again
to
venture
into
an
area
where
a
definition
may
not
be
appropriate.
we
think
the
definition
and
we've
urged
this
in
our
brief
that
you
as
a
body,
have
previously
enunciated,
is
appropriate
and
that
it
fairly
and
accurately,
and
predictably
defines
what
an
acquittal
is.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
if
i
may,
i
would
not
only
retreat
from
that,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
that
we
could
not
have
done
it
by
affidavit.
in
fact,
we
did
it
in
this
case
by
two
pretrial
hearings,
we
didn't
do
them
by
affidavit.
but
nonetheless,
those
hearings
without
the
production
of
all
of
the
government's
testimony,
without
the
production
of
defense
testimony,
having
to
do
with
issues
that
have
to
do
clearly
with
items
of
credibility,
really,
is
not
as
persuasive
as
you
have
just
put
it,
as
a
determination
made
after
having
heard
of
all
that.
for
instance,
in
this
particular
case,
we
had
a
pretrial
hearing
initially
in
which
the
judge
denied
the
motion
from
the
bench
without
any
additional
consideration.
when
we
came
back
for
trial,
we
were
informed
that
the
court
was
still
concerned
and
we
proceeded
to
put
on
to
some
additional
testimony.
now,
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
we
did
not
try
the
entire
case.
we
didn't
have
the
serfass
case.
we
unfortunately
are
not
a
draft
case,
where
we
can
take
a
file
and
present
it
to
a
judge,
and
thereby
have
him
have
everything
that
the
government
knows
about
the
case.
there
was
substantially
more
in
the
government's
case,
there
was
substantially
more
in
our
case.
and
we
would
submit
that
if
it
requires
this
kind
of
consideration
of
fundamental
facts
which
go
to
the
general
issue
in
the
case,
then
we
fall
right
in
the
middle
of
the
sisson
definition
of
an
acquittal.
and
that
this
case
is
the
equivalent
of
an
acquittal
under
the
facts
in
this
case
or
under
the
facts
in
any
case,
under
the
facts
in
some
of
the
cases
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i
think
that
--
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
really
because
i
think
that
that
kind
of
a
decision
as
you
voiced
it
to
me
or
as
i
understand
it,
the
question
involves
one
with
the
court
has
in
fact
cerebrated
about
these
very
things
and
decided,
well
for
some
reason,
i'm
not
going
to
do
it
at
this
point,
i'll
let
the
jury
do
it.
i
don't
think
the
same
kind
of
reasoning
applied
here
at
all.
i
think
that
for
reasons
which
i
am
not
privy
to
and
reasons
incidentally
which
support,
i
believe
our
view
as
to
how
an
acquittal
should
be
defined,
the
judge
at
that
point
was
not
able
to
conclude
what
he
subsequently
was
in
fact
able
to
conclude.
and
i
submit
that
the
test
previously
propounded
here
or
something
very
similar
to
it,
is
vitally
necessary
because
i
think
that
this
court
and
the
circuit
courts
are
going
to
continue
to
be
confronted
with
situations
where
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
judge
in
fact
entered
an
order
which
is
an
acquittal
or
which
is
a
purely
legal
ruling
as
the
court
would
have
you
--
i'm
sorry,
as
the
petitioner
would
have
you
believe.
and
that
without
some
kind
of
predictable
formulation
of
what
an
acquittal
is
that
you're
going
to
be
confronted
with
this
problem
over
and
over.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
well,
it
has
statutory
significance
in
the
sense
that
double
jeopardy
clause
is
the
only
thing
which
stands
between
the
government
and
its
appeal.
but
you
know
clearly,
that's
begging
the
question,
what
happens
is
you've
got
to
get
over
the
hurdle
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
this
case
or
in
any
other
to
be
able
to
have
that
appeal.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes,
sir.
i
don't
see
that
i
can
avoid
that,
taking
this
position.
we
--
if
i
may
return
to
it
at
least
briefly,
i
would
like
very
much
to
respond
to
a
portion
of
the
earlier
remarks
of
the
petitioner
in
this
matter.
there
is
the
question
as
the
petitioner
has
presented
it
of
whether
simply,
well
not
simply,
whether
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
no
retrial
is
required
in
this
matter,
whether
the
implications
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
avoided.
that's
one
peg
in
the
line
of
reasoning
of
the
petitioner
and
there's
further,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
clear
question
of
law,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
not
implicated
or
rather
perhaps
more
accurately,
whether
it
does
therefore
not
become
an
acquittal
which
would
implicate
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
it's
our
position
that
this
reading
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
too
narrow.
and
we
would
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
the
statement
that
no
trial
will
result
cannot
be
dispositive
of
the
double
jeopardy
issue
in
this
or
any
other
case.
it's
been
stated
in
a
recent
harvard
law
review
article
that
i
believed
was
written
sometime
after
the
briefs
in
this
case
were
filed
or
at
least
about
the
same
time,
that
perhaps
in
these
kinds
of
cases,
the
question
of
when
jeopardy
attaches
is
no
longer
a
relevant
inquiry
or
at
least
not
a
relevant
inquiry
in
this
kind
of
case,
because
it's
the
kind
of
inquiry
which
is
very
relevant
in
cases
involving
premature
mistrials,
in
the
perez
or
illinois
v.
summerville
cases,
but
perhaps
that's
not
a
relevant
inquiry
here.
what
we're
suggesting
to
you
is
that
that
kind
of
inquiry
is
relevant
in
this
particular
case
for
this
reason.
we
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
jeopardy
has
attached
in
mr.
wilson's
case.
assuming
the
technical
jeopardy
terms
about
which
there
was
much
discussion,
mr.
justice
white's
dissenting
opinion
in
sisson,
there's
no
question
we
have
technical
jeopardy
in
that
a
jury
was
empaneled.
the
jury
in
fact
heard
the
whole
case,
rendered
the
verdict.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
upon
the
granting
of
an
acquittal,
if
that's
in
fact
what
this
order
was,
in
fact
the
jeopardy
was
there
upon
terminated.
the
defendant
at
that
point
in
time
was
no
longer
in
a
position
of
jeopardy
and
that
bringing
him
back
or
after
a
successful
appeal
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
is
once
again
going
to
expose
him
to
the
kinds
of
risk
which
constitute
jeopardy.
the
situation
which
has
developed
in
this
case
is
indicative
of
this
we
believe,
but
we
think
that
it's
important
to
keep
this
kind
of
a
test
in
mind
in
determining
whether
or
not
double
jeopardy's
principles
are
going
to
be
violated.
now
the
government
says,
“unless
you
go
back
for
a
trial,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
will
not
be
implicated
and
you
will
not
be
violating
the
double
jeopardy
clause.�?
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
not
sensible,
it
is
not
logical,
and
it
does
not
follow
the
double
jeopardy
clause
for
this
reason.
this
court
has
said
for
instance
in
price
versus
georgia
and
i
believe
in
the
chief
justice's
opinion
as
i
recall,
that
the
twice
put
in
jeopardy
language
of
the
constitution
thus,
relates
to
a
potential
i.e.
the
risk
that
an
accused
for
a
second
time
will
be
convicted
of
the
same
offense
for
which
he
was
initially
tried.
there
are
other
references
in
our
brief
and
elsewhere
to
the
fact
that,
that
although
this
kind
of
situation
obviously
arises
most
frequently
where
there
in
fact
has
been
a
second
trial
and
perhaps
a
second
conviction,
that
to
implicate
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
you
need
not
have
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i
would
say
that
if
it
were
a
statute
of
limitations
issue
which
could
have
constituted
a
jury
defense
and
if
the
court
found
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
no,
i'm
saying
that
it
perhaps
--
that
it
could
formed
--
there
could
be
a
question
in
fact,
well
maybe
i'm
reading
too
much
in
your
question.
for
instance
what
i'm
saying
is
if
there
were
a
question
and
i
believe
that
this
is
done,
if
there
were
a
question
as
to
times,
dates,
and
so
forth,
and
the
question
of
the
statute
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
and
the
court
acted
on
that
kind
of
information
and
subsequent
to
the
trial
reversed
it
on
whatever
label
it
decided
to
use,
that
i
don't
believe
that
kind
of
order
would
be
appealable.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
then,
i
would
say
that
for
the
reasons
we've
advanced
in
this
case,
that
if
the
decision
concerned,
not
concerned
itself
but
founded
itself
upon
trial
testimony
going
to
the
fundamental
issue
in
some
cases,
it
would
not
be
appealable.
now
obviously,
where
the
defendant
has
initiated
the
review
and
this
is
--
there
are
many
cases
covering
this,
where
the
defendant
has
initiated
the
review
himself
by
himself
asking
for
a
new
trial,
that
is
a
different
circumstance
because
this
court
has
held
and
there
are
many
other
cases
thoroughly
talking
about
it
that
the
defendant
has
in
fact
waived
his
right
to
even
discuss
the
question
of
double
jeopardy.
but
if
you
have
a
situation
not
unlike
this
one,
where
the
court
for
reasons
that
and
i
think
that
perhaps
a
better
--
perhaps
not
an
example
of
what
you're
talking
about
but
another
kind
of
issue
with
which
we
are
very
much
concern,
is
supposing
the
trial
judge
for
some
reason
had
heard
the
matter,
perhaps
without
the
jury,
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony
of
the
government
which
clearly
made
out
the
offense,
the
defense
rested
without
presenting
any
testimony
and
the
judge
thereafter
enters
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
and
even
an
explicated
verdict
of
not
guilty.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
there
is
--
regardless
of
how
the
judge
comes
to
that
decision,
it's
not
critical
whether
or
not
--
it's
not
critical
in
this
discussion,
whether
or
not
it's
labeled
anything
in
particular.
it
is
critical
we
would
submit,
whether
or
not
the
defense
through
some
reason
of
his
own
has
waived
the
double
jeopardy
question
or
whether
you
get
into
a
question
of
manifest
necessity,
or
one
of
the
reasons
why
double
jeopardy
has
been
found
not
to
apply.
but
we
would
say
that
if
the
defendant
through
none
of
his
conduct
waived
it
and
if
the
court
in
considering
the
matter,
used
trial
testimony,
used
fundamental
issues,
i'm
sorry,
fundamental
testimony
in
the
case
going
to
the
fundamental
issue
in
the
case,
then
we
would
submit
that
you
have
a
situation
where
it
is
not
appealable.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i
don't
think
that
fact
alone
waives
it.
no,
i
think
that
you
waive
it
where
you
make
and
succeed
perhaps
on
a
post
trial
motion,
the
essence
of
which
is
something
not
cognizable
under
double
jeopardy.
i'm
talking
about
you
make
and
succeed
on
a
motion
for
new
trial
law.
obviously,
if
you're
asking
for
a
new
trial
you're
not
going
to
be
heard
subsequently
to
make
the
double
jeopardy
claim
when
the
new
trial
occurs.
i
recognize
to
the
expression
on
your
face
that
i
may
not
have
completely
answered
the
question,
but
i
believe
that
i've
expressed
our
opinion
at
least
that
this
kind
of
a
decision
by
the
court
would
be
non-appealable.
the
other
area
that
we
think
is
of
substantial
concern,
well
there
are
a
number
of
them.
we
feel
that
another
area
of
substantial
concern
is
the
government's
reliance
in
the
presentation
and
the
submission
of
the
issue
to
you
that
this
is
strictly
a
legal
ruling.
we
don't
believe
that.
we
don't
believe
that
it
is
strictly
a
legal
ruling
and
the
government,
the
petitioner
in
this
matter,
a
few
moments
ago
stated
to
you
that
we
don't
think
it's
important
or
relevant
to
get
involved
in
a
lengthy
discussion
as
to
a
fact/law
issue
or
whether
or
not
this
is
an
issue
of
law
or
fact.
but
the
very
fundamental
principle
that
they
are
putting
to
you
in
this
matter
is
that
it
is
strictly
a
question
of
law
and
that's
the
reason,
if
i
may
submit
so
and
if
i
may
raise
my
voice
to
that
extent,
that's
the
reason
why
you're
being
asked
to
allow
this
matter
to
go
back
and
simply
correct
a
pure
error
of
law.
we
would
submit
that
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
case
and
that
it's
almost
hard
to
dream
of
a
case
where
that
is
true.
although,
i
think
some
of
the
examples
perhaps
you
see
here
this
morning
maybe
precisely
that,
but
that
is
not
the
case
in
the
wilson
case
where
issues,
clear
issues
of
fact
had
to
be
considered
in
order
to
arrive
at
that
question.
the
obvious
answer
to
that
line
of
reasoning
is
well,
yes
there
were
factual
matters
which
had
to
be
resolved
but
in
the
end,
where
the
judge
made
his
mistake
was
the
application
of
the
law.
we
don't
considered
it
to
be
that
simple
and
we
would
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
the
reasons
for
concluding
that
it's
a
fundamental
and
simple
error
of
law
do
not
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i
would
say
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it's
probably
a
mixed
question
of
law
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes,
i
think
so.
in
much
the
same
way
that
a
judge
arrives
eventually
at
a
decision
that
a
given
set
of
facts
warrants
an
acquittal.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
tests
are
the
same
but
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes.
the
same
process
occurs.
one
examines
facts,
one
looks
at
them,
weighs
them,
examines
the
demeanor
of
witnesses
or
whatever
and
based
upon
some
very
fine
tuned
kinds
of
examinations
of
what
has
occurred
in
front
of
you,
one
then
applies
the
given
law
to
that
set
of
facts.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i
would
assume
that
that
would
be
the
kind
of
thinking
that
we
go
through
judge's
mind
if
he
were
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i'm
saying
it's
the
same
kind
of
process,
in
the
sense
that
--
only
in
the
sense
that
the
same
kinds
of
resolution
of
factual
issues
and
application
of
legal
principles
must
occur.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
same
tests,
legal
tests
would
apply
certainly.
but
to
the
extent
that
both
of
them
must
go
on,
then
clearly
you
have
in
every
case
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact
and
the
only
place,
the
only
kind
of
case
where
the
government's
particular
kind
of
submission
to
you
in
this
case
is
going
to
apply
is
where
you
have
no
question
whatever
we
would
submit
about
the
facts,
but
merely
a
legal
issue
which
the
judge
has
somehow
erroneously
included.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i
don't
understand
your
question,
sir
because
i'm
specifically
not
saying
that
one
is
law
and
one
is
fact.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
yes,
i
disagree
with
one
of
the
fundamental
propositions
of
it.
but
i
do
understand
your
question,
yes,
or
at
least
i
understand
the
statement.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
one
is
law,
one
is
fact.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
government
says
to
you
that
it
can
be
considered
by
you
and
can
be
appealed
because
one
is
clearly
law
and
one
is
clearly
fact.
and
i'm
simply
suggesting
that's
not
true
in
this
case
and
it's
almost
hard
to
dream
of
the
case
where
it
is
true
insufficient
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
well,
that's
what
i
would
suggest
--
well,
yes.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i
set
aside
the
juried
verdict
and
i
acquit.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i
would
suggest
the
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
i
do
not
believe
so,
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
and
well
--
the
--
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
part
of
the
government
submission
in
this
case,
if
your
honor
please
is
that
one
of
the
reasons
they
can
appeal,
in
jenkins,
in
particular
is
that
the
court
explained
why
it
made
its
mistake.
and
in
fact,
i
would
submit
that
implicit
in
that
argument
is
if
the
court
had
not
explained
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
to
the
world
at
large
why
it
had
made
an
error
that
it
would
not
have
been
appealable.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
well,
i
maybe
exaggerating
for
the
sake
of
argument.
but
i
do
believe
that
the
government's
position
is
that
it
gets
this
ability
to
ask
you
to
correct
these
kinds
of
errors
from
the
fact
that
the
decision
is
purely
legal
and
we're
submitting
that
that's
just
simply
not
the
case.
there
is
almost
--
a
friend
once
concluded
that
he
felt
like
a
beggar
at
a
banquet
and
there's
an
incredible
issue
number
of
issues
to
cover
here
and
it's
obvious
that
were
not
going
to
reach
them
all.
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
talk
very
briefly
about
some
of
the
rest
of
them.
the
government
has
referred
repeatedly
to
kepner,
fong
foo,
united
states
versus
ball
and
so
forth.
we
agree
that
united
states
versus
ball,
that
the
language
in
united
states
versus
ball
which
has
been
referred
to
was
not
language
which
was
the
holding
of
the
case.
however,
we
submit
that
since
that
time
that
very
language
has
become
the
holding
of
this
court,
repeatedly.
and
we
feel
that
in
particular,
to
get
to
the
government's
point,
you're
not
only
going
to
have
to
reconsider
cases
such
as
sisson,
but
you're
going
to
have
to
consider
and
i
would
submit
overrule
fong
foo
in
order
to
get
to
the
point
that
the
government
would
take
you.
fong
foo
is
an
interesting
case
because
clearly
that
case
would
have
required
a
second
trial,
there
isn't
any
question
about
that,
but
the
characterization
as
an
acquittal
was
certainly,
eminently
attackable
in
that
case.
it
was
characterized
as
i
recall
it
as
being
egregiously
erroneous,
nonetheless,
the
acquittal
was
left
to
stand.
now
that
decision,
if
there
ever
was
one,
was
a
complete
total
error
of
law.
there
was
no
legal
justification
whatever
for
what
the
judge
did,
no
matter
what
he
might
have
concluded.
he
could
of
concluded
black
was
white
in
that
case
or
he
could
have
been
correct
about
everything.
it
could
not
have
affected
the
fact
that
he
made
a
complete
total,
as
i
read
the
opinion,
and
as
i've
read
the
lower
court's
opinions,
a
complete
and
total
error
of
law
was
committed
in
that
case.
and
this
court
did
not
permit
itself
to
be
taken
at
that
time
as
far
as
the
government
would
take
you.
i'm
not
certain,
quite
frankly
that
that
issue
was
raised
quite
the
same
way,
but
this
court
did
not
allow
itself
at
that
time
to
be
taken
that
far.
we
would
submit
that
to
go
where
the
government
takes
you
today,
is
going
to
require
a
complete
reconsideration
and
overruling
in
fact
of
fong
foo.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
correct.
yes,
sir.
well
okay,
if
i
may
then
just
very
briefly
in
the
time
remaining
address
myself
to
that.
i've
indicated
it
very
briefly
but
we
do
not
believe
and
we've
tried
to
explain
in
a
brief
that
there
is
a
necessity
for
a
second
trial.
second
trial
--
let
me
state
it
this
way,
second
trial
is
the
most
obvious
situation
that
can
occur
where
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
implicated
and
in
fact
it's
the
only
situation
that's
going
to
get
to
you,
because
if
a
defendant
is
merely
indicted
and
the
indictment
is
somehow
overcome
through
the
efforts
of
defense
counsel,
in
all
likelihood
it's
not
going
to
reach
this
stage.
what
happens
is
that
where
people
become
indicted,
where
the
government,
where
there
is
a
termination
of
one
kind
or
another
which
would
implicate
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
the
government
comes
back
and
it
reaches
a
trial
stage
then
you're
confronted
it
with
the
double
jeopardy
case
in
this
court
or
in
appeals
court
along
the
way.
we're
suggesting
you
don't
have
to
get
to
that
point
however
to
implicate
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
my
time
has
expired
and
i'd
like
to
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
philip
d.
lauer
that's
true.
it
was
totally
wrong
action
and
in
fact
we
would
be
prepared
to
argue
if
necessary,
but
we
felt
it
was
not
necessary
and
we
did
not
put
in
our
brief
the
argument
that
we
have
written
with
respect
to
the
overruling
of
fong
foo.
but
we
think
that's
clearly
in
other
case
and
we
haven't
asked
for
it
here.
now,
i
think
i'd
like
to
close
by
referring
the
court
to
what
judge
learned
hand
said
in
the
zisblatt
case
again
which
is
at
page
17
of
our
brief
in
this
case.
he
said
basically
that,
“although,
the
constitution
gives
an
accused
person
the
benefit
of
any
mistakes
in
his
favor
of
the
first
jury
he
encounters
whether
it
has
passed
upon
as
guilt
or
not,
it
does
not
extend
that
privilege
to
mistakes
in
his
favor
by
the
judge.�?
and
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
in
deciding
this
case
to
consider
why
respondent
wilson
should
be
insulated
from
the
punishment
prescribed
by
law,
if
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
its
ruling.
thank
you
very
much.
