mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
setting
aside
a
commission’s
car
service
order
rendered
pursuant
to
1(15)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
although
the
case
is
couched
in
technical
terms,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
quite
simple.
the
issue
was
whether
the
lower
court
erred
in
finding
that
the
order
of
the
commission
was
a
rate
order
fixed
without
due
process
considerations
or
instead
was
it
an
order
directed
at
the
use
to
which
the
boxcars
were
put.
we
submit
that
service
order
1134
is
a
temporary
order
aimed
at
the
extended
use
of
the
scarce
boxcar
resources
as
mobile
lumber
warehouses
during
a
period
of
unquestioned
transportation
emergency
and
as
such
well
within
the
reach
of
1(15).
this
court
is
well
aware
given
the
light
of
the
allegheny-ludlum
case
in
florida
east
coast
of
the
chronic
boxcar
shortage
facing
the
country
today.
there's
no
need
to
believe
on
that
point.
however,
the
order
that
we
are
considering
here
today
arises
out
of
an
emergency
over
and
above
the
chronic
shortage.
in
1972
and
early
1973,
the
country
was
enjoying
a
tremendous
economic
boom,
record
crops
were
being
harvested
and
moved
to
the
country
elevators
and
a
completely
unexpected
event
happened
to
create
a
transportation
emergency.
the
unprecedented
and
unexpected
russian
grain
deal
completely
strained
and
place
unsustainable
strain
on
the
boxcar
fleet.
the
commission
moved
on
many
fronts
to
make
sure
that
the
cars
moved
in
the
public
interest
during
this
time
of
transportation
emergency.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
no
your
honor.
this
was
in
the
fall
harvest
of
1972
going
into
the
early
spring
of
1973.
this
was
the
time
of
the
crisis
that
hit
the
nation.
the
commission
orchestrated
a
series
of
car
service
orders
to
move
the
cars
expeditiously.
for
instance,
in
service
order
1120,
it
limited
the
number
of
jumbo
covered
hopper
cars
that
were
available
to
any
unit
train
shippers
so
that
all
grain
shippers
would
have
a
fair
share
of
the
--
of
this
transportation
resource
to
move
the
grain.
in
1121,
the
commission
was
faced
with
the
situation
of
growing
congestion
of
the
ports
and
it
cut
back
on
the
free
time
available
to
the
shippers
of
grain.
in
1117,
perhaps
the
most
important
of
the
car
service
order
in
that
series;
the
commission
diverted
coal
cars,
the
open
top
hopper
cars
from
the
coal
industry
to
the
movement
of
grain
and
as
pertinent
here,
the
commission
decided
in
the
face
of
the
emergency
that
unrestrained,
unlimited
reconsignment
by
the
lumber
shippers
was
exacerbating
the
transportation
emergency
and
car
service
order
number
1134
temporaril
limited
the
reconsignment
privileges
of
the
lumber
shippers.
reconsignment
that
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
markedly
different
from
the
transit
privileges
that
this
court
considered
in
the
wichita
case
briefly
a
transit
privilege
allows
the
shipper
to
stop
his
movement
for
the
physical
activity
of
something
like
inspecting
the
grain
or
creosoting
lumber
and
to
continue
on
with
the
movement
and
still
enjoy
the
benefits
of
the
true
rate.
reconsignment
on
the
other
hand
allows
a
stopping
in
movement
simply
to
change
the
billing
or
the
destination
but
preserves
to
the
shipper
the
through
rate.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
in
the
specific
instance
of
lumber
shipping
of
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
and
there
are
various
points
that
have
the
truckage
facilities
which
the
lumber
wholesalers
used
to
stop
the
cars,
to
let
the
cars
sit
out
as
lumber
warehouses
while
a
market
develops.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
that
order.
it's
a
physical
--
there
must
be
physical
facilities
to
set
out
strings
of
boxcars
in
its
--
in
the
order
of
a
couple
of
dozen.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
primarily
in
the
midwest,
but
in
a
far
west
possibly
in
wyoming,
washington
state
but
generally
the
movement
is
correctly
pointed
from
the
northwest
towards
the
east
and
the
reconsignment
points
might
conceivably
be
in
any
place
in
that
quadrant
of
the
country.
and
in
fact,
that
leads
to
an
interesting
point
reconsignment
of
its
very
nature
must
involve
some
degree
of
security
because
a
certain
percentage
of
the
lumber
that's
reconsigned
is
reconsigned
backwards
or
perhaps
not
in
the
most
expeditious
route
to
the
final
destination.
the
lumber
wholesalers
are
the
primary
users
of
the
reconsignment
technique.
a
lumber
is
sold
--
a
lumber
is
marketed
in
two
ways.
primarily,
there
are
large
mills,
lumber
mills
that
have
their
own
storage
capacity
and
their
own
sales
force.
there
are
also
small
mills
which
collectively
provide
the
bulk
of
the
lumber
that
comes
eastward.
the
small
mills
typically
have
no
storage
facilities
nor
that
they
have
a
sales
force.
they
looked
to
the
lumber
wholesalers
off
to
market
the
lumber
and
to
provide
the
--
where
withhold
for
storage.
but
the
lumber
wholesalers
themselves
have
no
storage
capacity.
they
simply
purchase
the
lumber
and
immediately
cost
it
to
be
loaded
on
to
the
boxcars
and
set
the
boxcars
in
motion
eastward
and
the
boxcars
are
held
that
the
reconsignment
point
until
a
market
is
made.
the
boxcars,
while
they're
at
a
reconsignment
point,
are
subject
only
to
the
external
stimulus
of
demurrage.
under
the
tariffs
they're
pertaining,
there
is
no
limit
to
the
time
that
the
boxcars
can
sit
idle.
demurrage
is
the
only
incentive
to
get
the
cars
moving.
but
in
a
case
of
a
rising
market,
a
case
of
an
inflationary
time,
the
demurrage
incentive
has
typically
been
found
not
to
excite
fast
release
of
the
scarce
boxcars.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
they
do.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
well,
your
honor
if
the
demurrage
was
increased
sufficiently
as
you
put
it,
the
exact
--
the
limitation
of
the
storage
time
would
still
be
uncertain.
demurrage
as
you
know
has
a
gradual
increase.
the
overriding
need
that
the
commission
felt
was
to
get
the
cars
back
into
motion
quickly
and
within
a
time
period
that
was
reasonably
determined
to
be
five
working
days.
an
increase
in
the
demurrage
rate
would
provide
an
incentive,
you're
correct
in
asking
that
question
getting
the
cars
back
but
it's
not
certain
when
it
would
become
economically
feasible,
economically
sufficient
in
magnitude
to
get
the
cars
rolling.
the
commission
in
this
case
felt
a
need
to
get
the
cars
back
in
at
least
five
days.
and
as
the
commission
stated
in
its
service
order
itself,
demurrage
hadn't
been
working
in
this
particular
segment
of
the
economy.
it
hadn't
been
providing
a
significant
incentive
to
get
the
cars
back
on
motion.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
well,
it
can
be
structured
of
any
where
the
commission
chooses
i
believe
but
it's
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes,
in
step
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
during
the
emergency
period,
the
commission
looked
very
carefully
at
the
statistics
of
just
what
distortions
in
the
transportation
system
were
being
provided
by
the
reconsignment
technique.
and
i
have
found
that
by
early
1973,
the
supply
of
the
40-foot
wide
door
boxcars
was
averaging
in
a
daily
basis
over
600.
the
50-foot
cars
were
over
2,200
scarce.
and
of
all
boxcars,
we
were
experiencing
a
scarcity
of
something
in
the
order
of
13,000
cars.
meanwhile,
the
commission's
studies
show
that
the
average
whole
time
of
reconsignment
point
was
10
days
and
holding
experiences
of
20
to
30
days
were
not
uncommon.
in
this
light,
a
commission
determined
that
the
emergency
was
being
exacerbated
by
the
reconsignment
technique
and
issued
car
service
order
number
1134.
in
the
face
of
the
order
itself,
the
commission's
rationale
was
completely
outlined.
the
commission
found
that
the
shortage
of
boxcars
was
impeding
the
movement
of
many
commodities
that
the
cars
were
being
held
for
excessive
periods
of
reconsignment
points,
that
the
practice
was
immobilizing
cars
needed
by
shippers
of
other
commodities
and
perhaps
most
important
that
demurrage
technique
was
not
a
sufficient
incentive
to
get
the
cars
moving.
so,
the
commission
suspended
as
it
can
under
1(15)
(a)
the
car
service
rule
which
is
embodied
in
open-ended
reconsignment.
it
limited
reconsignment
to
five
days,
it
did
not
eliminate
reconsignment.
the
commission
went
one
step
further
and
explained
in
gratuitous
language
what
the
legal
effect
was
of
suspending
the
car
service
rule.
it
explained
the
purpose
of
the
car
service
order,
it
explained
the
result
that
after
the
fifth
day,
after
the
reconsignment
privilege
has
terminated
the
shipper
must
bear
as
he
would
anyways
some
of
the
local
rates.
those
words
are
not
words
of
rate
prescription,
they
are
a
merely
description
of
what
the
legal
affect
of
the
order
is.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
indeed,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
sir.
there's
a
case
exactly
in
point
that
upholds
a
car
service
order
of
this
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
indeed.
they
were
in
a
bind.
precisely,
in
a
bind
and
i
explained
candidly
in
the
footnote,
i
did
not
locate
those
car
service
orders
until
after
the
court
had
rendered
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
there
is
a
stipulation.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes,
indeed,
that's
the
case.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
no
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i'd
like
to
try
and
answer
your
question
this
way:
the
commission
suspendeit
as
it
can
under
1(15)(a)
the
car
service
rule
which
allows
through
rate
privileges
with
reconsignment.
it
look
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
that
was
in
the
tariff.
the
fact
that
was
in
the
tariff
does
not
limit
the
commission's
ability
to
suspend
it
under
1(15)
(a),
the
commission
has
given
extremely
broad
powers
to
suspend
any
and
all
practices
or
rules
during
a
transportation
emergency.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
this
must,
yes
your
honor.
this
must
the
car
service
rule
must
embrace
tolls
that
are
imbedded
in
tariffs.
the
commission
did
not
set
rates,
it
only
limited
the
use
of
boxcars
as
warehouses
for
five
days
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
the
face
of
1(15),
it
has
the
power
to
do
that.
1(15)
(a)
gives
the
commission
power
in
an
emergency
to
suspend
any
rule,
any
and
all
rules
in
effect
with
respect
to
car
service.
car
service,
in
turn,
is
defined
by
1(10)
as
to
embrace
the
use
to
which
cars
are
put.
reading
1(10)
and
reading
1(15)
together,
the
commission
must
have
under
1(15)
and
we
submit
it
does
have
the
ability
to
suspend
car
service
rules
embedded
in
tariffs.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
precisely
that,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
the
rate
--
exactly,
that
the
option
is
left
with
the
shipper.
as
long
as
the
shipper
seeks
only
transportation
and
reasonable
reconsignment,
there's
absolutely
no
change
in
the
rate
he
must
pay.
and
in
effect,
car
service
order
number
1134
reached
precisely
that
goal.
the
average
detention
time
was
driven
down
to
five
days.
there
has
been
very
--
i
have
not
received
any
information
that
there
has
been
much
of
any
additional
charges
paid.
the
average
whole
time
was
brought
down
within
the
reach
of
the
car
service
order
and
the
cars
moved
in
the
public
interest
during
the
crisis
the
order
worked.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
the
shipper
would
pay
,mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
through
rate
from
portland
to
denver.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
even
with
that
built-in
security
that
i
eluded
to
earlier,
that
the
security
is
a
--
it's
a
part
of
the
practice
that
is
necessary
if
reconsignment
is
fully
a
part
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
i
believe
that's
right,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
and
that
leads
me
to
a
point
that
this
court
touched
upon
way
back
in
a
turner
lumber
case
that
reconsignment
privileges
are
during
times
of
economic
crisis
anyway
is
inherently
ways
for
transportation
resources.
they
have
been
tolerated
by
the
commission.
they
haven't
been
formally
promulgated
in
anyway.
the
tariff
provisions
provided
--
providing
for
reconsignment
have
been
merely
tolerated
and
during
times
of
unquestioned
crisis
--
transportation
crisis,
the
lights
of
which
we
experienced
during
russian
grain
deal,
that
practice
has
not
been
and
should
not
be
tolerated
one
way
against
the
overriding
public
need
to
keep
the
cars
moving
for
all
commodities.
that
leads
me
to
another
point,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
--
my
brother
is
concerned
that
car
service
order
1134
eliminates
the
reconsignment
practice,
it
does
not.
it
during
--
its
duration,
during
the
crisis
limited
the
practice
to
five
working
days
and
it
did
not
eliminate
reconsignment
and
because
it
did
not
eliminate
reconsignment
as
a
marketing
technique,
i
submit
that
the
mechanism
in
1134,
mechanism
for
adjusting
the
needs
of
a
particular
segment
of
the
economy
vis-à-vis
the
overall
economy
must
be
preserved
to
the
commission.
1134,
i
submit,
is
a
careful
accommodation
of
the
public
interest
and
the
interest
of
a
segment
of
the
economy.
the
court
did
not
throw
up
the
particular
accommodation;
the
court
instead
threw
up
the
whole
mechanism.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
which
chronic
problem
do
you
mean,
the
car
shortage
or
the
reconsignment?
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
i
can
report
that
the
commission
has
taken
a
very
significant
and
important
step
just
this
week
i
believe
in
ex
parte
241.
this
court
had
the
earlier
face
of
241,
the
allegheny-ludlum
case.
the
commission
is
exercising
its
authority
which
it
firmly
believes
it
has
to
order
the
nation's
carriers
to
augment
their
boxcar
fleet.
there's
a
motion
to
show
cause
and
a
show
cause
order
outstanding
today
ordering
the
nation's
railroads
to
restore
their
boxcar
fleets
to
the
standards
that
pertain
in
the
1970
to
1972
period.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
it's
--
the
financing
is
a
mixed
problem
because
some
of
the
nation's
railroads
as
you
know,
mr.
justice
brennan,
are
in
the
financial
trouble
but
others
are
not.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
this
applies
uniformly
and
it
is
aimed
at
increasing
the
fleet
by
some
69,000
units
and
reducing
the
bad
order
ratio.
so,
the
commission
has
taken
forceful
steps
and
congress
has
taken
forceful
steps.
there's
legislation
pending
right
now,
the
senate
1149,
looking
towards
financial
aid
from
congress
and
looking
ultimately
towards
the
creation
of
a
national
boxcar
fleet
if
the
financial
doesn't
work.
so,
very
important
strides
are
being
made.
but,
i
think
we
can
predict
with
some
certainty
that
it
will
take
time
and
during
the
time
it
takes,
there
will
be
--
we
can
state
with
a
certainty,
continuations
are
periodic
reoccurrences
of
transportation
emergencies
and
because
we
can
safely
predict
that
transportation
emergencies
will
be
in
our
future,
the
commission
needs
to
have
a
full
array
of
remedial
tools
to
cope
with
emergencies
as
they
come
over
the
horizon.
that
means
it
must
have
a
full
array
of
demurrage
techniques,
it
must
have
a
full
array
of
free
time
limitation
techniques
and
it
must
in
this
particular
instance
preserve
the
technique
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
this
order
was
effective
during
the
--
and
it
worked.
the
first
step
of
the
judicial
review
in
this
case
was
a
tro
hearing
and
which
that
tro
was
denied
and
the
service
order
worked.
it
was
in
effect
from
may
until
the
three-judge
hearing
i
believe
was
in
august
or
september.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
the
emergency
probably
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
i
would
say
given
the
lumber
prices
in
the
housing
industry
that
probably
is
over
now.
but
it
was
the
order
was
alive
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
oh,
well,
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
no
your
honor,
that
was
--
yes,
that
was
a
--
the
part
of
this
tremendous
unexpected
emergency.
but
the
emergency
itself
was
being
exacerbated
by
the
lumber
reconsignment
practices
which
using
the
plaintiff
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
independent
of
but
it
was
an
event
that
could
not
be
tolerated
in
the
face
of
the
overriding
need
to
get
the
cars
moving.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
no,
i
respectfully
would
not
call
them
all
emergency
situations.
you
have
had
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
--
there
were
chronic
shortage
problems
that
is
not
what
i'm
here
talking
about
today,
your
honor.
we're
talking
about
a
--
and
very
unusual
emergency
existing
on
top
of
the
chronic
shortage.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
no,
we
have
--
we're
in
a
period
of
a
chronic
shortage.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
indeed,
we
do
and
that's
one
of
the
reason
why
we
have
to
have
--
the
commission
has
to
have
the
ability
to
order
the
cars
to
be
moved
to
where
they
are
needed
the
most.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
no
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
explain,
if
i
may,
that
what
i'm
talking
about
here
is
a
series
of
car
service
orders
and
the
car
service
order
that
was
aimed
at
an
emergency.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
no,
indeed,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
this
was
an
emergency
on
top
of
the
chronic
shortage,
an
emergency
that
triggered
the
extraordinary
summary
powers
that
the
commission
has.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
the
grain
deal
was
one
segment
of
it
as
i
have
mentioned,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
that's
over.
yes,
indeed.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
the
emergency
that
supported
1134
still
exists
and
that's
totally
consistent
with.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
if
we
prevail,
1134
might
--
1134
is
still
is
in
existence
but
it
has
been
suspended
by
the
court.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
if
we
prevail
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
if
we
prevail,
1134
probably
would
be
terminated
because
of
the
--
beyond
of
the
emergency.
we're
not
here
for
that
simple
reason,
we're
here
to
preserve
a
technique,
a
remedy,
an
adjustment
mechanism
that
might
be
used
in
the
future
and
that
must
be
available
to
the
commission
in
the
future.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
indeed,
i
don't,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
court
recently
looked
that
the
mootness
issue
on
the
defunis
case
but
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
defunis
is
as
the
court
pointed
out
was
the
southern
pacific
terminals
case
versus
icc
which
involved
precisely
the
same
kind
of
order
that
we
have
here
in
the
sense
that
they
were
recurring
short
term
orders
that
could
be
mooted
out,
so
to
speak,
that
could
be
non-effective
by
time
the
courts
cut
mechanism
into
reviewing
them.
we
precisely
have
the
same
situation
here,
we
can
predict
future
emergencies
and
we
can
predict
the
repetition
of
the
same
kind
of
a
question
before
the
courts
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
a
--
and
indeed
if
there
ever
was
a
situation
where
the
exception
to
defunis
applies
that
here
might
have
a
capable
--
initial
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
judicial
review.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
indeed,
it
did
as
to
all
car
service
orders
and
they
last
for
the
--
well,
let
me
just
explain
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
well,
it
originated
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
in
six
weeks
i
believe
the
first
time
around
and
it
was
renewed.
and
this
is
precisely
the
--
it's
a
mechanism
that's
necessary
in
emergency
situations.
at
the
end
of
the
expiration
of
the
duration
of
the
car
service
order,
the
commission
has
compelled
to
again
look
at
the
situation
to
determine
if
the
emergency
still
exists.
if
it
doesn't
still
exists
the
car
service
order
terminates.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes,
it
goes
into
effect
but
it
compel
--
the
commission
will
be
compelled
to
consider
the
underlying
economics
to
see
if
indeed
the
emergency
still
persists
and
if
it
does
not
persist
car
service
order
1134
will
have
done
its
--
well
have
been
terminated
and
will
no
longer
apply.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
the
commission
has
--
time
--
from
time
to
time
extended
the
car
service
order
but
it
had
no
application.
it
extended
it
for
this
reason,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
during
this
period
the
commission
has
been
very
carefully
building
a
record
of
statistics.
if
we
are
successful
today
and
car
service
order
1134
is
reinstated,
it
will
have
the
body
of
information
upon
which
to
make
a
judgment
whether
the
emergency
still
exists
and
more
likely
than
not
will
determine
that
it
does
not
exist
in
car
service
order
will
be
terminated.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
indeed.
it
has
been
renewed
on
that
date
as
renewed
the
second
time
but
of
course
it
was
suspended
by
the
--
was
held
void
ab
initio
by
the
court,
so
it
had
no
effect
other
than
the
commission
has
been
gathering
data
all
during
this
period
and
obviously
we'll
be
forced
or
we'll
take
it
upon
itself
to
reexamine
the
underlying
premises
of
the
car
service
order
at
determination
of
judicial
review.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
it
did
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
it
appears
in
the
federal
register
--
i
can't
cite
you
the
pages
but
when
an
order
is
extended,
it
is
--
a
notice
has
given
to
the
public
by
federal
register
publication.
i
certainly
i
can't
provide
the
court
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
sir?
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
no,
it
isn't
but
i
certainly
can
supply
the
court
with
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
indeed,
i
will,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
the
commission's
judgment,
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
emergency
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
still
exists
and
that
that
judgment
is
subject
to
both
administrative
review
by
way
of
petition
for
reconsideration
and
judicial
review
on
whether
or
not
there
was
indeed
--
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
while
this
matter
is
pending
before
this
court,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
the
order
is
alive
but
suspended.
it
has
not
been
in
effect.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
no
your
honor,
there's
no
reason
why
it
could
not
have.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
h.
white,
jr.
i
suspect
the
commission
would
undertake
a
rule
making
procedure
probably
under
section
15(7)
that
basically
allows
the
commission
to
examine
the
rate
structure.
it
would
be
a
rule
making
proceeding
with
full
notice
and
full
participation
by
the
parties
something
in
line
without
the
proceeding
perhaps
in
ex
parte
241
perhaps
even
indeed
a
sub-numbered
proceeding
in
that
case,
the
case
of
course
that
was
reviewed
here
in
allegheny-ludlum.
the
commission
would
provide
full
due
process
protection
in
any
kind
of
a
overhaul
or
long
term
change
in
the
marketing
practice.
it
--
my
judgment,
it
would
probably
be
something
akin
to
ex
parte
241,
investigation
of
boxcar
adequacy.
