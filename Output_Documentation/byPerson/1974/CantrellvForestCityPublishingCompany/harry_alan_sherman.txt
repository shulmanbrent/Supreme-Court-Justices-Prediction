mr.
harry
alan
sherman
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
court.
may
i
address
myself
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
nature
of
the
case.
this
is
an
invasion
of
privacy
and
may
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it's
an
invasion
of
four
types
of
privacy
in
one
continuous
event
or
series
of
events.
although
this
is
a
contradicted
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
i
believe
i
will
point
out
that
they
are
in
error
and
by
the
brief
of
my
distinguished
and
friendly
opponent.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
briefly
these.
the
silver
bridge,
which
was
a
span
crossing
the
ohio
river
from
point
pleasant,
west
virginia
to
colnago,
ohio
and
owned
by
the
state
of
west
virginia
collapsed
on
december
15,
1967
and
46
persons
lost
their
lives
in
that
disaster.
one
of
the
people
that
was
a
victim
of
the
collapse
was
melvin
aaron
cantrell,
the
deceased
husband
of
margaret
may
cantrell,
the
widow
who
brings
this
action.
none
of
the
seven
children
of
the
cantrell's
was
anywhere
near
the
collapse
of
the
bridge
and
was
not
involved
in
any
of
the
news
story
that
naturally
followed
that
disaster.
the
period
of
time
between
the
collapse
and
the
publication
of
the
story,
feature
article,
not
a
news
story,
was
about
eight
months,
just
a
little
short
of
eight
months.
a
reporter
of
the
plain
dealer
for
city
publishing
companies
paper
and
a
young
photographer
came
to
the
premises
which
incidentally
were
seven
miles
of
a
highway
of
a
main
highway.
they
had
to
cross
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
private
land
to
get
to
the
residents
on
the
day
of
their
visit.
they
were
not
invited.
they
were
not
--
they
did
not
notify
anyone
that
they
were
going
to
come
on
to
the
premises.
they
walked
into
the
living
room
door
when
the
young
fellow,
13
years
old
saw
men
walking
across
there
land
open
the
door
to
look
out
to
see
and
they
walked
right
in.
this
is
the
testimony
of
our
plaintiff's
witnesses;
that
is
david
cantrell
and
the
photographer
conway,
one
of
the
defendants,
admittedly
took
50
pictures.
now
in
an
hour
to
an
hour-and-half,
now
he
took
more
that
didn't
come
up
but
50
that
came
out,
this
is
admitted,
so
he
was
very
busy
taking
pictures.
eszterhas
the
reporter
supposedly
talked
to
the
older
of
the
children
in
the
house.
what
he
said
nobody
knows
because
he
never
showed
up
at
depositions,
although
he
was
noticed
twice.
he
was
not
at
the
trial
and
did
not
testify.
conway
testified
that
he
did
not
ask
any
questions
and
he
said
the
arrangements
for
him
being
in
this
private
residence,
he
presumed
were
made
by
the
city
desk
or
the
reporter,
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
so
that
we
have
nobody
from
the
defense
testifying
as
to
the
contents
of
the
story
which
was
a
feature
story.
admittedly,
several
pages
of
a
sunday
supplement
magazine
section
of
the
paper
with
a
little
over
400,000
in
circulation,
several
of
this
photographs
that
were
taken
like
conway
on
the
visit
were
rather
large.
they're
in
exhibit
ii
accompanied
the
article
and
showed
that
children
all
in
the
very,
very
pathetic
like,
all
bear
foot,
all
dirty
bedraggled,
all
at
home,
the
mother
wasn't
there.
the
mother
had
not
known
that
anyone
was
to
come
to
their
premises,
did
not
invite
anybody,
did
not
agree
to
any
interview
of
her
children
age
two
to
16
at
that
time,
and
they
were
told
immediately
that
is
the
reporter
and
photographer
as
they
walked
into
the
living
room
that
mother
wasn't
there,
they
didn't
know
when
she
would
be
back
and
the
story
was
written
as
if
on
interviewing
mrs.
cantrell,
even
describing
her
pathetic
appearance
which
is
completely
fictionalized.
they
were
a
great
number
of
false
statements
in
the
article.
now,
of
course
it
so
and
aroused
the
community
that
there
was
an
article
printed
in
a
dayton
publication
exposing
the
fallacies,
the
falseness
of
the
article
that
was
printed
in
the
plain
dealer.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
no,
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
it
was
a
dayton
paper
however
that
wrote
this
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
the
story
about
the
community's
reaction
to
the
article,
and
that's
an
evidence
if
your
honor
please
in
volume
ii.
so
that
the
suit
was
brought
as
an
invasion
of
privacy
action,
and
of
course
the
issues
presented
briefly
are
these.
i
set
them
forth
in
more
detail
in
my
brief,
but
first,
when
we
when
into
trial,
it
was
made
clear
that
we
were
not
trying
a
defamation
or
libel
suit.
we
were
trying
an
invasion
of
privacy
which
incidentally
involved
also
a
publication,
and
judge
krupansky
made
it
very
clear
that
it
was
not
only
the
false
like
publication
which
was
the
basis
of
this
action
that
page
99
of
the
volume
i
of
the
appendix
at
the
top
of
the
page,
district
judge
krupansky
said
it
is
the
conduct
of
the
parties
prior
to
and
at
the
time
of
the
incident
that
gives
rise
to
the
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
your
honor
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
he
was
really,
not
so
sure
as
to
what
the
law
he
had
to
apply
in
view
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
but
he
did
apply
time
versus
hill
because
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
as
long
i
got
to
the
jury
in
that
court,
i
didn't
object
to
anything.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes
your
honor.
we
--
on
special
verdicts
suggested
by
mr.
warder,
i
was
not
even
pres
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes,
yes.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes,
reckless,
disregard
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
as
the
only
basis
for
our
recovery
and
the
jury
found
that
it
was
so.
now
your
honor
it's
very
important
--
in
the
first
place,
i
want
to
tell
you
the
issues
first
and
then
come
back
if
you
don't
mind
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
second
issue
is
this
–
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
well
your
honor,
judge
krupansky
found
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
these
children
were
too
young
to
know
whether
they
were
hurt,
whether
they
have
any
interpersonal
feelings
about
the
invasion
of
their
privacy,
and
therefore
since
we
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
william
--
david
william
was
13
at
that
time
and
he
testified
how
he
was
hurt
your
honor,
the
others
were
too
young
to
testify.
so,
he
was
actually
a
witness
in
the
case
and
i
think
a
critical
witness.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes.
she
was
17
and
he
just
--
she
was
--
he
left
them
out
and
i
was
afraid
to
argue
and
carry
that
point
up
because
on
the
question
of
damages
and
what's
be
strictly
a
real
seriously
legal
question
in
our
minds.
i
discussed
it
with
margaret
cantrell.
we
decided
to
let
well
enough
alone
without
clouding
the
record
of
the
issue
on
any
other
aspect
of
the
case.
we
were
not
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury
on
punitive
damages
which
i
felt
we
might
well
go
on
the
basis
of
the
trespass,
preceding
the
publication.
however
in
view
of
the
judge's
as
strong
feelings
that
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
all
the
other
cases
that
came
down
since
then
that
once
it's
published,
we're
running
into
freedom
of
the
press
as
expanded
by
the
supreme
court's
decisions
and
there
was
--
he
was
weary
of
allowing
us
to
go
into
any
punitive
damages.
so,
we
were
confined
of
actual
damages
and
the
jury
verdict
was
$60,000.00,
45
for
the
mother;
15
for
the
boy.
the
next
issue
that
i'm
raising
is
in
such
a
case
where
we
are
really
basing
our
concept
of
the
case
on
the
supreme
court
decisions,
especially
in
katz
versus
united
states
where
this
is
--
we
have
the
evolving
law
of
privacy
at
the
state
level,
and
we
are
on
a
diversity
basis.
aren't
we
entitled
to
a
seventh
amendment
right
to
jury
trial
to
make
a
determination
of
the
issues
of
fact?
and
that's
one
of
the
issues
that
i
raise
on
the
appeal,
and
the
last
one
--
and
this
one,
i
think
is
devastating
when
the
sixth
circuit
says
that
when
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
right
of
privacy
admitted
and
the
freedom
of
the
press,
the
right
of
privacy
must
give
way
to
freedom
of
the
press
because
right
of
privacy
is
mentioned
in
the
constitution,
and
freedom
of
the
press
is,
this
is
the
wording
of
the
court.
so
that
that's
another
issue
that
i
raise
and
i
believe
in
all
fairness
to
my
opponent,
i
should
tell
you
the
issues
as
the
respondents
have
raised
them.
first
of
all
in
their
brief
in
opposition
to
the
grant
of
certiorari,
they
raise
one
question,
should
certiorari
be
granted
in
an
action
for
invasion
of
privacy
based
upon
the
publication
of
an
article
concerning
a
matter
of
public
interest
where
the
lower
courts
correctly
applied
the
constitutional
standard
in
accordance
with
the
controlling
cases
of
this
court,
and
where
the
lower
courts
found
no
evidence
of
known
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth?
now,
that's
not
the
exactly
what
the
court
found.
the
court
found
no
malice.
the
jury
found
that
there
was
a
reckless
disregard,
but
then
in
their
brief,
they
say
very
simply,
does
the
first
amendment
protect
publication
of
a
non-defamatory
newsworthy
article
from
a
claim
for
false
light
invasion
of
privacy
absent
proof
of
calculated
falsehood?
now
your
honors,
i
point
out
that
no
one
decided
that
there
was
any
newsworthy
where
article
here.
although
the
sixth
circuit
points
out
that
the
difficulty
for
courts
in
deciding
what's
newsworthy
saying
that
the
editors,
the
publishers
should
primarily
be
the
judges
as
to
what
the
newsworthy.
but
the
editors
and
publishers
in
this
case
not
one
word
was
spoken
in
evidence
or
anywhere
in
pleadings
that
this
was
newsworthy.
it
wasn't
newsworthy.
there
was
no
news
article,
no
news
event.
they
admitted
it
was
a
creative
feature
article
written
by
a
smart
young
writer
who
made
good
copy
and
that's
all
it
was
to
it.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
may
i
respectfully
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
was
a
newspaperman
and
an
editor
for
16
years,
and
may
i
respectfully
say
sir
that
that
is
just
not
the
way
they
look
at
it.
feature
articles
are
completely
one
category
of
publication
with
all
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
rights
to
feature
articles
and
the
creative
literature;
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
newsworthy?
no
your
honor.
there
is
a
definition
of
news
and
there
is
a
definition
of
newsworthiness
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
made
that
definition
very
clear
as
i
point
out
my
reply
brief
if
your
honor
please
in
the
classic
case
that
it
was
decided
here
between
international
news
service
and
associated
press.
there
was
a
definition;
news
belongs
to
the
public,
news
is
not
the
property
of
anyone
and
the
feature
articles
are
protected,
literally
writings
are
protected,
copyright
laws
and
all
the
other
things
that
go
along
with
it.
we
have
very
definite
distinction
in
the
field
of
journalism
as
between
editorials,
news,
feature
articles,
so
that
--
and
entertainment
and
other
features
of
a
publication.
now
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
the
broad
basic
constitutional
right
does
not
apply
to
all,
but
as
far
as
news
is
concerned,
i
think
that
the
primarily
purpose
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
protect
the
public's
right
to
know
events
and
shape
their
thinking
and
judgments
in
accordance
with
the
events
that
shape
the
news
so
to
speak.
now
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes
your
honor.
yes,
there's
a
--
i'm
sorry.
there's
a
reply
brief
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
immediately.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
but
a
week
after
i
got
their
brief.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
mr.
chief
justice,
ideally,
it
certainly
should
be
ideally,
practically,
i'm
the
attorney
also
that's
trying
the
silver
bridge
death
cases
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
and
they
got
a
new
bridge,
but
that's
over
the
hill,
and
now
they're
just
on
with
regular
business.
they
don't
--
these
things
are
not
remembered.
the
rights,
if
any,
must
be
intact
in
the
judicial
process
or
--
they're
forgotten
until
another
tragedy
occurs.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
if
they
write
this
way,
if
they
write
the
way
these
fellows
did,
no,
because
they're
calling
him
hill
billy's
people
that
had
nothing
to
live
for
anyway.
they
had
wives
and
children,
but
that's
all
they
had,
that's
quote
from
the
article.
hill
billy's
bury
their
dead,
the
hill
folk
bury
their
dead,
and
to
us
--
to
a
cleveland
audience
to
metropolitan
audience
outside
the
hills
of
west
virginia,
no
your
honor.
i
respectfully
say
that
the
history
of
these
things
show
that
interest,
this
personal
interest
is
the
curiosity
of
the
satisfying
of
one's
own
reading
appetites
but
not
in
doing
anything
to
protect
the
poor
folk
that
were
the
victims
of
the
tragedy
of
this
sort.
we
have
to
depend
on
justice,
not
history
to
correct
its
own
errors,
and
especially
when
we
have
to
look
to
political
changes
in
order
to
affect
such
history.
we
can't
wait
for
the
democratic
process
to
enlighten
all
our
populous
that
serves
on
juries
for
example.
but
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
i
went
perhaps
beyond
in
my
philosophical
statement
to
add
on
this
question.
nothing
of
that
sort
specifically
was
brought
into
the
case
as
such
except
in
the
answer
where
they
did
raise
public
interest
as
one
of
the
privilege
basis
for
printing,
okay?
now,
there's
no
question
that
there
could
be
a
legitimate
public
interest
in
the
truth
and
i
would
subscribe
to
that
of
course.
there
might
be
a
very,
very
definite
way
of
actual
interviewing
mrs.
cantrell.
the
interesting
thing
in
this
case
is
that
the
reporter
who
never
showed
up
to
explain
why
he
went
there
uninvited
and
a
new
theory
was
interjected
on
the
trial.
this
absent
reporter
all
of
a
sudden
becomes
a
man
who
is
free
lancing.
now,
there
was
no
affirmative
defense
that
there
was
no
employment.
there
was
an
admission
that
there
were
unemployment
in
the
answer,
then,
all
of
a
sudden
on
trial,
he's
free
lancing
to
separate
the
publication
on
the
publisher
from
the
illegitimate
trespass
of
the
reporter.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
because
your
honor,
because
your
honor
i
happened
to
have
taken
the
deposition
of
conway
who
clearly
--
well,
he
talk
one
way
in
court,
but
the
deposition
just
destroyed
his
credibility
because
he
said
he
got
authority
from
the
city
desk,
and
he
was
working
as
--
he
was
taking
pictures
not
for
eszterhas,
but
as
photographer
for
the
plain
dealer;
that's
what
he
was
doing
there.
and
therefore
your
honor,
a
credibility
was
an
important
element
in
the
determination
of
the
jury,
and
that's
of
course
i
think
fact
finding
as
to
--
is
for
the
jury
as
my
--
a
very
strong
and
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
of
course
your
honor.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
right.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
there
was
a
district
court
denial
of
our
right
to
punitive
damage
on
the
basis
of
no
malice
and
all,
that
is
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
no,
it
didn't
say.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes.
well
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
except
in
time
versus
hill,
you
would
have
only
the
publication
had
no
invasion,
no
trespass,
no
--
nothing
like
that
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
no,
he
does
make
such
a
finding.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
it's
in
the
printed
record
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
a
hundred
and
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes
your
honor,
that's
exactly
it
is.
in
other
words,
whether
it
does
harm
or
not
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
--
unless
you
can
prove
that
there
was
some
motivation
to
do
harm,
no
malice
as
such.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
well,
there
is
no
such
finding
and
may
i
–-
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
within
the
legal
definition
of
that
term.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
that's
about
the
extent
of
the
quotation
within
the
legal
definition
of
that
term.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
he
made
no
such
finding
your
honor.
it's
absolutely
no
such
finding.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
and
i'm
sorry
i
can't
--
i
was
sure
i
had
that
everything
cataloged,
but
i
just
can't
find
it
quickly
enough.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes
your
honor.
this
is
--
the
total
a
trial
is
in
volume
i.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
except
volume
ii
exhibit,
that's
right.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes
your
honor,
and
there's
--
you'll
find
that
this
was
a
case
that
was
right
down
of
the
bone,
there
was
no
fan
on
it.
it
simply
had
to
--
we
had
to
avoid
the
arguments
on
what
whether
the
judge
said
this
is
it,
this
is
harmless
and
letting
it
go
to
the
jury
and
only
this
--
alright,
what
am
i
going
to
do?
anyway
your
honors,
i
feel
that
there
is
one
thing
that
really
has
to
be
aired,
and
that
is
this.
the
second
issue
that
is
raised
by
the
opponents
that
mrs.
cantrell
in
effect
waived
the
trespass,
there
is
no
such
thing.
she
was
asked
a
specific
question
by
my
distinguished
friend
here
at
page
35
of
the
record.
in
cross-examination,
he
said
--
the
sixth
circuit
says
that
she
said
these
things,
but
it
isn't,
it's
in
the
question,
that's
a
double
question
and
this
is
a
woman,
remotely
hills
of
west
virginia
without
any
education.
so
isn't
it
fair
to
say
mrs.
cantrell
that
you
objected
to
the
plain
dealer
article
not
because
of
the
publicity,
but
because
of
what
it
said?
answer,
yes
sir.
now,
which
question
is
you
saying
yes
sir
to?
there's
only
one
--
the
publicity
is
the
article
and
what
it
says
is
the
article,
yes
sir.
and
they
say
because
he
implies
that
she
didn't
object
to
the
publicity
as
distinguished
from
the
article
that
therefore
that
was
somehow
a
waiver
of
the
trespass,
and
the
sixth
circuit
says
specifically
that
the
man
might
have
been
guilty
of
a
trespass,
but
the
case
went
to
the
jury
only
as
a
false
light
trespass
on
the
publication;
it
did
not.
page
102-103,
as
well
as
99
which
i
pointed
to
your
honors
before,
the
case
went
to
the
jury
as
total
package.
all
the
evidence
went
in
on
the
basis
of
the
intrusion
of
this
young
man
into
the
home
without
any
explanation
or
justification.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
yes.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
both,
they're
the
same.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
it's
admitted
that
they
were
the
same.
and
of
course
now,
there
is
at
this
point
especially
since
your
honors
have
decided
the
gertz
case
and
i
studied
that
in
it’s
totality
because
i
am
learning
as
everybody
else
is
learning
in
the
united
states,
especially
your
lower
court
judges
as
to
where
we
go
from
here
on
some
of
these
cases
which
the
common
law
is
always
made
rather
solid.
i
want
you
to
know
that
we
got
exactly
and
[laughter
attempt]
only
what
was
granted
as
a
compensatory
award
for
paying
something.
here,
we
have
three
years
after
the
event,
mrs.
cantrell
is
in
the
court
room
and
she
is
asked
about
the
effect
on
the
children,
they
come
home
crying
and
so
forth
and
she
is
embarrassed,
everywhere
she
turns
and
how
long
did
that
go
on?
it
still
goes
on
three
years
later.
now,
that
a
400
and
some
thousand
publication
of
a
newspaper
and
these
remote
people,
you
can't
get
anymore
private
on
the
hills
of
west
virginia
if
your
honors
please.
and
here
is
a
family
that
had
enough
tragedy
in
its
life,
and
she
has
problems
raising
seven
children
and
she
is
doing
well,
very,
very
proud
lady
and
working
as
waitress
in
the
restaurant
and
doing
well,
asking
nothing
of
anybody,
refusing
welfare
and
so
forth.
and
while
she
is
away
at
work,
her
family
is
intruded
upon
and
is
exposed,
hung
up
to
dry
because
some
young
enterprising
creative
fiction
writer
decided
to
make
a
microcosm
out
of
the
cantrell
family's
experience
for
all
the
world
to
believe
that
all
of
the
families
had
the
same
result.
now
may
i
in
closing
just
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
very
important
case,
stanford
versus
states
of
texas,
where
the
supreme
court
points
out
very
definitely
the
history
of
how
we
got
personal
liberty
before
the
constitution,
how
we
got
privacy
before
the
constitution
and
the
two
english
cases.
and
here
which
wiped
out
writs
of
assistance
and
similar
warrants
that
gave
broad
authority
to
the
ages
ago
into
any
body’s
home
and
search
for
evidence
and
to
deny
any
privacy
to
anybody,
and
here
where
the
sixth
circuit
court
in
1974
cowed
by
what
the
law
had
become
under
the
confusion
following
the
new
york
times
versus
sullivan.
i
respectfully
say
that
was
only
that
granting
a
license
to
private
reporters
and
photographers,
the
second
word
is
even
more
ominous
than
the
first,
to
do
the
same
thing
that
was
wiped
out
200
years
ago
before
we
became
a
nation
and
let
them
have
any
access
without
any
answerability
in
damages
in
the
court
of
law
in
the
united
states.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
just
if
your
honor
please,
i
want
to
point
out
that
my
friend's
statement
on
the
alarm
situation.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
denial
of
the
falsity.
plaintiff's
case
went
down
the
line
to
prove
that
the
articles,
as
the
contents
of
the
article
were
false,
absolutely
false.
there
was
no
denial
of
anything
that
we
said
was
false.
secondly,
at
page
102,
103
--
mr.
harry
alan
sherman
no
your
honor.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
but
when
he
argued
that
somehow
or
rather
that
if
they
publish
a
story,
there
the
editor
can't
be
held
for
falsity.
they
didn't
deny
it
was
false.
secondly,
that
judge
krupansky
told
the
jury
that
if
they
found,
they
had
to
find
that
the
trespass
and
the
actions
of
conway
and
eszterhas
were
within
the
scope
of
their
employment
that
they
were
sent
there
rather
than
they
did
it
on
their
own
at
page
102,
103.
so
i
wanted
to
just
point
that
out
your
honor
and
thank
you
very
much.
