mr.
alan
latman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
action
for
copyright
infringement
against
the
united
states
government.
it
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
it's
brought
under
the
provisions
of
title
28
united
states
code
section
1498(b)
which
is
an
eminent
domain
type
of
statute
passed
by
congress
15
years
ago
to
cover
cases
of
this
type.
and
the
exclusive
remedy
of
that
statute
is
an
action
in
the
court
of
claims
for
reasonable
compensation,
therefore
there's
no
injunction
possible
in
this
case
nor
is
any
sought.
the
issue
is
whether
the
government
system
of
reproducing
petitioner's
copyrighted
journal
articles
in
their
entirety
through
library
photocopying
is
compensable
under
this
jurisdictional
statute
as
copyright
infringement
or
excusable
under
the
defense
of
fair
use.
petitioner
believes
that
this
issue
vitally
affects
the
future
of
journal
such
as
its
medical
and
scientific
journals
involved
in
this
case
ranging
to
journals
of
political
affairs,
poetry,
literary
journals
which
have
a
small
circulation,
privately
published
and
respected.
petitioner
also
believes
that
this
issue
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
compensation
because
its
property,
namely
its
copyrights,
has
been
taken
and
it
should
be
reasonably
compensated.
i
say
taken
because
the
government
system
of
furnishing
reproductions
here
come
within
the
policy
and
the
language
of
the
copyright
statute
which
provides
exclusive
rights
to
print,
reprint,
publish
and
copy.
and
the
defense
of
fair
use
is
completely
inapplicable
as
i'll
indicate
in
a
moment.
that's
a
doctrine
and
a
defense
that
applies
to
an
incidental
use
by
one
writer
of
someone
else's
work
in
terms
of
a
portion
of
the
work
but
never
so
as
to
constitute
an
effective
substitute
for
the
original
work.
in
this
case
--
mr.
alan
latman
i
don't
believe
it
has,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
doctrine
was
raised
in
the
so-called
jack
benny
case
which
did
reach
this
court
and
it
was
a
case
which
held
that
a
taking
of
someone
else's
work
either
even
as
a
parity
constituted
infringement,
that
was
a
ninth
circuit
case.
the
affirmance
by
this
court
was
four
to
four
of
necessity
and
without
opinion.
the
issue
also
was
raised
in
a
case
involving
admiral
richover
where
mr.
justice
reed,
who
was
then
retired
was
sitting
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
he
had
some
remarks
to
say
about
fair
use
which
we
do
quote
in
our
brief
which
we
think
are
pertinent,
basically
that
taking
a
whole
work
has
never
been
held
to
be
fair
use
but
when
it
came
to
this
court,
the
judgment
was
vacated
for
an
insufficient
record
on
other
issues.
so
i
think
the
answer
to
the
question
has
to
be
no.
mr.
alan
latman
yes
it
is
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
alan
latman
that's
correct,
it
was
--
mr.
benny
put
on
what
he
called
auto
light
as
a
parity
of
gas
light.
he
had
the
same
star,
ingrid
bergman
and
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
even
though
parity
changed
the
serious
melodrama
of
gas
light
to
a
comity,
nevertheless,
the
defense
of
fair
use
did
not
apply.
nevertheless
it
was
infringement.
mr.
alan
latman
yes
your
honor.
the
learning
of
those
cases
is
that
the
essence
of
fair
use
is
that
it
should
not
--
the
use
should
not
be
an
effective
substitute.
in
this
case,
when
we're
dealing
with
a
photocopy
of
a
40
or
50
page
article,
we
think
it's
unquestionable
that
that
does
substitute
for
the
original.
the
trial
judge
held
for
the
petitioner
on
the
issue
of
liability,
reserving
the
amount
of
reasonable
compensation
for
later
determination.
the
court
of
claims
in
a
four
to
three
decision
disagreed
and
dismissed
the
petition.
the
government
agencies
involved
are
two
libraries
of
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare.
one
is
the
national
library
of
medicine,
which
is
a
library's
library.
it
sits
at
the
apex
of
a
nationwide
network
of
10
regional
and
400
local
medical
libraries.
mr.
alan
latman
they
vary,
your
honor.
they
include
not
only
other
government
libraries
and
medical
schools
and
institutions
but
also
private
companies
including
drug
companies
for
example,
and
the
service
that
the
national
library
of
medicine
renders
to
this
variety
of
constituents
is
the
same.
and
that
service
is,
that
they
take
a
few
subscriptions
as
does
the
sister
library,
the
national
institutes
of
health
or
nih.
nih
is
a
--
as
your
honors
know
here,
in
bethesda
it's
a
super
library
and
it's
a
super
institution,
it
furnishes
its
thousands
of
employees
with
their
needs
for
journals,
subscribing
to
only
one
or
two
copies.
now
concededly,
these
copies
don't
do
the
job
by
themselves
so
as
an
integral
part
of
the
operations
of
both
libraries,
there
is
a
system
of
the
following.
when
a
patron
or
the
staff
wants
a
journal,
he
or
she
gets
a
complete
photocopy
of
the
article.
it's
complete,
it's
no
return,
it's
free.
i
say
free,
i
mean
there's
no
charge.
of
course
it
costs
the
taxpayer
money
indeed
the
government
pays
the
xerox
corporation
for
each
page
they
copy
and
of
course
they
do
not
pay
the
people
who
produce
and
disseminate
the
material
being
copied.
mr.
alan
latman
the
practice
of
individuals,
libraries?
mr.
alan
latman
was
namely
to
take
notes
by
hand
and
then
in
the
turn
of
the
century
and
in
the
going
up
to
the
thirties,
there
was
the
system
of
photostats
and
rather
elaborate
system
of
dark
room
facilities
which
meant
that
until
you
got
to
the
era
of
xerox,
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
had
a
situation
where
it
was
impracticable
and
uneconomical
and
slow
to
reproduce
an
entire
article.
and
that's
why
we
think
that
all
those
methods,
hand,
typewriter,
mimeograph,
whatever
the
system
was,
it
was
a
system
geared
to
taking
notes
as
we
all
do,
making
an
excerpt
or
taking
a
photostat
of
one
page
or
a
chart
whereas
the
era
of
xerox,
which
the
party
seem
to
admit
really
came
in
the
early
60's,
to
think
that
the
opinion
below
and
the
government's
brief
here
and
the
government's
brief
below
concedes
the
fact
that
in
the
early
60's,
late
50's,
there
was
virtually
no
photocopying
as
we
know
it
today.
mr.
alan
latman
no,
i
don't
believe
the
record
is
conclusive
one
way
or
another.
i
don't
think
i
could
say
they
subscribed
to
more,
however,
we
have
a
few
sequels
really,
one
is
this,
that
in
certain
areas,
for
example
one
of
the
journals
ensued
is
called
journal
of
immunology.
i
suppose
we
all
recognize
that
in
the
era
of
transplants,
in
the
era
of
cancer
research
and
the
like,
that
the
interest
in
immunology
has
so
mushroomed
that
for
subscriptions
to
stay
about
the
same,
which
in
many
cases
they
have,
or
for
reprints
which
is
an
alternative
form
that
the
publisher
has,
now
as
the
publisher
doesn't
only
sell
subscription.
publisher
is
interested
in
disseminating
this
material,
that's
what
it's
in
the
business
of
doing.
so
that
in
addition
to
subscriptions,
it
sells
reprints,
it
licenses
microfilm
which
is
another
convenient
alternative
form
of
utilization
and
indeed,
it
has
an
authorized
photocopying
agency.
so
that
these
alternative
forms
which
are
needed
to
keep
these
very
small
base
journals
alive,
for
example
take
medicine
or
journal
of
immunology,
there
are
four
journals
ensued
and
even
though
everyone
agrees
these
are
the
respected
journals
in
their
fields
in
the
world,
the
journals
that
have
subscriptions
from
three
to
seven
thousand.
the
subscription
price
for
six
or
12
issues
are
$12.00
or
$44.00.
the
national
library
of
medicine
in
achieving
this,
has
a
system
of
an
overhead
microfilm
camera
which
swings
up
and
down
the
aisles
of
the
stocks
of
the
library
to
take
photographs
of
the
journals.
now
there
is
one,
does
not
even
have
to
bring
the
journal
out.
and
i
mentioned
that
only
to
indicate
that
this
is
an
integral
day-by-day
operation.
similarly,
national
institute
of
health
have
four
employees
who
do
nothing
else
all
day
but
grind
out
these
reprints
and
in
the
year
in
question,
in
the
record,
it
shows
that
that
operation
at
nih
with
those
four
full
time
employees,
entails
an
expenditure
of
slightly
more
than
the
library
spent
for
acquisition
of
journals.
the
product
--
mr.
alan
latman
it
does,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
shows
that
on
the
average,
about
300
reprints
are
furnished.
mr.
alan
latman
no,
there
is
a
certain
amount
that’s
free
of
charge,
25
or
so
and
the
rest
are
purchased.
now
they're
purchased
and
of
course
the
amount
of
reprints
that
were
purchased
in
the
past
used
to
be
an
indication
of
the
popularity
of
the
articles,
something
that
the
editors
are
interested
in
but
it
isn't
anymore
and
we
think
the
reason
that
it
isn't
anymore
is
that
once
the
reprints
which
are
furnished
by
the
author
to
people
who
request
it
are
used
up
that
the
people
just
photocopy.
mr.
alan
latman
we
don't
think
there's
any
barriers,
we
think
that
--
but
in
order
to
facilitate
the
situation,
because
in
the
past
it
is
hard
to
stock
actual
back
copies.
our
client
has
authorized
to
reprint
houses
to
furnish
reprints
and
secondly
as
i
indicated,
a
photocopying
agency
to
furnish
people
with
that.
so
that
while
there
may
be
a
barrier,
we
think
that
the
key
is
authorized
photocopying
because
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
in
this
situation,
the
petitioner
is
not
interested
in
stopping
or
slowing
down
or
halting
this
photocopying
at
all.
what
the
proprietor
is
interested
in
doing
is
securing
some
reasonable
royalty.
therefore
mr.
chief
justice,
we
think
that
working
through
our
licensed
representative
is
one
way.
if
one
would
consider
that
that's
too
slow
and
that
that's
a
barrier,
then
the
alternative
which
we
would
prefer
and
which
we've
offered
is
a
blanket
license
covering
all
the
journal
articles
which
could
be
paid
for
by
the
library
when
they
buy
the
subscription.
and
so
far,
that's
all
proposals
that
we
made
have
been
turned
down
because
as
our
efforts
show,
when
we
try
to
setup
such
a
system
before
the
lawsuit,
we
were
told
that
there
would
be
no
system
of
royalties
until
a
court
ordered
the
government
to
do
so.
mr.
alan
latman
well
we've
had
almost
a
worst
experience,
mr.
justice
white
and
that
we
almost
run
into
a
boycott
and
i
think
i've
appended
to
our
brief
in
our
experience.
the
national
library
of
medicine
is
after
all
a
well-respected
agency.
we
respect
it
greatly
ourselves.
when
it's
suggested
that
any
proposal
to
license
during
dependency
of
this
suit
was
somehow
inelegant
and
improper,
the
national
library
of
medicine
threatened
to,
not
only
not
take
our
license
but
to
cease
subscribing
to
the
journals,
that's
of
record.
and
when
i
say
a
record,
i
mean
it's
in
a
letter
which
the
government
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
which
we
thought
would
be
helpful
if
we
appended
in
full.
the
private
libraries
indicated
that
they
would
follow
soon.
of
course
the
licenses
that
we
are
talking
about
would
extend
to
private
libraries.
the
government
in
effect
has
a
compulsory
license
in
this
case,
as
the
court
knows.
we
can't
stop
the
government,
we
don't
want
to.
but
the
offer
of
licensing
has
been
extended
but
we
were
told
that
we
better
not
extend
licenses
or
talk
about
licenses
until
there
was
a
definitive
word
on
this
case
and
that's
why
we're
here.
mr.
alan
latman
yes.
mr.
alan
latman
mr.
chief
justice,
their
practice
is
in
direct
and
dramatic
contrast
to
the
libraries
in
question.
they
have
a
policy
which
was
introduced
into
evidence.
the
library
of
congress
photo
duplication,
the
key
to
which
is
copyright
material
will
ordinarily
not
be
copied
without
the
signed
authorization
of
the
copyright
owner.
exceptions
to
this
rule
may
be
made
in
particular
cases
or
responsibility
for
uses
on
the
applier.
in
other
words
we
find
that
dramatically
different
and
we
suspect
that
it's
different
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
libraries
purport
to
have
limitations,
that
is
that
respect
for
the
law,
respect
for
the
rights
of
property
and
copyright,
particularly
in
these
journals.
mr.
alan
latman
does
--
what
apply,
mr.
justice
marshall?
mr.
alan
latman
i
believe
it
does,
i
don't
know
of
any
exceptions
to
their
policy,
on
the
other
hand
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
practice
with
regard
to
member
of
congress.
of
course
the
purpose
of
the
statute
that
we're
sewing
on
is
to
immunize
individuals
within
the
government
and
to
make
the
government
liable
for
government
use
which
might
possibly
cover
the
--
mr.
alan
latman
not
the
national
library
of
medicine.
mr.
alan
latman
yes
we
think
that
they
should
pay
for
it
just
as
they
pay
for
the
subscriptions
they
buy,
just
as
they
pay
for
the
microfilm
additions,
all
of
which
are
alternative
ways
to
use
the
journals,
alternative
ways
to
use
it
within
the
meaning
of
the
copyright
law
which
provides
for
exclusive
rights
to
print,
reprint
and
copy.
we
think
it's
a
copy
and
we
think
that
it
fulfills
the
policy
of
the
copyright
law
which
is
to
grant
economic
incentives
to
publishers.
mr.
alan
latman
no,
what
they
could
do
is
to
take
a
license
and
pay
literally
a
few
more
dollars
a
year
in
order
to
get
--
mr.
alan
latman
no,
no
the
proposal
that
we
--
mr.
alan
latman
excuse
me?
mr.
alan
latman
well,
the
proposal
that
we
talked
about,
which
we
had
to
withdraw
under
the
threat
of
boycott
that
i
indicated,
averaged
about
$3.65
a
year
for
the
library,
for
the
life
of
that
particular
journal.
that
would
mean
that
they
could
furnish
each
and
every
one
of
their
users
with
a
copy.
mr.
alan
latman
well
it
would
vary.
the
amounts
we're
talking
about
are
small
but
important.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
medicine,
the
subscription
price
is
$12.00
a
year.
the
libraries
probably
account
for
most
of
the
subscribers
or
half
of
the
subscribers
so
it
would
amount
to
perhaps
$10,000.00
a
year
to
the
publisher
which
in
terms
of
medicine,
whose
gross
revenues
maybe
$50,000.00
mr.
alan
latman
that's
all
it
would
bring
in
if
it
were
accepted.
mr.
alan
latman
no,
we're
talking
about
more,
mr.
justice
marshall
because
--
mr.
alan
latman
well
it's
hard
to
put
a
specific
dollars
and
cents
tag
on
it.
the
reason
i
say
--
first
of
all
i
would
like
to
say
that
$10,000.00
to
the
life
of
a
journal
is
extremely
important.
but
passing
that,
the
petitioner
publishes,
for
example
37
journals
and
what
we
are
talking
about
other
people
as
i
indicated
before,
i
do
not
have
an
estimate
for
you
mr.
justice
marshall,
on
how
much
would
be
involved
if
that
particular
license
proposal
of
ours
was
achieved.
we
weren't
indicated
that
we're
completely
open
to
any
variation
of
a
licensing
proposal.
they
do
pay
xerox
corporation
as
i
said
per
page
but
we
think
per
page
is
perhaps
a
little
too
complicated.
mr.
alan
latman
to
begin
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
a
person
in
a
similar
situation,
of
course
suing
the
government
has
no
alternative
and
the
government
is
very
important
subscriber
and
a
very
important
factor
here.
but
secondly
we
think
that
if
the
court
of
claims
did
what
we
think
is
its
proper
job,
namely
to
decide
reasonable
compensation
in
this
case,
and
this
might
even
give
a
hint
as
to
what
the
answer
might
be
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
that
this
would
serve
as
a
pilot
example
to
people
as
to
what
reasonable
compensation
would
be.
i've
seen
no
indication
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
publishers
including
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
who
have
joined
as
amicus
in
this
action,
of
any
interest
to
stop
this
photocopy
so
that
i
think
that
if
they
went
in
to
court,
and
let's
say
went
into
a
private
into
court
against
the
private
individual,
that
the
standard
set
by
the
court
of
claims
in
this
case
would
show
what
reasonableness
would
be
and
that's
what
we
would
urge.
mr.
alan
latman
well
it's
been
open
for
congressional
regulation,
mr.
justice
white
for
many
years.
i
think
the
court
became
aware
of
that
in
the
60’s.
i'm
going
to
say
that
i
spent
a
very
pleasant
year
of
my
life
at
the
copyright
office
in
1958
across
the
street.
at
the
early
days
of
the
revision,
i
used
to
take
good
lunch
hours
here
listening
to
the
arguments
in
this
court
and
i'm
still
waiting
and
i
think
the
court
is
still
waiting
for
action.
but
i
think
more
important
than
that
is
that
the
court
of
claims
has
really
legislated.
the
court
of
claims
ignored
the
fair
use
doctrine
completely
and
in
a
sense,
if
you
read
their
three
core
propositions,
what
they
said
was
we
think
it
might
hurt
this
fellow
more
than
that
fellow.
we
think
they
were
wrong
and
we
show
that
and
we
believe
in
our
brief.
but
we
think
that
it's
important
that
this
is
a
judge
made
doctrine
and
that
the
fair
use
question,
as
we've
indicated
in
some
detail
in
our
brief,
even
if
the
most
recent
movement,
i
was
going
to
say
gesture
which
is
unfair
and
disrespectful
but
i
mean
the
most
recent
movement
in
congress
towards
revision
were
to
become
law
that
the
fair
use
question
before
this
court
would
still
be
with
us.
and
the
reason
it
would
be
is
that
the
government
argues
that
the
fair
use
doctrine
excuses
whereas
they
admit
that
this
case
is
different
from
any
case
in
which
the
fair
use
doctrine
has
been
applied
in
the
past.
we
agree
with
that
the
fair
use
doctrine
deals
with
incidental
use
as
i
indicated
earlier
where
the
key
question
in
every
case
is
does
it
substitute.
if
a
fellow
writing
a
biography
of
howard
hughes,
decides
to
borrow
from
an
earlier
work
on
the
same
subject
and
his
work
wouldn't
substitute
for
your
getting
and
reading
the
original,
he
is
and
was
in
the
rosemund
case
held
to
be
using
it
fairly
and
i
agree.
but
where
a
high
school
teacher
instead
of
buying
copies,
makes
his
own
arrangement
and
reproduces
48
copies
for
his
students,
something
which
is
indistinguishable
from
the
situation
here.
he's
held
infringing.
the
reason
i
say
indistinguishable
is
that
the
libraries
speak
about
one
at
a
time
that
they
only
furnish
it
one
at
a
time.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
one
at
a
time
is
the
prototype.
one
at
a
time
is
the
way
that
a
bookstore
sells
book,
one
at
a
time
is
the
way
we
sell
to
subscribers
and
to
use
the
colorful
language
of
the
trial
judge,
babies
are
still
born
one
at
a
time
but
the
world
is
becoming
overpopulated.
we
don't
think
that
one
at
a
time
changes
it.
we
think
it's
the
accumulation.
similarly,
we
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
the
government
is
non-profit
changes
things
at
all.
we
think
that
there
are
certain
rights
in
the
statute
which
are
limited
to
profit
such
as
the
performance
rights
that
have
been
before
the
court.
there
is
also
rights
such
as
the
ones
we're
talking
about
where
it's
not.
now
legislative
history
of
this
statute
is
important
because
all
government
use
is
non-profit
and
most
of
it
is
laudable.
any
activity
in
this
case
is
laudable,
i
say
that
quite
sincerely.
but
when
congress
want
to
pass
the
statute,
maybe
worrying
about
either
the
congressmen
that
was
asked
about
or
someone
else,
they
had
a
twofold
purpose,
one
was
to
exempt
the
individual
from
liability
and
the
second
was
to
make
the
government
liable
because
until
1960
you
could
not
sue
the
government
for
copyright
infringement.
and
in
the
course
of
that,
the
house
report
shows
that
the
photocopying
acceleration
that
was
coming
in
to
play
in
'59
and
'60
was
one
of
the
reasons
they
passed
this
statute.
the
potential
effect
on
this
is
severe.
we've
noted
that
some
of
the
things
we
were
simply
talking
about
at
the
trial
are
now
realities.
consortia,
networks
of
libraries
that
are
getting
together
at
this
stage
because
they're
finding
that
costs
go
up
and
we're
caught
in
that
vicious
cycle
our
selves.
costs
go
up,
the
audience
we
have
is
relatively
static
and
photocopying
gets
cheaper.
we
can't
raise
subscription
prices
that
will
just
make
the
cycle
more
vicious.
if
we
raise
it,
more
people
will
decide
they'd
rather
photocopy.
the
consortia
intend
to
share
soviet
union
which
has
a
practice
of
buying
one
or
two
copies
of
a
journal
and
furnishing,
i
would
presume
millions
or
thousands
of
scientists
and
others
with
it
are
with
us
and
as
i
said,
it
is
not
the
intention
of
the
petitioner
to
stop
this,
it's
an
intention
and
a
request
that
it's
copyright
be
recognized.
we
think
that
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
economic
incentive
of
maser
against
stein
issued
by
this
court.
we
think
it
would
comport
with
the
constitutional
and
statutory
purpose
of
copyright
and
we
think
it
would
preserve
the
viability
of
scientific
journals.
mr.
alan
latman
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
latman
i
am
not
sure
but
i
know
where
the
record
shows
exactly
what
is
charged.
mr.
alan
latman
well
it
does
but
we
think
that
what's
happened,
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
instead
of
doing
it
that
way,
i
have
found
similarly
that
people
will
indiscriminately
gather
reprints
but
in
the
form
of
photocopies
but
even
though
we
don't
want
to
stop
this,
we
think
that
it’s
convenient.
in
a
certain
sense,
it's
a
mixed
blessing
and
i
think
that
what
really
is
happened
is
the
very
practice
that
you
described,
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
now
in
effect
but
through
photocopy.
mr.
alan
latman
that
is
--
mr.
alan
latman
that
is
hard
a
question
which
we
think
is
quite
different
from
this
case
and
therefore
i
could
just
give
my
opinion
on
that.
of
course
to
begin
with,
there's
an
interesting
phenomenon
when
your
honor
mentions
a
chapter.
the
libraries
will
not
--
these
libraries
that
we're
suing
will
not
copy
a
chapter
from
a
book.
when
they
call
it
a
book
or
when
the
librarians
classify
it
as
a
book
or
a
monograph,
even
the
libraries
we're
suing
won't
copy
it.
they
somehow
see
a
distinction.
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
significance
to
that
fact
because
the
world
didn't
come
to
an
end
when
they
didn't
do
that.
but
let's
get
back
to
the
example.
it
would
be
harder,
my
opinion
is
that
it
would
--
first
my
opinion
is
nobody
would
sue
and
i
think
that
that's
quite
significant
here
because
it's
impractical
for
anyone
to
sue
for
a
number
of
reasons.
mr.
alan
latman
no.
nobody
would
sue
the
chief
justice
or
an
individual,
no
one
would
sue
an
individual.
it's
an
impractical
medium
of
--
mr.
alan
latman
exactly.
mr.
alan
latman
exactly.
it
would
be
precisely
that
and
therefore
it
is
to
be
contrasted
with
the
libraries
here
which
generate,
coordinate
and
stole
the
machinery
decide
incidentally
whether
to
photocopy
or
send
you
the
original.
they
make
the
decision.
they
perform
the
operation,
they
have
the
microfilm
camera,
they
print
it
themselves
and
they
give
it
to
you
and
the
result
is
some
2
million
pages
a
year
of
journal
articles
being
copied
by
these
two
libraries
alone
so
that
we
can't
call
it
diminimous
in
that.
mr.
alan
latman
it
is
that
the
procedure
is
fast.
mr.
alan
latman
it
would
be
faster
than
getting
a
reprint
and
that's
why
we
encourage
--
mr.
alan
latman
it
might
be
and
that's
why
we
encourage
the
authorized
licensing
fee
that
justice,
they
would
have
the
microfilm
which
is
another
alternative
that
they
have
the
opportunity
to
do
it
quickly.
in
fact
we
think
we
have
a
wiser
way
for
them
to
do
it.
they
ought
to
make
it
off
the
microfilm.
they
shouldn't
make
different
microfilms
and
copies
as
they
do.
we
think
that's
wasteful.
they
should
have
the
microfilm
sitting
there
with
a
license
to
make
a
copy.
mr.
alan
latman
no.
mr.
alan
latman
no
i
do
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
but
i
am
suggesting
that
when
we're
talking
about
economics
which
is
all
we're
talking
about
here,
there's
a
concession
by
the
nih
librarian
that
all
we're
talking
about
is
budgetary
considerations.
i'm
just
trying
to
suggest
how
in
that
context
it
would
be
fair,
it
would
be
proper,
it
would
be
manageable
and
we
think
it
would
be
very
important
in
saving
the
journals
and
enforcing
the
copyright
law.
i'd
like
to
save
whatever
time
i
do
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
alan
latman
thank
you.
mr.
alan
latman
well
if
i
may,
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general's
market
potential
test
is
a
good
test.
i
think
it
means
that
an
antitrust
competitor
doesn't
have
to
be
out
of
business
or
bankrupt
before
he
can
come
in
and
show
that
there's
a
certain
potential,
that's
what
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
do
here.
that's
what
was
recognized
by
the
gentleman's
agreement
referred
to.
it
said
that
it
would
not
be
fair
to
the
author
or
publisher
to
make
possible
the
substitution
of
the
photostats
for
the
original.
photostats
is
what
they
were
dealing
in.
that's
at
page
--
appendix
97
of
the
petitioner's
appendix.
computer
uses,
which
the
solicitor
general
referred
to
of
course
will
follow
a
sequel
perhaps,
in
other
words
we
can't
recover
for
any
use
if
this
court
takes
the
approach
the
court
of
claims
did.
the
reason
that
we're
suing
in
this
case
is
because
if
the
massive
system
is
excused
in
this
case,
it's
impossible
to
almost
picture
what
is
left
of
the
proprietor's
rights.
and
the
important
thing
i
think
to
remember
is
that
we're
not
just
talking
about
subscriptions,
as
some
of
the
questions,
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
emphasizes.
we're
talking
about
all
the
traditional
and
new
media.
the
government
and
its
amici
have
conceded
that
we're
talking
about
a
new
separate
medium
of
distribution
and
we
think
that
that
medium
should
be
encouraged,
we
don't
want
to
stop
it,
we
want
reasonable
compensation
for
it.
thank
you.
