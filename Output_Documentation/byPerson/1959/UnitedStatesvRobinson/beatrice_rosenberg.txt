may
it
--
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
presents
the
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
with
respect
to
the
timeliness
of
an
appeal
in
a
criminal
case.
the
pertinent
facts
are
very
simple.
rule
37
(a)
provides
that
an
appeal
in
a
criminal
case
may
be
taken
within
10
days
after
sentence
or
denial
of
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
in
this
case,
26
days
after
sentence,
the
respondent
noted
an
appeal
and
petition
for
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
the
district
court
did
grant
the
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
it
was
untimely
under
rule
37.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that
under
45
(c)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure
while
a
district
court
could
not
enlarge
at
the
time
for
appeal
within
the
10-day
period,
it
could,
after
the
expiration
of
the
10-day
period,
allow
an
untimely
appeal
on
the
showing
of
excusable
neglect.
and
it
said
that
if
the
district
court,
by
granting
permission
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis,
intended
to
find
excusable
neglect,
if
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
the
district
court
did
find
excusable
neglect
and
that
question
here
is,
whether
there
was
power
to
allow
an
untimely
appeal
after
the
10-day
period
65
rule
37.
now,
before
turning
to
the
legal
considerations
that
governs
this,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
only
question
here
is
what
the
rule
did
provide.
there
is
not
doubt
that
the
rule
makers
could
have
allowed
an
appeal
for
an
excusable
neglect
and
we
have
no
question
here
of
whether
they
should
have
done
so,
in
other
words
whether
the
policy
was
good
or
bad.
the
only
question
is
what
did
they
do?
this
is
the
first
time
in
the
13
years
or
so
the
rules
had
been
in
existence
that
any
court
has
had
--
had
held
that
they
did
make
provision
for
an
untimely
appeal.
in
fact,
that
every
other
circuit
in
the
country
has
held
to
the
contrary
and
so,
the
question
is,
as
i
have
said
simply
did
they
do
this.
it
seems
to
us
like
every
test
of
legislative
rule
making
intention
that
we
have,
language,
background,
history,
it
is
perfectly
clear
not
only
that
the
rule
makers
did
not
make
provision
for
an
untimely
appeal,
but
that
they
very
deliberately
decided
not
to.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
not
that
i
know
of.
i
think
this
is
the
only
decision
that
has
come
up
that
way.
i
don't
believe
that
it
has
been
considered
a
question
for
the
district
court.
that
is
--
i
don't
think
they've
asked
--
the
district
court
has
ever
thought
it
had
power
to
allow
an
untimely
appeal.
motions
have
usually
been
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
i
think
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
it
may
have.
i
just
don't
know
there
is
a
decision,
your
honor.
well,
let's
turn
to
these
theories,
considerations
by
which
we
judge
the
intention
of
the
rule
makers
and
the
first
is
the
language
itself.
the
rule
is
set
forth
in
page
2
of
our
brief.
rule
37,
as
i
say,
simply
says
that,
"appeal
maybe
taken
10
days
after
sentence
or
motion
for
a
new
trial."
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
rule
45
(b)
which
is
also
on
page
2
and
that
says,
"when
an
act
is
required
or
allowed
to
be
done
within
a
specified
time,
the
court
for
cause
shown
may
at
any
time
in
its
discretion
with
or
without
notice,
one,
order
the
period
enlarged
if
application
therefore
is
made
before
the
expiration
the
period
fixed
by
the
rule.
or
two,
upon
motion
permit
the
act
to
be
done
after
the
expiration
of
the
specified
period
if
the
failure
to
act
was
the
result
of
excusable
neglect,"
and
then
he
goes
on
and
these
are
the
crucial
words,
"but
the
court
may
not
enlarge
the
period
for
taking
any
action
under
rules
33,
34
and
35,
except
as
provided
in
those
rules,
or
the
period
for
taking
an
appeal."
now,
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below
is
this.
they
say,
"enlarge"
is
used
only
in
subdivision
(1).
it
is
not
the
word
used
in
subdivision
(2)
and
therefore,
the
provision
the
court
may
not
enlarge
the
period
for
taking
any
action
under
the
rules
or
the
period
for
taking
an
appeal
prohibits
enlargement
of
a
10-day
period,
but
doesn't
prohibit
action
under
(2)
allowing
an
appeal
after
the
10-day
period.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
is
the
point
of
view
of
the
court
below.
there
are
number
of
reasons
why
we
don't
think
this
interpretation
is
the
intent
of
the
drafters
of
the
rule.
in
the
first
place,
the
entire
rule
is
headed
enlargement
and
the
word
"enlargement"
in
the
title
presumably
covers
both
(1)
and
(2).
in
the
second
place,
this
last
sentence
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relies
becomes
--
makes
really
knows
that
when
you
interpreted
as
did
the
court
below
in
relation
to
rules
33,
34,
and
35.
it
says,
"enlarge
the
period
for
taking
any
action
under
rule
33,
34,
and
35
or
the
period
for
taking
an
appeal."
so
then,
"enlarge”
must
mean
the
same
thing
in
relation
to
rule
33
as
it
does
in
relation
to
taking
an
appeal.
now,
rule
33
and
rule
34
have,
they're
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
rule
33
and
rule
34
have
their
own
period
of
time
for
taking
action
within
the
period
fixed
by
the
rules.
so,
that
"enlarge"
has
used
in
relation
to
rule
33
and
34,
can't
possibly
mean
taking
action
within
the
period
fixed
by
the
rules.
the
provision
saying,
"you
can't
enlarge
the
period
for
taking
action
under
rule
33,
must
therefore
refer
to
taking
action
after
the
period
fixed
by
the
rules."
and
as
the
matter
of
fact,
this
court
in
united
sates
against
smith,
331
u.s.
said,
"that
you
can't
take
action
after
the
period
fixed
by
the
rules."
so
much
for
the
language
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
no.
in
united
states
against
smith,
your
honor,
a
motion
for
new
trial,
the
court
on
its
own
motion
tried
to
grant
a
new
trial
after
the
10-day
period
fixed
by
the
rules
and
it
was
held
that
court
on
its
own
motion
could
not
do
so,
even
in
the
interest
of
justice
--
that
the
10-day
fixed
by
the
--
10-day
period
fixed
by
the
rules,
terminated
the
power
to
grant
a
new
trial.
it
seems
to
me
the
length
--
i
should
point
out
in
this
connection
that
these
rules
went
through
10
drafts
in
the
four
years
before
they
were
promulgated
and
that
two
of
those
drafts
were
circulated,
to
the
bench,
and
the
bar
and
their
comment
asked
for.
ambiguity
have
resulted
sometimes,
but
an
ambiguity
that
would
make
this
whole
reference
to
rule
34,
35,
and
--
33,
34,
and
35
meaningless,
it
is
so
incongruous
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it
could
have
survive
10
drafts
if
that
was
the
intent
of
the
drafter,
but
we've
got
more
than
that
in
a
way
to
regard
to
legislative
intent
or
the
drafter's
intent.
these
rules
came
with
a
background
of
12
years
experience
under
the
criminal
appeals
rules
which
were
promulgated
in
1934.
now,
under
those
criminal
appeals
rules
in
1934,
the
background
was
a
very
rigid
one
in
relation
to
the
time
for
appeal.
the
time
for
appeal
was
five
days
and
there
was
in
those
rules,
no
provision
for
enlargement
of
time
such
as
rule
45
of
the
present
rules.
there
were
numerous
decisions
holding
that
there
could
be
no
untimely
appeal
after
the
five-day
period.
the
rules
--
the
1934
rules
also
had
a
provision
at
the
time
for
petitioning
for
certiorari
was
30
days
and
this
court
decided
that
it,
although
it
had
authority
to
promulgate
the
rules
that
it
was
bound
by
the
30-day
period
and
no
justice
with
the
court
granted
an
extension
of
time
in
that
period.
now,
against
that
background,
any
provision
for
an
untimely
appeal
for
excusable
neglect
would
have
been
a
marked
departure
from
the
practice
as
it
was
known
before
the
rules
were
promulgated.
and
one
would
have
expected
some
comment
on
that
in
the
two
drafts
that
were
issued
with
notes.
now,
the
revisers
have
commented
on
the
fact
that
they
were
then
extending
the
time
for
appeal
from
five
days
to
10.
they
commented
on
the
fact
that
they
were
granting
to
a
justice
of
this
court,
the
power
to
extend
the
time
for
filing
the
petition
for
certiorari,
30
days,
if
application
was
made
in
the
30-day
period.
but
there
isn't
one
word
in
the
notes
for
the
first
preliminary
draft
or
the
second
preliminary
draft
or
in
all
the
various
articles
that
the
commentators
that
drafted
the
rules
have
written,
explaining
the
rules
which
suggests
that
they
were
granting
to
the
court
the
power
to
allow
an
untimely
appeal,
except
for
this
one
comment
which
even
further
clarified
their
intent
not
to
allow
an
untimely
appeal.
and
that
is,
that
in
the
first
preliminary
draft
of
the
rules,
there
was
a
very
limited
provision
for
extension
of
time,
that's
on
page
22
of
our
brief,
and
this
provided
that
when
a
court
imposes
sentence
upon
the
represented
by
counsel,
appointed
by
the
court
or
not
represented
by
counsel,
the
court
shall
ask
for
defendant
whether
he
wishes
to
appeal.
if
the
defendant
answers
in
the
affirmative,
the
court
shall
direct
the
clerk
forth
with
to
prepare,
file
and
serve
on
behalf
of
the
defendant
a
notice
of
appeal
and
then,
this
is
the
crucial
thing
or
shall
extend
the
time
specified
by
the
rule
for
filling
the
notice
of
appeal.
in
accordance
with
that,
at
the
top
of
page
23
of
our
brief,
rule
45
which
proposed
rule
45
(b),
equivalent
of
it,
as
it
was
proposed
in
the
first
draft
said,
"but,
the
court
may
not
enlarge
the
period
for
taking
an
appeal
except
as
provided
in
rule
35
(a)
(2),
which
was
the
number
of
the
appeal
rule
in
that
first
draft.
now,
that
very
limited
provision
for
an
extension
of
time
was
dropped
by
the
second
draft
of
the
rules
and
never
reappeared.
the
only
thing
that
remained
is
the
provision
that
where
a
defendant
is
not
represented
by
counsel,
the
clerk
will
note
his
appeal
for
him,
so
that
this
obviously
represented
a
deliberate
decision
although
the
reason
for
it
was
not
commented
on
the
notes
of
the
second
draft,
but
it
was
there,
the
first
set
was
circulated
and
then
it
was
dropped.
so
that,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
revisers
knew
how
to
draft
the
provision
for
an
extension
of
--
or
allowing
untimely
appeal
if
they
want
to
do
it
or
allowing
an
extension,
and
they
decided
not
to.
and
we
have
still
one
(inaudible)
guide
to
the
intentions
of
the
drafter
and
that
is,
rule
6
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
as
they
then
read
at
the
time
of
the
promulgation
of
the
criminal
rules,
that's
on
page
25
of
our
brief,
they
provided
much
as
rule
45
be
does
now,
the
court
may
not
enlarge
the
period
for
taking
any
action
under
specific
rules
or
the
period
for
taking
an
appeal
as
provided
by
law.
and
under
the
civil
rules
which
were
the
model
of
45
(b),
the
cases
up
to
that
time
had
held
that
the
time
for
appeal
was
jurisdictional
and
that
you
could
not
allow
an
appeal
untimely
even
though
there
was
excusable
neglect.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
haven't
found
any,
your
honor.
i
the
--
i
have
not
found
any
suggestion
of
this
interpretation
of
the
rules
until
the
opinion
by
the
court
below.
the
only
other
point
that
might
be
said
to
agree
with
the
opinion
of
the
--
i
--
i
think
the
idea
must
have
come
from
this
fact
which
i
was
going
to
talk
about,
which
is
that
in
1948,
when
the
civil
rules
were
amended
in
the
refining
process
that
does
come
about
when
rules
are
being
reconsidered,
the
word
"enlarge"
in
rule
(6)
of
the
federal
rule
was
changed
to
extend.
and
the
notes
to
the
advisory
committees
on
those
rules
say,
at
page
26
of
our
brief,
the
phrase
“extend
the
time”
is
substituted
for
“enlarged
period”
because
the
former
is
a
more
suitable
expression
and
relates
more
clearly
to
those
clauses
(1)
and
(2).
but
i
want
to
point
out
which
i
think
we
didn't
mention
in
the
brief
that
this
refinement
didn't
even
the
current
of
address.
this
is
the
civil
rule
until
the
second
preliminary
draft.
the
first
preliminary
draft
which
contains
three
alternatives
about
--
how
to
handle
this
problem
or
continue
to
use
the
term
"enlarge"
in
a
way
which
i
think
leaves
no
room
for
doubt
that
there
were
referring
to
both
(1)
and
(2)
that
is
enlargement
during
the
period
or
extending
the
time
after
the
termination
of
the
period.
and
it
wasn't
until
the
second
preliminary
draft
of
the
civil
rules
that
it
occurred
to
someone
that
the
word
“extension”
was
possibly
a
more
ashtrays
than
"enlarge."
and
so,
from
the
time
the
civil
rules
were
promulgated
until
the
1944
amendment
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find,
it
was
just
assumed
that
"enlarge"
in
that
context
of,
enlarge
the
time
for
taking
an
appeal,
prohibited
an
untimely
appeal
under
subdivision
(2)
as
well
as
an
extension
of
time
to
the
take
the
appeal
under
subdivision
(1)
and
as
i
say
particularly,
it
was
thinking
about
intent
of
the
drafters.
but
absence
of
comments,
the
fact,
while
they're
coming
in
on
all
sorts
of
minor
changes
like
extending
the
time
for
five
to
10
days,
but
the
absence
of
any
suggestion
that
they
were
departing
from
what
have
been
the
12
year
--
year
experience
of
a
rigid
time
for
appeal,
suggested
it
never
occurred
to
them
that
they
were
extending
the
time
for
appeal
in
the
sense
of
allowing
an
appeal
for
excusable
neglect.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
is
headed
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
this
is
the
one
rule
of
governing
enlargement
generally.
of
course,
there
are
in
the
rules
like
rule
33
itself
has
a
provision
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh,
no,
your
honor.
this
is
the
one
rule
that
covers
it
generally.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
this
is
the
one
rule
on
enlargement
or
extension
as
except
as
to
specific
provision
is
made
to
do
a
particular
thing.
this
is
the
one
general
rule
covering
--
this
whole
rule
governs
time,
that
is
the
first
part
of
the
rule
governs
the
time
within
how
you
calculate
time
and
then
second
part
covers
enlargement
of
time,
so
that
there
is
no
guide
there.
now,
this
court
last
year
in
the
isthmian
case
pointed
out
that
if
rules
are
to
be
changed,
there
is
a
method
of
changing
them.
as
i
understand
it,
the
criminal
rules
are
now
in
the
process
of
being
studied
with
a
view
towards
revision.
the
policy
consideration
for
or
against
allowing
an
untimely
appeal
for
excusable
fact
can
be
made
at
that
point.
there
are
obviously,
i
think
policy
considerations
for
and
against.
it
seems
to
us,
we
can
never
escape
from
the
conclusion
that
the
draft
is
of
--
the
present
rule
deliberately
shows
the
policy
of
a
rigid
time
for
appeal,
10
days
instead
of
five
before
but
nevertheless
a
rigid
time
for
appeal.
that
policy
should
be
reconsidered,
the
place
to
reconsider
it
is
in
the
revision
of
the
rules,
but
the
language
and
the
background
and
the
history
of
the
rule
we
think
make
it
clear
that
when
these
rules
were
drafted,
that
was
not
the
policy
chosen.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
there
was
no
power
to
grant
an
extension
of
time
to
appeal,
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
because
there
was
no
power.
that
is
--
even
the
court
below
could
insist
that
within
--
concedes
that
the
effect
of
rule
45
(b)
is
that
within
the
10-day
period,
a
district
court
may
do
nothing.
it
may
not
enlarge
the
time
for
taking
an
appeal
and
that
as
i
say,
the
court
below
concedes
also
that
otherwise
for
the
language
of
rule
45
(b)
with
respect
to
appeal
would
be
absolutely
meaningless,
but
in
that
it
held
that
even
though
you
can't
do
it
within
the
10-day
period,
you
can
do
it
sometime
after
without
(inaudible)
presumably
five
years
later
if
excusable
--
excusable
neglect
was
shown.
