mr.
howard
a.
heffron
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit.
it
involves
another
facet
of
the
same
general
issue
which
was
before
the
court
in
the
last
argued
case,
aquilino
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
statutory
scheme
in
north
carolina
whose
laws
are
involved
in
this
case
is
somewhat
different
from
the
scheme
of
the
new
york
statutes,
but
its
purpose
is
the
same.
and
i
will
attempt
to
relate
the
north
carolina
statutes
and
their
effect
as
i
discuss
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
taxpayer
here,
as
in
aquilino,
is
a
general
contractor
who
completed
work
on
a
construction
contract
with
the
owner.
the
contract
was
completed
and
the
proceeds
are
now
due
under
the
contract.
the
federal
tax
lien
preceded
here
the
assertion
by
the
subcontractors
of
their
rights
under
north
carolina
law.
under
the
north
carolina
statutory
scheme,
the
subcontractors,
they
give
notice
to
the
owner
of
any
liability
which
they
claim
owes
to
them
from
the
general
contractor.
as
of
that
time,
they
have
a
right
to
sue
the
owner
for
the
balance
of
any
funds
in
the
owner's
possession
which
are
owed
to
the
general
contractor.
in
this
case,
the
subcontractors
gave
their
notice
to
the
owner
subsequent
to
the
time
the
federal
tax
lien
arose
and
the
subcontractor's
claimed
that
as
a
result
of
their
action,
the
affect
of
north
carolina
law
was
to
give
them
an
independent
statutory
right
against
the
owner
for
the
proceeds
of
the
construction
contract
which
were
had
yet
been
unpaid.
the
fourth
circuit
agreed
with
the
subcontractors
and
held
that
their
right
was
to
be
preferred
to
that
of
the
federal
government
under
the
tax
lien.
now,
under
the
provisions
of
north
carolina
law,
the
rights
of
the
subcontractors
do
not
arise
until
they
do
something
--
until
something
affirmative
is
done.
in
this
instance,
that
was
the
act
of
furnishing
the
owner
with
the
notice
required
under
north
carolina
law.
it
is
from
that
time
that
their
rights
date
so
that
unlike
the
new
york
statute
where
the
subcontractor's
rights
to
the
trust
fund
arose
just
as
soon
as
their
debt
was
unpaid
by
the
contractor.
under
north
carolina
law,
that
is
not
the
case.
the
arising
of
the
contractor's
liability
to
the
subcontractor
is
not
the
date
from
which
the
subcontractor's
rights
spring.
the
effect
of
date
under
north
carolina
law
is
the
date
they
supplied
the
affirmative
act
required
of
them
by
statute,
which
is
to
serve
the
notice
upon
the
owner.
now,
when
that
notice
is
served
upon
the
owner
under
north
carolina
law,
the
owner
is
directed
by
statute
to
hold
the
proceeds
aside.
he
may
not
pay
the
proceeds
to
the
contractor
on
the
construction
contract.
if
he
does
so,
he
will
nevertheless
have
to
settle
with
the
subcontractors
so
that
he
faces
the
threat
of
double
liability
in
that
instance.
the
north
carolina
cases
have
said
that
the
owner
holds
the
proceeds
in
--
in
what
is
in
essence
a
trust
fund
and
that
the
subcontractors
derive
a
right
after
they
furnish
the
required
notice
to
have
an
accounting
in
an
ordinary
civil
action,
the
accounting
for
the
trust
fund,
so
that
in
that
respect
the
north
carolina
scheme
is
similar
to
that
which
was
before
the
court
in
new
york.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
they
do.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
the
north
carolina
cases
do,
the
statute
does
not,
but
the
north
carolina
cases
have
construed
the
effect
of
the
giving
of
notice
by
the
subcontractor
as
creating
a
trust
fund
in
the
hands
of
the
owner
of
any
funds
he
has
which
is
not
yet
dispersed
to
the
general
contractor.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
i
believe
the
fourth
circuit
relied
on
the
service
of
the
notice
by
the
mechanic
as
the
act
which
gave
right
for
their
independent
right
to
payment
from
the
owner
under
north
carolina
law.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
there
is
such
a
requirement.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
take
it
that
under
north
carolina
law,
the
same
interest
would
arise
on
the
subcontractors
if
the
contractor
himself
had
furnished
this
notice
to
the
owner.
some
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
did
not
in
this
instance.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
record
shows
that
the
only
notice
which
was
furnished
here,
was
that
furnished
by
the
subcontractor
and
that
was
--
and
that
came
after
the
federal
tax
lien
had
arisen.
now
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
--
i
would
say
it
is
not
regarded
as
a
garden
variety
trust.
although
i
don't
believe
the
question
was
ever
put
to
the
north
carolina
courts
in
those
terms,
but
if
we
analyze
the
incidents
of
this
trust,
i
think
we
can
--
we
would
submit
that
it
is
not
the
garden
variety
trust.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
you
mean
in
the
garden
variety
situation
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
i
believe
there
have
been
cases
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
believe
that
that
if
the
transfer
of
the
property
interest
indisputably
occurred
prior
to
the
federal
tax
lien
that
the
government
has
not
asserted
that
it
would
come
prior
to
such
a
transfer.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
this
provision
dates
over
100
years,
i
believe.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
would
say
first,
that
we
--
we
would
submit
that
the
statutes
which
we
are
involved
here
in
north
carolina
and
new
york
and
the
other
case
are
not
the
garden
variety
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
conventional
type
trusts.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
don't
think
that
any
position
has
been
developed.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
wouldn't
say
they
are
devices
for
evasion
so
much
as
that
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
they
are
--
they
are
designed
to
prefer
the
mechanics
to
those
of
any
other
claims
which
are
asserted
against
the
general
contractor.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
might
if
the
circumstances
were
such
as
to
justify
that
inference.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
it
cannot.
i
would
--
i
think
we
would
say
that
where
the
said
law
of
the
trust
had
an
existing
property
interest
which
was
indisputably
his
and
the
tax
lien
arose
prior
to
that
time
that
even
by
operation
of
law,
a
trust
could
not
be
created
to
benefit
a
creditor
by
the
taxpayer.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
there
is.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
under
the
north
carolina
statute,
the
subcontractor
must
perform
an
affirmative
act.
he
must
supply
a
notice
to
the
owner
which
states
how
much
is
due
and
owing
to
him.
and
from
that
time,
the
trust
stated
under
new
york
law
no
affirmative
act
is
required
of
the
subcontractor
to
the
extent
that
at
anytime,
he
has
owed
sums
for
his
work.
at
that
time,
the
trust
would
arise
with
respect
to
any
funds
in
the
hands
of
the
owner
which
are
still
due
on
the
contract
to
the
contractor.
now,
if
we
examine
this
trust,
the
so-called
trust
under
either
new
york
law
or
north
carolina
law,
i
think
it
fails
of
one
of
the
prime
incidence
of
a
conventional
trust.
it
is
not
the
present
transfer
of
a
property
right.
the
so-called
beneficiary
here
still
has
yet
to
prove
his
--
that
the
contractor
is
liable
to
him.
he
still
must
meet
the
ordinary
requirements
of
showing
that
he
shows
an
action
against
the
contractor
has
validity.
he
must
plead
and
prove
that
he's
performed
his
contract
with
the
contractor
and
that
this
sum
is
due
and
owing
to
him.
in
that
respect,
we
would
submit
that
the
--
the
transfer
of
the
property
interest
which
--
which
is
implicit
in
the
notion
of
trust
has
not
yet
occurred
in
the
conventional
sense.
here,
the
beneficiary
still
has
various
conditions
which
he
must
meet.
he
must
show
compliance
with
his
contract
with
the
contractor
here.
he
must
prove
his
cause
of
action.
we
would
submit
on
the
other
hand
that
the
situation
of
the
owner
here
after
the
notice
has
been
given
to
him
and
after
the
so-called
trust
arises
is
really
no
different
from
what
his
situation
would
be
if
an
attachment
had
been
served
on
him.
for
example,
under
new
york
law
and
i
believe
under
the
law
of
most
jurisdictions,
when
an
attachment
is
served
on
a
party,
that
party
is
under
direct
order
of
the
court
not
to
dispose
of
the
funds
allegedly
owing
to
the
taxpayer.
if
he
does
dispose
of
them
in
anyway
inconsistent
with
the
attachment,
he
is
not
relieved
of
liability.
he
may
still
incur
a
liability.
he
is
formally
directed
by
the
writ
of
attachment
to
hold
the
funds.
the
funds
await
the
disposition
of
the
action
brought
against
the
taxpayer.
so
here,
we
would
submit
that
the
effect
of
the
notice
which
was
served
upon
the
owner
was
also
to
put
the
owner
under
order
of
state
statute,
not
to
dispose
of
the
funds
and
if
he
did
so,
to
dispose
of
them
under
pain
of
future
liability
to
the
subcontractors.
but
while
he
was
under
this
order
not
to
dispose
or
deal
with
the
funds
in
anyway,
nevertheless,
the
subcontractor's
rights
were
just
as
contingent
as
the
rights
of
an
attaching
creditor
or
a
garnishing
creditor
or
a
landlord
under
a
distraint
warrant.
his
rights
were
still
subject
to
being
tested
by
the
outcome
of
the
lawsuit.
he
still
had
to
prove
the
validity
of
his
cause
of
action.
and
we
would
submit
that
therefore,
the
subcontractors
in
this
case,
even
though
their
rights
be
termed
trust
for
some
purposes
under
state
law,
have
no
greater
rights
vis-à-vis
the
custodian
of
the
funds
here,
the
owner
than
the
attaching
creditor
had
in
the
acri
case
in
the
garnishing
creditor
had
in
the
liverpool
and
london
case
and
on
the
landlord
had
under
distress
lien.
in
the
scovil
case,
in
all
of
those
cases,
this
court
held
that
although
it
is
conceded
the
effect
of
the
attachment
or
the
paper
which
had
been
served
on
the
third
party
was
to
place
that
party
under
order
of
state
law
to
refrain
from
disposing
of
the
funds
and
to
hold
those
funds
pending
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
against
the
taxpayer,
this
court
held
in
all
of
those
cases
where
the
rights
of
the
contending
party
had
attached
under
state
law
prior
to
the
tax
lien
that
the
government
would
prevail.
now,
here,
of
course,
under
our
facts,
the
rights
of
the
government
precede
those
of
the
subcontractors
because
the
paper
which
set
the
force
of
state
statute
in
motion
had
not
been
served
until
subsequent
to
the
attaching
of
the
federal
tax
lien.
similarly
in
the
mechanics'
lien
cases,
the
effect
of
serving
the
mechanics'
lien
and
filing
it
and
recording
it,
which
was
done
in
the
white
bear
case,
for
example,
under
state
law,
was
to
make
the
owner
of
the
property
require
to
hold
it
pending
the
outcome
of
litigation.
it
was
under
direct
order
of
state
statute
to
do
that.
if
he
disposed
of
it,
he
could
--
he
could
not
discharge
his
liability.
he
had
to
hold
the
property.
we
submit
that
in
essence
as
the
effect
of
the
trust
in
this
--
under
new
york
law
and
under
north
carolina
law.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes,
under
--
under
our
federal
statute.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
for
example
under
new
york
law.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
of
course
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
but
there
--
there's
no
such
instantaneous
result
under
north
carolina
law.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
our
answer
would
have
to
be
the
same.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
this
court
has
construed
the
federal
tax
lien
as
reaching
after
acquired
property
of
the
taxpayer.
we
would
submit
that
in
this
case
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
if
that
after
acquired
holding
is
to
be
given
effect,
it
must
apply
to
the
shows-in-action
which
the
contractor
has
obtained
by
performing
his
contract
with
the
owner,
and
that
the
result
should
not
be
different
when
we're
dealing
with
property
which
is
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
tax
lien.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
if
--
if
it
in
use
solely
to
the
benefit
of
someone
else,
i
think
it
would
be
a
harder
case.
in
this
case,
as
we
conceive
it,
it
inures
to
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayer
because
when
the
net
result
of
all
the
transactions
is
totaled
up,
we
find
that
the
contract
a
taxpayer
has
discharged
his
indebtedness.
he
is
no
longer
liable
to
the
subcontractors.
he
doesn't
--
whereas
before
the
trust
arose,
he
owed
money
to
subcontractors
after
the
trust
has
arisen
and
the
requirements
of
state
law
are
carried
out,
the
taxpayer
no
longer
owes
any
money
to
the
subcontractors.
his
obligations
are
discharged.
his
balance
sheet
looks
different.
he
suffered
--
he
has
obtained,
rather,
an
economic
gain.
these
claims
which
were
admittedly
in
existence
against
him
prior
to
the
serving
of
notice
under
state
law
have
been
wiped
out.
now,
we
submit
that
when
those
claims
were
wiped
out,
they
were
wiped
out
with
something
which
the
contractor
had,
and
that's
borne
out
by
the
result
under
state
statute
that
if
the
owner
pays
the
subcontractors
after
the
trust
has
arisen,
he
is
discharged
of
all
indebtedness
to
the
owner.
so
that
when
the
transactions
are
worked
out,
we
find
that
the
owner
who
had
to
show
his
action
against
the
--
i'd
rather,
i
beg
your
pardon
--
the
contractor
who
had
shows-in-action
against
the
owner
prior
to
the
serving
of
notice
no
longer
has
such
shows-in-action
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
--
the
contractor
taxpayer
who
had
a
debt
owing
to
the
subcontractors,
when
the
transaction
is
completed,
no
longer
he's
under
such
a
liability.
the
result
has
been,
we
submit,
no
matter
how
the
state
labels
the
transaction,
that
the
contractor
shows
an
action
has
been
used
to
pay
the
subcontractor's
claim
against
the
contractor.
now,
it
--
it's
true
that
one
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
the
lien
is
attached
to
the
intangible
of
the
shows-in-action.
this
court
has
held
that
the
federal
tax
lien
reaches
intangibles
as
well
as
tangibles.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
now,
at
a
point
in
time
here
before
the
owner
segregated
the
fund,
there
was
simply
a
shows-in-action
which
the
contractor
held
against
the
owner.
now,
up
until
that
time
under
north
carolina
law,
prior
to
the
time
the
notice
was
given
by
the
subcontractors,
the
owner
could
have
paid
the
contractor
and
the
subcontractors
would
have
no
rights.
for
example,
he's
been
held
in
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
our
answer
to
that
would
have
to
be
that
this
is
not
that
type
of
conventional
trust,
that
it
does
not
effectuate
a
present
transfer
of
a
property
interest.
these
beneficiaries
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes
and
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
effect
of
--
as
--
as
to
the
underlying
rights
and
liabilities
created
by
state
law.
the
subcontractors
must
prove
their
case
regardless
of
the
fact
that
they
alleged
they
are
beneficiaries
of
the
so-called
trust,
and
their
rights
are
subject
to
being
attacked
first
by
the
contractor
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
by
the
owner
and
by
any
other
subcontractors
because
this
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
he
states
the
underlying
premises
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
in
detail
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
i
--
and
we
submit
that
judge
fuld
held
that
those
incidents
under
new
york
law
such
that
he
could
only
characterize
the
effect
of
the
trust
as
a
security
device
to
prefer
one
class
of
creditors
to
those
of
another.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
think
he
had
to
reach
that
point
ultimately
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
because
that
was
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case.
but
certainly,
in
the
first
instance,
he
had
to
decide
what
the
effects
of
new
york
law
were,
and
he
had
before
him
the
prior
decision
of
the
second
circuit
which
was
referred
to
on
thursday
which
first
articulated
in
detail
the
property
and
rights
to
property
analysis.
so
that
he
knew
precisely
submit
what
he
was
doing
in
that
case.
he
had
that
analysis
before
him
and
he
chose
to
characterize
the
effect
of
new
york
statute
as
a
method
of
preferring
one
creditor
to
another
which
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
is
frankly
what
the
north
carolina
courts
do.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
doubt
that
under
north
carolina
law,
the
north
carolina
courts
themselves
have
said,
this
is
a
method
of
preferring
the
subcontractor
to
the
general
contractor
himself.
this
is
a
method
of
preferring
one
class
of
creditors
to
those
of
other
creditors.
we
submit
that
inevitably
must
be
the
conclusion
here
because
of
the
result.
the
result
is
that
the
taxpayer
finds
himself
in
a
situation
he
no
longer
owes
money
to
the
subcontractors
but
he
does
owe
money
to
the
federal
government
on
the
tax
lien.
whereas
if
our
position
were
accepted,
the
taxpayer
would
no
longer
owe
money
to
the
federal
government
but
he
would
owe
money
to
the
subcontractors.
we
submit
the
result
inevitably
must
be
that
a
class
of
creditors
is
being
preferred
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
we
submit
that
looking
at
the
transaction
from
the
result,
if
i
may
call
it
that,
is
--
is
the
analysis
which
this
court
adopted
in
other
cases
in
this
field.
in
--
in
the
cases
where
a
state
law
characterized
the
lien
as
specific
and
choate
for
all
purposes.
this
court
did
not
start
with
that
premise
and
then
work
back
to
see
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--
what
happens
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
precisely.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
suppose
if
one
were
to
accept
the
position
that
under
state
law
the
rights
of
the
subcontractors
had
become
so
fixed
that
there
was
no
property
left
in
the
taxpayer,
why,
that
would
terminate
the
question
just
as
in
the
new
britain
case
and
in
the
acri
case
and
the
other
cases,
one
might
have
argued
that
the
rights
of
the
creditors
have
become
so
specific
and
choate
that
their
rights
divest
the
taxpayer
of
any
interest
for
the
competing
lien
of
the
government
to
attach
to.
if
the
approach
of
the
taxpayer
is
adopted
here,
then
the
position
this
court
has
taken
in
a
whole
line
of
cases
can
be
undone
by
waiving
the
wand
of
the
label
because
instead
of
taking
the
--
the
competing
creditors
have
lost
the
battle
over
arguing
that
their
lien
is
so
specific
and
choate
under
--
under
state
law
that
they
must
succeed
against
the
federal
government.
now,
they
simply
shift
their
ground
and
say,
“well,
our
lien
is
so
specific
and
choate
that
there's
no
property
in
the
taxpayer.
how
do
we
know
there's
no
property?
well,
the
taxpayer
can't
get
it
himself
and
no
other
of
these
creditors
can
get
it.
well,
this
is
precisely
the
position
which
was
taken
by
the
competing
creditors
and
all
the
other
cases.
instead
of
using
the
labeled
property,
they
used
the
label
specific
and
choate
under
state
law.
the
results
were
precisely
the
same.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
in
this
case,
that
would
not
be
necessary
because
on
our
--
on
our
admitted
facts
here,
the
subcontractor's
rights
did
not
come
into
existence
under
state
law
until
such
--
until
subsequent
to
the
federal
tax
lien.
but
we
would
submit
that
the
--
the
aquilino
case
would
not
require
a
different
result
either
because
there,
the
federal
tax
lien
arose
even
prior
to
the
contract,
prior
to
the
shows-in-action
which
the
contractor
required.
so
we
would
not
distinguish
either
of
these
cases.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
if
what
has
happened
here
is
that
a
federal
tax
lien
has
attached
to
property
of
the
taxpayer,
we
would
submit
that
the
taxpayer
cannot
thereafter
declare
himself
the
settlor
of
the
trust
for
the
benefit
of
other
creditors
and
that
state
law
can
similarly
cannot
--
cannot
reach
that
result
either.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
yes.
in
essence,
the
subcontractors
here
are
like
attaching
creditors.
their
rights
are
contingent
in
the
same
sense
that
the
rights
of
all
the
other
creditors
who
--
who
lost
in
their
priority
claims
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
would
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
would
have
to
reply
to
that,
that
the
--
the
trust
is
no
more
anticipated
--
anticipatorily
created
by
the
state
here
than
the
rights
of
the
mechanics
under
the
mechanics'
liens
in
the
white
bear
and
the
colotta
and
other
cases
which
this
court
has
decided.
in
those
cases,
the
argument
could
also
have
been
made
that
the
rights
of
the
mechanics
under
state
law
were
anticipatorily
created
prior
to
the
federal
tax
lien.
and
for
that
reason,
they
should
prevail.
this
court
has
--
has
always
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
once
the
mechanics'
lien
attaches
and
all
of
these
cases,
we've
had
a
battle
between
the
government
and
the
mechanic
over
a
fund
which
is
insufficient
to
satisfy
both
claims.
the
practical
effect
was
if
the
mechanics'
lien
prevailed,
there
was
no
property
left
for
the
government.
on
--
in
many
of
these
cases,
the
state
courts
have
characterized
the
effect
of
their
liens
as
divesting
the
taxpayer
of
property.
we'd
submit
this
is
simply
another
way
of
arguing
the
specific
and
choate
point,
a
battle
which
was
we
thought
over
in
this
court
a
long
time
ago.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
would
submit
again
that
one
must
look
to
the
rights
and
liabilities
as
created
by
the
state
statutes.
the
objective
facts,
as
your
honor
characterized
them
a
little
while
ago.
and
when
you
--
when
those
objective
facts
are
examined,
the
results
would
have
to
be
the
same
because
the
objective
facts
are
the
same
here
as
they
were
in
all
the
other
cases
which
this
court
decided.
it's
for
that
reason
that
we
submit
these
cases
governed
by
--
by
the
principles
which
this
court
has
laid
down
in
the
other
cases.
