mr.
william
wenzel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner,
arthur
f.
quern,
the
current
director
of
the
illinois
department
of
public
aid,
requests
this
court
to
review
and
overturn
the
en
banc
ruling
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
petitioner
submits
has
undermined
this
court's
ruling
in
this
very
litigation
in
edelman
v.
jordan,
which
established
the
state’s
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
under
the
eleventh
amendment
to
the
untied
states
constitution.
the
en
banc
ruling
of
the
seventh
circuit
authorizes
a
federal
court
to
mandate
the
issuance
of
a
class
notice
regarding
entitlement
to
retroactive
welfare
benefits
to
more
than
twenty
thousand
welfare
recipients,
relief,
which
petitioner
contends
is
designed
to
secure
indirectly
the
very
same
monetary
award,
which
this
court
prohibited
under
the
eleventh
amendment
in
edelman.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
in
1971,
plaintiff
filed
the
civil
rights
class
action
in
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
challenged
the
failure
of
the
illinois
welfare
officials
to
comply
with
federal
time
standards
for
processing
applications
for
assistance
under
former
title
16
of
the
social
security
act,
the
aged,
blind
and
disabled
program.
federal
regulations
have
been
issued
by
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
in
1968,
which
established
specific
time
standards
for
processing
applications.
from
1968,
until
plaintiff
filed
his
lawsuit,
the
defendant
welfare
officials
had
processed
applications
pursuant
to
state
regulations,
which
were
inconsistent
with
the
federal
time
standards.
accordingly,
the
district
court
on
april
16,
1971,
preliminarily
enjoined
the
welfare
officials
from
enforcing
their
own
state
standards
and
compelled
them
to
follow
the
federal
time
standards
issued
by
hew.
in
march
of
1972,
the
preliminary
injunction
was
made
permanent.
in
addition,
the
district
court
awarded
equitable
restitution
for
retroactive
welfare
benefits
wrongfully
withheld
for
all
those
applicants
for
aabd
who
had
applied
between
the
date
of
the
issuance
of
the
federal
regulations
in
1968
and
april
16,
1971,
the
date
that
the
state
regulations
had
been
declared
invalid.
this
award
of
equitable
restitution
was
ultimately
reversed
by
this
court
in
edelman
v.
jordan
as
violating
the
state
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
this
court
reasoned
that
an
award
of
equitable
restitution
is
in
all
practical
sense,
relief
against
the
state
as
the
real
party
in
interest.
this
court
further
reasoned
that
under
the
doctrine
of
ex
parte
young,
a
federal
court's
remedial
powers
consistent
with
the
eleventh
amendment
are
limited
to
perspective
injunctive
relief
and
may
not
include
a
retroactive
award
or
relief
which
compensates
for
pre-litigation
conduct
or
past
misconduct,
which
is
completed.
this
court
accordingly
reversed
and
remanded
the
seventh
circuit
decision
to
the
contrary
with
instructions
to
have
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
eleventh
amendment
ruling.
however,
on
remand
in
the
district
court,
plaintiff
filed
a
motion
to
require
the
state
defendant
to
issue
a
notice
to
each
of
the
twenty
thousand
individuals
or
more
whose
applications
for
assistance
had
been
delayed
during
the
period
of
1968
through
1971
and
informed
them
of
their
possible
entitlement
to
the
very
same
retroactive
welfare
benefits,
which
this
court
had
denied
and
to
inform
them
of
their
right
to
appeal
through
administrative
proceedings,
the
denials
of
those
welfare
benefits.
this
was
over,
of
course,
the
state's
objection
that
it
violated
the
law
of
this
case
as
handed
down
in
edelman
and
that
it
violated
sovereign
immunity
as
embodied
in
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
district
court
disagreed.
the
district
viewed
notice
relief
as
a
relief
which
did
not
compensate
per
se,
and
that
edelman
was
limited
to
relief
which
compensated
per
se,
and
that
this
relief
while
related
to
the
possibility
of
securing
a
retroactive
monetary
award
was
something
different
than
an
actual
award
itself.
on
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit,
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
seventh
circuit
disagreed.
it
found
that
the
actual
notice
that
the
district
court
had
allowed
contained
a
predetermination
of
state
liability
and
that
this
sort
of
notice
relief
therefore
violated
the
law
of
the
case
and
violated
the
eleventh
amendment.
plaintiff
sought
a
rehearing
en
banc,
which
was
granted.
the
seventh
circuit
sitting
en
banc,
four
judges
to
three,
decided
that
the
district
court
had
in
fact
erred
in
the
specific
notice
relief
that
it
had
envisioned,
because
it
did
contain
a
predetermination
of
the
state's
liability.
however,
the
seventh
circuit
sitting
en
banc
did
feel
that
a
federal
court
could
authorize
notice
relief,
which
was
related
to
retroactive
welfare
benefits,
as
long
as
it
did
not
contain
a
predetermination
of
liability.
the
seventh
circuit
in
authorizing
this
some
form
of
notice
relief
conceded
they
would
operate
against
the
state
sovereign
and
not
merely
against
the
director
of
the
department
of
public
aid.
so,
the
issue
now
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
retrospective
equitable
relief
against
a
non-consenting
sovereign
in
the
form
of
a
notice
related
to
retroactive
welfare
benefits
is
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
edelman
or
is
consistent
with
the
state's
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
william
wenzel
your
honor,
there
is
a
case
of
controversy.
we
do
have
a
significant
controversy,
because
we
feel
that
any
form
of
notice
relief
under
this
case
which
will
ultimately
secure
members
of
the
plaintiff
class,
the
retroactive
benefits
which
were
denied
by
this
court
will
either
violate
this
court's
ruling
in
edelman
or
violate
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
william
wenzel
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
during
this
very
period
in
time
you
mentioned,
1968
to
1971
and
up
through
1974
as
a
matter
of
fact,
illinois
did
participate
in
a
federal
state
scheme
of
cooperative
federalism
known
as
the
aid
to
aged,
blind
and
disabled
program.
at
that
time,
as
a
mater
of
state
law,
illinois
would
have
permitted
people
who
had
been
denied
assistance
to
appeal
and
if
they
prevailed
under
administrative
appeal
or
if
they
eventually
prevailed
in
a
judicial
review,
would
have
permitted
the
payment
of
retroactive
relief.
this
case,
however,
is
not
that
simple
because
of
the
action
of
the
united
states
congress
in
1974
in
repealing
former
title
16
of
the
social
security
act
and
replacing
it
with
a
wholly
federally
funded
and
authorized
supplemental
security
income
program.
therefore,
at
present
and
since
1974,
illinois
has
not
been
participating
in
a
federal
program.
so
the
question
becomes,
if
a
particular
recipient
were
to
seek
administrative
review
today,
and
if
he
were
to
go
into
state
court
and
this
court
were
to
consider
the
question
whether
he
was
entitled
to
retroactive
relief,
i
think
it
would
first
have
to
deal
with
the
threshold
question
of
whether
the
state
was
still
participating
in
the
federal
program
and
it
is
not
today.
mr.
william
wenzel
your
honor,
we
view
notice
relief
as
very
closely
related
to
an
actual
award
of
benefits
themselves,
but
our
position
goes
further
than
that.
we
do
not
view
the
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
nor
this
court's
decision
in
edelman
as
to
limit
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
to
only
those
cases
involving
an
actual
award
of
monetary
relief.
we
believe
that
the
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
must
include
those
cases,
which
require
the
sovereign
to
act
affirmatively
or
which
triggers
the
operation
of
governmental
machinery.
we
draw
support
for
that
proposition
from
this
court's
rulings
under
the
issue
of
federal
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
in
the
larson
versus
domestic
&
foreign
commerce
corporation
and
--
mr.
william
wenzel
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
wenzel
yes
and
i
really
did
not
complete
my
exposition
of
the
state
procedures.
if
i
could
back
up
to
answer
both
justice
stevens'
and
justice
rehnquist's
questions,
notice
relief
will
trigger
governmental
machinery
and
will
intrude
upon
the
sovereign
state
of
illinois
in
the
following
respects.
the
notice
will
go
out.
twenty
thousand
or
more
welfare
recipients
will
file
request
for
appeals
with
the
administrative
agency.
the
agency
will
hold
hearings
themselves
and
depending
upon
the
conclusion
or
the
final
decisions
in
those
agency
hearings,
the
recipients
will
have
a
right
to
seek
judicial
review
in
the
state
courts.
if
the
state
court
should
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
retroactive
assistance
should
be
paid
to
members
of
the
plaintiff
class,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
petitioner,
the
director
of
the
department
does
not
have
the
power
to
request
the
state
comptroller
to
draw
or
the
state
treasurer
to
pay
an
assistance
warrant,
which
relates
to
an
appropriation
which
has
lapsed.
we
are
talking
here
with
obligations
that
relate
to
appropriations
for
the
years
1968
through
1971.
under
illinois
law
those
appropriation
members
have
lapsed.
the
director
does
not
have
the
power
nor
does
the
--
mr.
william
wenzel
that
is
correct,
the
next
step
--
mr.
william
wenzel
that
is
correct.
so,
we
are
at
the
point
at
the
court
of
claims
perhaps
even
ruling
in
the
favor
of
the
members
of
the
plaintiff's
class
here,
which
under
illinois
law
is
a
mere
recommendation
to
the
general
assembly
to
pay
or
not
to
pay,
but
the
catch
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
the
federal
court
that
has
issued
the
notice
relief
stands
ready
to
intervene
at
any
particular
point
in
these
proceedings
whether
they
be
administrative,
the
judicial
or
the
legislative
and
use
its
powers
under
title
28,
section
2283
to
protect
or
effectuate
its
judgments,
to
use
its
powers
under
title
28,
section
2202
to
grant
further
relief.
mr.
william
wenzel
that
is
correct,
but
i
think
that
what
they
could
do
is
at
each
step
of
the
proceeding
whether
administrative
or
judicial
[voice
overlap]
they
can
keep
on
intruding
into
legitimate
state
affairs
and
nudging
this
matter
closer
and
closer
to
the
point
where
payment
will
occur
even
though
it
couldn't
be
said
directly
that
the
federal
court
actually
ordered
it.
it
did
everything,
but
in
fact
order
it
and
we
feel
that,
that
is
so
closely
tide
up
with
the
actual
award
of
monetary
relief
itself
that
it
really
amounts
to
a
subterfuge.
mr.
william
wenzel
it
said
that
it
envisioned
a
notice
which
would
not
contain
a
predetermination
of
the
liability
of
the
state.
it
did,
whatever
notice
it
might
send
out
however
i
think
would
include
the
right
to
appeal
this
denial
of
benefits
in
the
period
of
1968
to
1971.
once
we
trigger
the
fair
hearing
process
everything
else
follows,
judicial
review,
court
of
claims,
the
legislative
matters.
mr.
william
wenzel
but
assuming
that
the
federal
court
would
retain
power
to
enforce
and
protect
its
notice
relief,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
-
the
court
is
not
merely
--
the
court
stands
ready
to
intrude
into
state
law
and
state
procedure
to
see
the
desired
result
of
an
eventual
monetary
award
realized.
mr.
william
wenzel
maybe
another
way
of
approaching
the
problem
is
to
attempt
to
delineate
what
edelman
precludes
in
the
way
of
a
federal
court's
remedial
power
for
relief.
this
notice
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
is
not
perspective.
it
must
be
deemed
to
be
compensatory.
it
is
not
perspective,
because
the
only
perspective
injunctive
relief
that
was
dealt
with
in
1971
and
1972,
were
federal
time
standards.
there
has
never
been
a
question
of
notice
relief
in
this
case.
that
leaves
us
with
notice
relief
which
is
designed
to
compensate
for
pre-litigation
conduct.
and
this
court
said
in
edelman
that
compensatory
relief,
dealing
with
past
completed
misconduct
is
beyond
the
powers
of
the
federal
court,
when
the
objection
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
raised.
mr.
william
wenzel
the
answer
would
be
no.
it
would
i
suppose
they
could
come
--
the
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
would
be
able
to
come
into
the
offices
of
public
aid
and
request
to
appeal
the
denial
of
benefits
--
mr.
william
wenzel
yes,
but
it
would
not
be
as
a
result
of
a
federal
court's
order
over
the
objection
of
the
state
that
it
is
in
violation
of
its
right
to
be
free
from
suit
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
william
wenzel
well,
especially
in
the
very
litigation
in
which
the
prohibition
of
an
award
of
monetary
benefits
had
been
precluded
by
this
very
court,
we
feel
that
very
strongly
that
what
is
happening
here
is
they
are
attempting
to
achieve
the
ultimate
goal
of
retroactive
benefits
by
indirection
and
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
aiding
and
abetting
this
indirection,
we
feel,
in
violation
of
this
courts'
decision
and
certainly
inconsistently
with
the
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
because,
because
of
the
federal
order
to
grant
notice
relief,
there
will
be
a
significant
intrusion
upon
the
state
affairs.
these
hearings
would
of
necessity
follow,
judicial
review
would
follow
and
i
think
it
does
matter
significantly
mr.
justice
stevens
that
this
would
occur
as
a
result
of
a
federal
court
order
and
not
merely
because
some
do
gooder
at
his
own
cost
and
expense
--
mr.
william
wenzel
there
is
one
significant
difference.
at
this
point
in
the
proceedings,
the
only
way
that
the
names
and
identities
of
those
people
who
have
been
denied
benefits
in
the
past
would
be
able
to
be
put
together
and
disseminate
it
would
be
as
result
of
a
federal
court
order
which
viewed
notice
relief
and
the
identity
of
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
as
part
of
some
prospective
relief
which
it
had
the
power
to
require
the
state
to
put
together
and
disseminate.
so
a
do-gooder
really
just
putting
out
a
notice
as
to
your
--
mr.
william
wenzel
i
think
that
notice
relief
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
in
any
form
cannot
be
deemed
to
be
consistent
with
the
principles
of
federalism
which
are
embodied
in
the
eleventh
amendment.
those
principles
of
federalism
require
that
there
be
a
respect
for
both
the
federal
sovereigns
and
the
state
sovereigns
and
that
each
sovereign
should
to
free
to
act
consistently
within
its
own
sphere
of
operation
under
our
constitution
in
edelman
versus
jordan
and
in
ex
parte
versus
young,
this
court
attempted
to
make
sure
that
both
the
reaches
and
proper
applications
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
well
as
eleventh
amendment
are
given
their
full
play
as
long
as
one
does
not
require
the
lessening
or
the
weakening
of
the
other.
if
we
are
to
believe
what
plaintiff
say
in
this
case
about
the
notions
of
federalism?
in
effect,
we
will
have
federal
courts'
being
able
to
grant
relief,
which
effectively
renders
the
eleventh
amendment
a
hollow
shell.
our
notion
of
federalism
as
evidenced
by
the
distinction
between
perspective
equitable
relief
and
retroactive
relief
recognized
in
edelman
we
think
is
the
proper
balance
and
this
court
was
able
to
work
with
the
edelman
distinction
between
retrospective
and
prospective
in
the
milliken
versus
bradley
case.
it
was
able
to
find
a
justification
for
wiping
out
ongoing
incidences
of
any
quality
in
the
detroit
school
system,
by
granting
prospective
relief
which
contained
remedial
reading
programs.
the
distinction
between
prospective
and
retroactive
when
applied
to
this
particular
case,
however,
shows
that
we
are
talking
about
relief,
which
is
measured
in
the
teams
of
past
breach
of
legal
duty.
mr.
william
wenzel
mr.
chief
justices
and
may
i
please
court.
if
there
are
no
specific
questions
of
petitioners
counsel
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
wenzel
in
response
to
counsel’s
comments,
i’d
like
to
return
to
what
i
think
are
two
crucial
facts
that
are
particular
to
this
case
which
are
decisive
of
the
issue
of
whether
any
form
of
notice
relief
is
appropriate
under
this
court’s
decision
in
edelman
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
those
two
facts
are;
one,
when
plaintiff
brought
his
compliant
in
federal
court
in
1971,
he
alleged
that
he
had
no
available
administrative
remedies,
paragraphs
27
and
39
of
the
compliant,
appendix
a12
and
a14,
he
purposefully
chose
to
ignore
his
right
to
seek
a
hearing
in
state
court
and
now
some
six
or
seven
years
later
he
is
back
in
court
saying
that
now
he
is
entitled
to
notice.
the
second
crucial
fact
--
mr.
william
wenzel
that
is
correct
in
fact,
the
plaintiff
mr.
justice
marshall
if
mr.
jordan
has
received
his
retroactive
benefits,
he
would
not
even
be
seeking.
the
second
crucial
fact
i
believe
is
that
in
1974
congress
repealed
former
title
16
of
the
social
security
act.
any
right
to
notice
or
hearing
which
members
of
the
plaintiff
class
may
have
had
in
1971,
i
believe
are
extinguished
by
the
fact
that
there
are
no
longer
any
rights
or
obligations
with
respect
to
notice,
which
are
binding
in
--
mr.
william
wenzel
well,
we
back
up
to
whether
or
not
the
notice.
whether
or
not
it
will
also
--
mr.
william
wenzel
insofar
is
noticeable
trigger
the
request
for
hearings,
the
hearing
themselves
judicial
review,
possible
action
by
the
legislative
is
triggering
governmental
machinery,
which
is
far
as
we
are
concerned
substantially
intrudes
upon
the
sovereign
and
violates
the
sovereign’s
freedom
form
suit.
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
stated
that
the
state
officer
is
not
seeking
to
protect
the
state,
but
to
block
access
of
state
remedies
and
i
think
we
have
sufficiently
dealt
with
that,
for
the
fact
that
we
no
longer
are
operating
under
a
formal
title
16.
federalism,
plaintiff’s
assert
requires
a
balancing
of
the
competing
interest
of
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
i
think
what
plaintiff
is
trying
to
do
in
this
case
is
confuse
the
notion
of
federalism
as
used
in
cases
in
younger
v.
harris,
which
i
understand
is
a
prudential
notion
of
federalism,
with
the
federalism
that
is
inherited
in
every
eleventh
amendment
controversy.
federalism
here
must
take
into
account
that
the
eleventh
amendment
renders
an
absolute
bar
to
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
this
court
has
said
so
in
monaco
versus
mississippi
and
the
eleventh
amendment
must
be
given
effect
as
far
as
it
reaches.
so,
it
is
not
really
a
question
of
balancing
the
interest
and
for
ever
violation
of
federal
law
there
must
be
a
remedy.
the
point
is
that
of
the
suit
is
essentially
against
the
state.
the
state
is
free
to
assert
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
suit.
thank
you.
