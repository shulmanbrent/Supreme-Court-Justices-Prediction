mr.
james
b.
hovis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
pleases
the
court.
if
i
could
just
take
a
moment
to
respond
to
the
last
question.
this
37.10
--
the
37.12.010
has
only
to
do
with
indians.
and
as
justice
white
has
pointed
out
right
in
the
first
part,
it
says
it
assumes
jurisdiction
over
indians
only
and
it
does
not
assume
any
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
by
the
37.12.010.
the
state's
assumption
of
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
within
the
reservation
fall
from
the
mcbratney
and
the
draper
exception.
so
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
the
mcbratney
exception
where
it's
indian
against
--
where
it's
non-indian
against
non-indian,
which
is
a
case
of
this
court
that
creates
without
exception.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
non-indian
against
an
indian,
that
is
in
federal
court
except
where
it's
--
what
i'm
saying
in
--
if
there's
an
indian
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
for
--
it
is
purported
to
assume
jurisdiction.
in
some
cases,
it
is
a
-–
it
depends
on
what
prosecutor
you're
talking
to.
it
--
this
act
is
a
rather
confusing
one
for
all
of
us
to
deal
with
because
it's
so
open
that
the
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
it
just
deals
with
cases
in
which
indians
are
involved
and
it
deals
with
indian
defendants.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
there
is
no
such
washington
act
and
i'm
just
going
from
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute,
37.12.010.
the
state
has
interpreted
it
different
prosecutor
by
prosecutor
in
different
areas.
it
depends
on
who
doesn't
want
to
do
the
job
when
the
complainant
comes
to
the
particular
prosecutor,
but
i
direct
your
attention
to
the
plain
reading
of
the
act
as
to
whether
it
affects
indians
or
non-indians.
in
the
treaty
in
1855,
the
yakima
nation
was
reserved
explicitly
and
implicitly
the
right
to
control
its
internal
affairs
by
its
own
laws
and
by
its
own
government.
and
for
a
good
number
of
years,
the
yakima
nation
exercised
that
right
with
responsibility.
a
time
in
1953,
they
were
exercising
that
right
of
control
within
the
exterior
boundaries
of
the
reservation
with
responsibility
and
congress,
because
of
other
areas
of
the
country
were
not
exercising
the
responsibility,
passed
public
law
280.
this
act
provided
directly
for
state
jurisdiction
in
five
listed
states
and
provided
for
assumption
by
statute
in
ten
other
states,
and
in
washington
and
seven
other
states
provided
for
assumption
of
state
jurisdiction
by
the
amendment
of
the
state
constitution.
in
1955,
in
the
first
legislative
session
after
that
act,
washington's
--
the
proponents
of
state
jurisdiction
over
indians
tried
to
get
a
statutory
--
constitutional
amendment
for
the
legislature.
they
--
they
did
not
amend
their
constitution.
in
1957,
they
provided
by
legislative
act
that
the
tribes
who
wished
jurisdiction
could
petition
for
jurisdiction.
ten
did,
others
didn't.
it's
interesting
to
note
however
that
even
the
tribes
who
have
given
it
a
fair
trial
and
who
wished
jurisdiction
because
of
their
experience
they've
had
for
the
lack
of
adequate
protection
are
petitioning
this
court
in
amicus
brief
to
be
removed
from
state
jurisdiction
in
the
state
of
washington.
we
came
to
1963
and
unilaterally
and
without
amendment
of
their
state
constitution,
the
state
of
washington
passed
37.12.010.
and
this
act
allowed
the
state
to
assume
full
jurisdiction
over
non-trust
lands
and
assumed
partial
jurisdiction
over
trust
lands
for
eight
non-specified
or
non-defined
or
non-referred
categories.
the
rest
of
the
jurisdiction
over
indians
and
indian
matters
remained
with
the
tribe
and
with
the
federal
government.
and
so
we
had
about
four
different
systems
underneath
this
act
for
law
enforcement
officers
to
become
familiar
with.
now,
the
result
of
this
unilateral
action
by
the
--
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
washington
contrary
to
the
treaty
promises
the
yakima's,
has
been
law
without
order
on
the
yakima
reservation.
the
record
is
clear
in
this
case
that
the
system
is
not
adequate
to
handle
the
problem.
the
state
has
admitted
that
their
system
is
not
adequate
in
two
reports
into
which
we
referred
to.
and
it
is
particularly,
and
our
biggest
problem,
it's
particularly
discriminatory
in
causing
a
lot
of
tribe
problems
as
regards
our
indian
youth.
the
problem
is
that
the
state
and
county
have
neither
the
inclination
nor
ability
to
provide
law
and
order
that
they
so
unilaterally
assumed
over
our
objections.
mr.
gorton
had
his
map
here
and
he
pointed
out
the
vast
area
of
the
yakima
reservation
over
2,000
square
miles
and
there's
deeded
and
non-trust
lands
sprinkled
throughout
even
in
the
closed
area.
but
if
you
will
notice
from
the
record
that
in
1971,
which
was
the
last
available
figures
that
were
available
at
that
time
this
case
was
heard
in
1972,
the
state
made
two
felony
arrest
outside
of
the
cities
and
towns,
often
this
vast
areas
and
17
misdemeanor
arrests.
unfortunately
gentlemen,
the
reservation
law
and
order
system
under
washington
system
does
not
either
meet
any
national
standards.
it
doesn't
meet
any
parity
statewide
standards.
sure,
we
have
as
good
at
reservation
--
a
good
law
and
order
as
they
do
in
some
other
bad
parts.
it
has
no
parity
with
cities
and
it
has
no
parity
if
you
please
with
other
parts
to
the
county.
if
you'll
notice
that
while
they're
talking
about
40
deputies
assigned
to
the
county
today,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
there
were
29
and
even
though
the
whole
area
of
the
county
is
only
4,700
square
miles,
only
two
were
principally
assigned
to
the
reservation,
which
is
over
half
that
area,
and
only
seven
were
assigned
to
the
entire
lower
valley
which
has
a
bigger
population
than
the
rest
of
the
rural
area.
now,
what
has
happened
here
is
been
a
decline
of
arrests
of
over
2000%
above
and
beyond
the
time
when
the
indians
were
--
that
was
any
federal
government
was
handling
the
responsibility
and
the
juvenile
situation
is
a
scandal,
and
that's
our
biggest
problem.
washington
in
its
reports
agrees
to
the
lack
of
adequacy,
if
you'll
see
in
the
record.
and
the
county
officials,
particularly
in
the
testimony
were
particularly
agreed
that
it
was
discriminatory,
that
there
was
more
factors
available
for
non-indian
youth
than
there
was
for
indian
youth.
now,
if
there
is
to
--
going
to
be
law
and
order
in
the
yakima
reservation,
we
must
regain
our
law
and
order
and
we're
here
today
to
see
whether
underneath
the
law,
it
is
ours.
the
yakima's
throughout
all
this
time
and
are
today
been
very
responsible
on
this.
in
spite
of
the
unwarranted
intrusions
into
their
jurisdiction,
they're
spending
per
capita,
spending
per
capita
for
each
and
every
member
more
for
law
and
order
than
any
other
community
in
the
united
states,
even
though
they
have
not
got
the
total
responsibility.
washington
as
i
said
in
contrast
refers
to
meet
any
--
refuses
to
meet
any
reasonable
standards.
now,
as
i
understand
my
duty
to
this
court,
it
is
first
my
duty
to
indicate
to
this
court
why
i
believe
that
37.12.010
should
not
pertain
to
the
yakima
indian
nation
before
i
get
into
the
constitutional
grounds.
now,
i
think
that
can
be
easily
demonstrated,
gentlemen.
undis
--
it
is
undisputed
by
all
the
parties
here
that
the
treaty
with
the
yakima's
explicitly
and
implicitly
reserved
the
yakima
powers
over
their
internal
affairs
to
be
governed
by
their
own
laws
and
by
their
own
government.
now,
the
state
of
washington
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes
sir.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
but
it
--
is
--
if
the
--
the
record
shows
that
in
the
--
prior
to
the
state
coming
in,
in
63
that
were
some
17,
i
think
it
was,
of
felony
arrests,
in
other
words,
the
felony
arrests
decreased
by
2000%.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
most
of
the
enforcement
if
you
please
has
--
was
by
tribal
authorities
which
turned
them
over
to
the
federal
government
for
prosecution.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
now
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
no,
and
we're
doing
the
job
now.
we're
done
--
we're
doing
the
job
now.
we've
got
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
well,
the
first
place
--
let
me
take
first
for
a
victim,
justice,
let
me
take
a
victim.
who
does
he
go
to?
who
does
the
victim
go
to?
he
doesn't
go
to
the
state
and
call
the
state.
does
he
call
the
tribe?
the
--
the
county
doesn't
even
have
a
telephone
for
their
--
you
have
to
call
long
distance
to
get
the
county
sheriff.
who
do
you
go
to?
you
go
to
the
tribal
authorities
and
so
forth.
once
the
tribal
authority
goes
out
and
investigates,
he
--
you
take
it
up
to
the
prosecutors.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
he
went
to
the
tribe,
well,
usually
and
then
--
and
the
fbi
accepted
it.
we
had
a
lot
of
--
we
had
a
lot
more
cooperation.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
you
take
--
you
can
arrest
the
person
but
you
can't
get
him
prosecuted.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
but
the
federal
government
prosecute
and
the
state
does
not.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
well,
the
biggest
problem
is
that
the
people,
the
victims
are
so
confused.
they
don't
know
where
to
go
to.
they
don't
know
what
law
is.
the
police
officers
don't
know
what
it
is.
they
don't
know
what
category.
what
is
the
domestic
relation,
for
example.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
okay.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
now,
for
a
--
generally,
among
--
practically
among
law
enforcement
officers,
they
tend
to
respect
each
other's
jurisdiction.
the
--
for
example,
the
fbi
wouldn't
anymore
be
going
into
a
matter
into
a
local
--
getting
away
from
the
indian
situation
but
no
--
more
go
into
a
state
and
start
investigating
a
crime
until
they
were
requested
by
another
department.
that's
just
one
of
the
ways
that
it
works.
departments
respect
other
department's
jurisdiction.
so,
they
give
the
other
department
the
first
crack
at
it.
that's
the
first
thing
that
happens.
that's
the
reason.
then
we've
got
the
tract
system.
no
one
can
tell
in
our
reservation
whether
it
is
deeded
property
or
trust
property.
these
tracts
are
all
interspaced
and
non-indians
live
on
the
indian
lands
or
trust
lands
and
indians
lived
on
deeded
lands.
no
one
knows
just
exactly
what
the
title
of
the
land
is.
now,
that's
the
next
problem.
and
then
we
get
to
the
problem
of
the
eight
categories.
what
are
the
eight
categories?
what
is
--
for
example
domestic
relations?
what
kind
of
a
crime
is
domestic
relations
involved
that
you
can't
even
find
the
definition
of
what
domestic
relations
is
in
a
law
dictionary?
is
it
domestic
relations
problem?
is
it
a
--
is
this
kind
of
a
problem?
it's
frankly.
i
suggest
that
--
i
suggest
that
it's
confusing
enough
for
me
as
a
prosecuting
attorney
testified
at
the
trial
--
he
said
every
prosecutor
interprets
it
in
a
different
way.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
they
do.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
there
is
an
assimilative
crimes
act.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
the
federal
--
if
it's
a
misdemeanor
--
you
see,
if
we
have
jurisdiction,
if
it's
a
federal
crime,
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
control
over
the
13
major
crimes.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
they
just
meet
--
some
of
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
that's
correct.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
they
are.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
that's
correct.
all
crimes
are
covered
by
tribal
law
where
the
federal
government
has
not
taken
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
so
if
the
federal
government
doesn't
prosecute,
we
can
still
prosecute
not
for
a
felony
but
at
least
we
can
prosecute,
at
least
the
person
just
doesn't
beat
the
police
officer
back
to
his
home.
and
the
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
what?
mr.
james
b.
hovis
there
is.
unfortunately,
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
maximum
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
six
months
and
$500.00.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
and
we
think
that's
unwise
on
the
part
of
congress
but
that's
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
there
it
is.
and
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
no,
we
can
only
punish
--
but
it's
better
to
punish
them
for
that
than
walk
down
them
down
the
road,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
correct.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
it's
not
exclusive.
its
--
but
underneath
the
court's
decision
here,
we
have
no
concurrent
jurisdiction
whatsoever.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
it
is
our
claim
that
we're
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
it
was
decided
that
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
not
by
this
court
of
appeals,
but
the
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes
sir.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
sir.
that's
--
that's
correct.
but
what
i'm
saying,
we
don't
have
it
now
because
of
the
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
well,
as
i
understood
this
court's
decision
in
weeks
versus
delaware,
they
said
that
lone
wolf
versus
hitchcock
was
--
has
been
ignored
by
this
court
for
some
50
years
and
that
it
was
about
time
that
this
court
said
so,
and
i
was
--
and
i
understand
that
weeks,
it's
a
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
well,
i
--
this
--
i
suggest
that
this
--
i
was
hopeful
in
the
reading
of
weeks
that
this
court
had
determined
that
the
--
that
congress,
when
it
came
to
doing
away
with
treaty
provisions,
would
have
to
act
in
a
constitutional
manner
in
that
regard
and
that's
the
way
i
interpreted
the
decision
of
this
court
in
weeks
versus
delaware.
and
also,
in
menominee,
i
understood
this
court
to
say
that
you
must
specifically
and
explicitly
abrogate
treaty
rights.
you
can't
do
it
by
implication
and
it
must
be
done
clearly.
so,
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
congress
neither
explicitly
or
specifically
abrogated
these
treaty
rights.
and
it's
also
clear,
as
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
that
congress
clearly
intended
to
exclude
the
yakima's
because
of
the
hurried
manner
in
which
this
act
was
put
together
--
and
i
suggest
that
neither
the
federal
act
nor
the
state
act
as
any
specimen
of
good
legislation
drafting
--
but
in
the
hurried
enactment
of
that
legislation,
the
yakima's
were
not
excluded.
if
they
had
been
one
of
the
named
states,
they
would
have
been
excluded.
they
were
--
their
law
and
order
was
satisfactory
and
it
was
recommended
to
congress
that
they
be
excluded.
now,
washington
has
contended
in
this
case
that
washington
can
assume
jurisdiction
over
the
yakima's
in
any
way
or
manner
that
washington
in
this
whole
judgment
determines.
they're
saying
it
was
up
to
the
state
to
determine
whether
they
could
ignore
the
mandatory
provisions
of
their
constitution,
and
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
that's
what
they've
done.
they've
ignored.
they
didn't
even
--
they
didn't
even
amend
the
article
xxvi
of
their
constitution
even
by
a
legislative
act.
it
still
sits
there.
whatever
amendment
article
xxvi
there
is,
it's
by
implication
only.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
oh,
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think
that's
an
issue
here.
first,
i
think
it's
an
issue
in
interpreting
what
congress
did.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
that's
a
federal
question.
in
other
words,
for
the
state
of
washington
to
have
different
rules
in
amending
sections
that
apply
to
indians
and
allowing
it
to
be
done
by
implication,
when
you
get
over
here
where
you've
got
another
section
that
applies
to
the
rest
of
the
populace
or
other
problems,
they
have
to
go
through
the
mandatory
amendment
procedures.
for
the
supreme
court
to
come
up
with
that
kind
of
a
decision
i
think
is
a
lack
of
due
process,
substantial
due
process.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
it
is.
it
has
been
made
all
the
way
through
this
case
if
your
court
please,
and
it
also
i
think,
it
intend
--
it
shows
that
the
congress
is
right
when
they
asked
this
court
to
--
when
they
asked
the
state
of
washington
to
amend
their
constitution
because
if
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
if
--
well,
i
think
there
right
--
yes,
i
think
its
necessary
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
it's
a
necessary
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
the
--
whether
the
state
has
to
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
it's
a
matter
of
state
constitutional
law
but
the
state
no
matter
has
to
follow
the
constitutional
provisions
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
and
they
must
do
things
in
a
due
process
and
with
equal
protection
way.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes,
whether
it's
a
constitution
or
whether
it's
a
statute,
and
they
haven't
done
that.
they
haven't
accorded
this
due
process
in
the
amendment
of
the
constitution.
if
that's
due
process,
that's
something
i
didn't
--
you
know,
that's
the
kind
of
action
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
no,
but
it
can
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
congress
can't
tell
them
how
they
may
amend
their
constitution.
but
congress,
this
is
a
power
that
was
solely
with
the
united
states
of
america,
the
relationship
between
indians
and
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
b.
hovis
congress
can
say
if
you
--
we
are
delegating
this
federal
power
to
you
over
indians.
but
before
you
can
accept
this
federal
power
over
indians,
you
must
amend
your
constitution
in
the
way
that
we
say
you
must
amend
it.
and
it's
clear
in
this
case
that
congress
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
yes.
no,
it's
the
--
the
state
law
is
interpreted
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
if
state
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
it
is
different.
if
state
law
is
--
mr.
james
b.
hovis
the
--
congress
cannot
tell
the
state
how
to
amend
its
constitution.
but
if
they're
going
to
delegate
the
powers
to
the
state,
like
in
this
case,
they
can
tell
them
what
to
do,
and
they
did.
they
told
them
they
had
to
do
it
by
the
people,
and
that's
what
they've
done.
i
really
question
in
this
case
that
the
matter
is
up
whether
congress
could
make
such
an
unfettered
delegation
at
any
way.
these
legislative
and
judicial
powers
that
are
definitely
federal
are
vested
with
the
federal
government,
not
with
the
state
government.
and
such
a
--
such
a
lose
delegation
of
--
as
counsel
would
argue
that
they
can
--
that
it
was
said
to
the
state
to
do
it
any
way
that
you
want
to
or
any
way
that
your
laws
permit
is
not
what
i
think
congress
did
nor
something
that
i
think
congress
can
do.
i
think
to
delegate
this
exclusive
federal
power
in
such
an
unfettered
manner
is
not
within
congress'
powers.
finally,
we
reach
the
question
of
the
circuit
court's
decision
of
this
being
on
equal
protection
underneath
the
laws
of
not
providing
protection
based
on
the
title
of
the
land.
and
the
circuit
court
said
that
that
provision
was
not
equal
protection
and
therefore,
that
portion
of
the
section
under
1963
would
be
stricken
as
unconstitutional.
now,
i
think
the
court
was
very
clear
on
that.
they
didn't
go
into
whether
there
would
be
strict
scrutiny
or
not.
they
said
there
was
no
rational
basis.
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
however
that
the
rational
basis
that
the
state
has
come
up
here
at
this
very
late
date
is
a
very
-–
is
new,
never
been
brought
into
this
case
before,
and
is
inconsistent
from
their
present
position
and
inconsistent
with
their
position
before
this
court
in
docket
78-119.
in
that
case,
in
the
fishing
matters,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington
is
saying
that
in
regards
to
indians
and
non-indians,
that
there
are
--
in
regards
to
the
treaty
rights
that
there
can
be
no
differentiation
or
it's
a
violation
of
equal
protection
of
both
state
and
federal
constitution
there.
so,
the
state
is
trying
to
have
it
this
way
in
this
case
and
the
other
way
in
the
other
case
and
it's
certainly
a
new
rationale
that
they
came
up
with.
i
would
like
to
have
the
court
consider
also
in
this
matter
that
strict
scrutiny
should
apply.
it's
true
that
this
is
not
a
racial
situation
but
certainly,
my
clients
are
discreet
and
hence,
we're
minority.
and
certainly,
the
rights
involved,
the
rights,
the
protection
of
person
and
property
are
most
fundamental.
and
if
it's
necessary,
i
would
like
to
have
the
court
give
that
consideration.
i
do
not
think
--
i
don't
think
that
there's
--
even
this
new
fancied
rationale
that
the
state
comes
up
with
at
this
late
stage
which
is
inconsistent
from
any
position
that
they've
ever
taken
that
the
court
will
be
necessary
to
reach
that
question.
there's
no
question
that
the
clearest
and
easiest
way
to
reach
this
question
is
on
the
constitutional
disclaimer
problem.
i
certainly
think
that
that
is
most
clear.
thank
you
very
much
for
your
time.
