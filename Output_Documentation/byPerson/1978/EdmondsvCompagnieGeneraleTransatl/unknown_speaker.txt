unknown
speaker
so,
mr.
breit
supposing
this
case
had
originate
had
risen
interstate
common
law
tort
situation
and
the
trial
court
have
mistakenly
submitted
interrogatories
regarding
comparative
fault
to
the
jury
and
they
found
20%
in
one
party,
7%
on
the
other,
it
goes
the
highest
court
as
the
highest
court
of
the
state
says
the
trial
court
was
wrong
we
don't
have
comparative
fault,
we
just
have
traditional,
ordinary
negligence.
could
it
uphold
a
verdict
against
the
20%
liable
party
for
the
entire
amount?
unknown
speaker
your
submission
mr.
breit
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
statutory
language
in
question
was
intended
to
do
no
more
than
to
preserve
the
rule
of
reed
against
yaka?
unknown
speaker
that's
it?
unknown
speaker
would
you
state
it
for
me
again.
unknown
speaker
you
were
saying
he
was
to
preserve
or
to
overrule
reed
against
yaka?
unknown
speaker
is
his
own
stevedore?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
there
the
stevedore
was
the
bearable
charter,
i
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
--
unknown
speaker
for
unseaworthiness?
unknown
speaker
right.
but
that
was
an
--
wasn't
reed
an
unseaworthiness
case?
unknown
speaker
of
unseaworthiness?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
did
the
case
--
i
did
sense
that
the
thing
that
puzzled
me
is
i
didn't
understand
the
case
to
decide
any
negligence
issue.
unknown
speaker
but
it
held
that
a
--
when
a
stevedore
was
both
stevedore
and
shipowner,
you
could
sue
him
as
shipowner
despite
of
then
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
his
liability
depended
upon
unseaworthiness
or
negligence
was
really
not
the
issue
in
the
yaka
case
although
it
was
an
unseaworthiness
claim.
now,
that
unseaworthiness
has
now
been
eliminated
by
congress.
unknown
speaker
but
your
contention
at
least
is
that
this
statutory
language
at
issue
in
this
case
was
to
preserve
the
rule
of
reed
against
yaka
with
fundamental
rule
that
when
a
person
is
both
stevedore
and
shipowner,
he
can
be
sued
as
shipowner?
unknown
speaker
and
you
concede
that
the
damages
should
be
reduced
by
the
percentage
of
the
plaintiff's
fault,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
and
no
question,
that's
not
at
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
i
hate
to
reveal
my
stupidity
so
frequently
but
the
second
sentence
is
what's
critical
here
and
it's
your
critical
part
of
your
argument
as
i
understand
and
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
do
catch
it.
because
the
sentence
says
if
such
person
was
employed
by
the
vessel
that
provide
stevedoring
services,
no
such
action
shall
be
permitted
if
the
injury
and
so
forth.
are
you
saying
it
was
to
preserve
the
action
rather
than
to
prevent
it?
unknown
speaker
but
it
says
no
such
action
shall
be
permitted
against
him
that's
why
i'm
so
fangled
about
it.
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
next
sentence.
maybe
i'm
reading
the
wrong
sentence.
if
such
person
was
employed
by
the
vessel
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
construed
that
sentence
as
primarily
preserving
a
claim
rather
than
destroying
a
claim.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
okay.
unknown
speaker
it's
very
unavoidable
doing
it,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
you
would
grant
at
least
that
it's
inartfully
drafted,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
an
admiralty
law
doctrine?
that's
a
common
law.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
question
about
this
example.
see
the
plaintiff
is
an
employee
of
the
shipowner
performing
stevedoring
services
and
he
wants
to
sue
the
shipowner
for
negligence
unrelated
to
the
stevedoring
services.
do
you
say
he
can
or
he
cannot?
unknown
speaker
but
even
though
he
is
an
employee,
he
may
sue
for
negligence,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
okay.
i
understood
your
position
now.
unknown
speaker
who
shut
them
down?
unknown
speaker
saying
that
this
wasn't
the
intent
of
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
mr.
regalton.
unknown
speaker
but
hasn't
that
kind
of
comparative
negligence
always
been
part
of
admiralty
law?
unknown
speaker
why
--
unknown
speaker
why
did
it
have
to
be?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see
and
therefore
--
unknown
speaker
reduced
by
his
own
by
the
percentage
of
his
own
negligence?
unknown
speaker
apparently,
there's
no
issue?
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
that
liability
would
be
reduced.
unknown
speaker
then
you're
contention
would
be
--
unknown
speaker
--
$18,000.00?
unknown
speaker
$20,000.00
--
unknown
speaker
--
reduced
by
--
to
$18,000.00
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tucker,
under
the
district
court's
judgment
of
$90,000.00,
$50,000.00
would
have
been
paid
by
the
stevedore,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
mean
that
the
$90,000.00
but
wouldn't
it
be
credited
against
the
$90,000.00
the
$50,000.00
receiving
compensation?
unknown
speaker
and
it
get
back
$50,000.00.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
the
net
payment
by
the
shipowner
would
have
been
$40,000.00,
is
that?
unknown
speaker
the
net
payment?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
$50,000.00?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
the
stevedore
will
come
in
his
home
free
basically?
unknown
speaker
is
that
true
in
the
law
and
land-based
negligence
law
if
you
have
two
joint
tortfeasors
and
the
plaintiff
elects
to
sue
only
one
of
them
and
collects
for
all
his
damages
even
though
that
one
is
only
20%
at
fault
and
somebody
else's
who's
not
sued
is
80%
at
fault.
the
person
not
sued
gets
off
scot-free
if
--
unknown
speaker
no.
you
acted
so
shocked
at
the
inequity
and
i
my
question
was
directed
as
in
their
similar
inequity
in
ordinary
tort
law,
land-based.
unknown
speaker
but
normally,
i
mean
the
common
rule
was
there
was
no
contribution
on
joint
tortfeasors?
unknown
speaker
i'll
translate
that
mr.
tucker
--
unknown
speaker
--
under
these
figures
again.
unknown
speaker
under
that
approach,
the
shipowner
would
pay
how
much
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
to
the
longshoreman?
unknown
speaker
and
the
longshoreman
would
receive
from
the
stevedore
the
$50,000.00.
unknown
speaker
and
so
the
consequence
with
is
that
instead
of
under
the
district
court
judgment
where
the
stevedore
pays
nothing
in
effect
--
unknown
speaker
--
he
now
will
be
paying
the
$50,000.00
plus.
unknown
speaker
but
under
the
courts
of
appeals
rational
would
the
stevedore
have
any
subrogation
rights
against
--
to
get
any
part
of
this
$20,000.00?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
a
great
big
interesting
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
rely
on
your
brief.
i'm
sure
you
talked
about
it.
that
issue
is
not
covered
by
the
question
presented
by
the
certiorari
petition
either
--
unknown
speaker
but
your
argument
you've
been
making
to
is
based
upon
the
right
of
recovery
by
the
stevedore
under
the
district
court's
theory?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
your
point
is
that
the
shipowner
under
the
district
court's
construction
pays
it
all
and
he
pays
it
all
because
the
stevedore
has
a
right
of
subrogation
to
get
back
this
sum
$50,000.00
and
you've
been
arguing
that
to
us.
unknown
speaker
but
then
gets
it
back
from
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
that's
an
important
part
of
your
equitable
argument?
unknown
speaker
and
even
though
that
perhaps
is
not
specifically
governed
by
–
covered
by
the
question.
unknown
speaker
and
the
lawsuit
is
a
matter
of
law
that
when
the
stevedore
is
70%
negligent
that
it
will
have
the
right
of
subrogation,
is
it?
that
has
been
settled,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
was
by
the
district
court
but
i
mean
is
it,
there
is
debate
in
the
scholarship
about
this,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
isn't
there
a
debate
on
whether
that
lien
may
be
enforced
when
the
stevedore
is
70%
negligent.
unknown
speaker
all
i'm
asking
isn't
there
a
difference
of
opinion
on
that
issue?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there's
a
--
what
if
the
liability
of
the
shipowner
is
limited
to
the
degree
of
his
fall
which
is
$100,000.00
damages
and
this
determine
that
the
shipowner
is
negligent
for
25%
of
it.
and
he
has
to
pay
$25,000.00.
unknown
speaker
and
then
the
stevedore
gets
his
money
back?
unknown
speaker
you
just
said
always
he's
going
to
get
his
money
back.
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
he
would
get
his
money
back?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
on
the
face
of
the
law,
he
does
have
a
lien
on
the
recovery?
unknown
speaker
up
to
the
ceiling
of
--
of
what
he's
paid?
--
what
he's
paid,
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
that
then
if
he
is
paid
more
than
the
$25,000.00,
he
get's
it
all?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
way
it
looks
on
the
face
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stevens
is
really
is
yes,
there
is
difference
in
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
a
fair
major
damage
as
an
accident,
is
it
an
accident
is
it
is
$100,000.00.
and
the
stevedore
--
the
stevedore's
limit
however
is
under
the
act.
i
mean
he
is
--
the
absolute
limit
of
what
he
has
to
pay
is
whatever
the
act
provides.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
i
suppose,
if
it's
a
proportionate
fault
rule
obtains
and
the
shipowner
say
we're
limited
a
liability
$25,000.00
and
the
stevedore
only
had
to
pay
under
the
act
$25,000.00.
the
employee
is
out
$50,000.00
from
what
he
could
have
obtained
from
the
shipowner
except
for
apportionment.
unknown
speaker
was
that
right
or
wrong?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes.
yes,
right
or
wrong,
which
one
is
it?
is
it
right
or
is
it
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
is
it
the
stevedore
is
never
going
to
be
liable
for
any
more
than
what
his
--?
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
shipowner
pays
only
his
proportion
or
it's
the
fault.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
together
less
than
the
damage
is
somebody
is
out.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
by
--
you
would
construe
the
act
then
as
changing
the
ordinary
rule
of
liability
of
the
tortfeasor?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
joint
tortfeasor.
i
said
tortfeasor.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
contrary
to
the
ordinary
rule
a
tortfeasor
where
he
would
pay
even
though
only
25%
negligent
would
be
required
to
pay
if
there
were
judgment
against
him
a
100%
of
the
damages?
unknown
speaker
or
maybe
that
tortfeasor
is
way
back
beyond
the
jurisdiction
and
the
plaintiff
is
not
interested
in
suing
him
for
one
reason
or
another.
the
--
you
only
assume
as
one
tortfeasor.
that
tortfeasor
is
only
10%
at
fault.
he's
nonetheless
liable
for
100%
of
the
plaintiff's
damages.
unknown
speaker
but
he's
the
only
one
sued.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
court
here
find
that
out
that
there
were
two
tortfeasors?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
decided
that
one
contributed
25%
and
100%
or
whatever
the
percentage
is.
unknown
speaker
there
are
3%
weren't
they?
unknown
speaker
the
employee,
the
ship,
the
stevedore.
unknown
speaker
alright
he
may
not
be
liable
but
he
violated
a
duty
unknown
speaker
but
he
violated
a
duty
so
he's
a
tortfeasor.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
that
doesn't
make
him
a
tortfeasor?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
maritime
sometimes
calls
it
a
wrong
and
calls
it
instead
of
negligence,
he
calls
it
fault
but
it's
the
same
concepts.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tucker,
do
you
have
a
comment
on
your
opponent's
argument
that
the
second
sentence
of
the
statute
was
merely
intended
to
preserve
the
rule
of
the
yaka
case?
unknown
speaker
and
the
employee
weight
has
remedied
his
benefits
under
the
act
and
sued
the
shipowner?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
--
may
he?
unknown
speaker
and
then
but
you'd
still
say
apportionment?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
ask
that,
suing
for
negligence
may
recover
all
of
his
damages
from
the
shipowner
if
he
waives
his
right
against
the
stevedore.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
have
to
say
that
--
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
would
then
say
that
he
may
recover
from
the
ship
all
of
his
damages
even
if
the
ship
didn't
cause
it.
unknown
speaker
but
he
can't
decide
whether
the
act
applies,
can
he?
unknown
speaker
so
then
your
answer
is
no
to
mr.
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say,
i
didn't
ask
you
to
say
he
waives
--
he
just
tells
the
stevedore
don't
send
me
any
checks.
unknown
speaker
just
don't
send
me
anything,
i
won't
–
cause
i
know
what
to
get
from
you
which
is
very
little
and
i
know
what
i
can
get
from
the
ship.
i
can
recover
$100,000.00
and
i
only
get
$25,000.00
from
you.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
third
party
actions
are
very
normal
in
this
business.
but
is
it
not
correct
the
statute
doesn't
give
him
that
option?
unknown
speaker
if
he's
a
longshoreman
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
does
he
have
an
option
not
to
be
a
longshoreman?
nobody
has
an
option
not
to
apply
for
benefit.
unknown
speaker
and
he
certainly
can
sue
the
ship
under
the
act
because
he
did
hear
and
you
don't
say
that
he
can.
unknown
speaker
sure.
no
question
about
that.
