mr.
george
r.
kucik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
myself
to
the
questions
of
causation
and
damages.
the
first
question
is
causation
and
the
issue
there
is
simply
whether
there
was
enough
evidence
before
the
jury
from
which
it
could
reasonably
infer
that
perkins'
destruction
is
an
independent
marketer
of
gasoline
was
approximately
caused
by
the
price
discrimination
in
favor
of
signal
oil
and
gas
company.
now,
in
the
context
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
its
reversal,
the
causation
period
in
question
which
is
important
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
is
a
period
from
september
of
1956
through
december
of
1957
and
it
involves
in
the
beginning
the
portland
area
in
oregon.
the
parties
the
most
important
parties
for
signal
which
was
purchasing
gasoline
from
standard
and
regal
stations
company
which
was
marketing
the
gasoline
in
the
portland
area.
western
hyway
which
was
repurchasing
from
signal
was
trucking
the
gasoline
to
and
from
that
the
willbridge
terminal
to
the
retail
outlets.
now,
the
period
as
i
pointed
out
is
september
1956
through
december
1957.
immediately
prior
to
that
time,
none
of
the
members
of
signal's
corporate
family
were
in
the
portland
area.
signal
was
lifting
no
gasoline
from
standard's
wilbert's
terminal.
western
hyway
was
trucking
no
gasoline
and
there
were
no
regal
retail
outlets
in
portland.
in
late
august,
signal
began
its
first
lifting
at
willbridge.
regal
opened
its
first
station
in
portland
in
september
and
western
at
that
time
began
to
track
the
gasoline.
throughout
the
period,
there
was
an
admitted
discrimination
in
price
in
favor
of
signal
oil
and
gas
by
standard.
it
wasn't
always
admitted
or
in
fact
it
was
hardly
contested
prior
to
the
deposition
of
signal's
president
but
the
day
before
that
standard
admitted
the
discrimination
and
it's
an
admitted
fact
before
this
court.
so,
the
price
of
gasoline
was
always
lowered
going
into
the
signal
chain
of
distribution
at
wholesale
and
it
always
came
out
lower.
regal
consistently
underpriced
perkins
in
the
market
throughout
the
period.
indeed,
when
regal
first
opened
its
station,
it
dropped
retail
prices
by
four
cents.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
we
have
said
that
it
was
essential
to
prove
both,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
did
not
encompass
as
a
matter
of
law
the
activities
of
regal.
therefore,
the
regal
damage
is
caused
by
regal
could
not
become
a
part
of
the
verdict.
we
argue
that
the
statute
does
encompass
the
activities
of
regal.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
we
are
saying
that,
we
have
an
argument
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
that
is
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
that's
correct.
standard
has
contested
the
causation
on
the
--
is
contested
that
the
price
discrimination
to
signal
cause
perkins'
harm
at
the
retail
level
and
if
therefore
there
was
no
way
which
perkins
could've
been
injured
a
as
a
retailer
and
there
was
no
way
which
he
could've
been
injured
as
a
wholesaler
because
his
harm
as
a
wholesaler
was
derivative
harm
in
a
sense
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
his
retailers
were
getting
beat.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
no,
no.
the
ninth
circuit,
mr.
justice
white
--
as
i
read
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
they
decided
that
it
is
a
straight
question
of
law.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
we
addressed
ourselves
to
this
question
principally
because
it
is
the
overriding
question
in
standard's
brief.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
we
think
you
should
decide
the
causation
question.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
it
is
arguable
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
decide
it.
the
ninth
circuit
has
a
passage
in
a
footnote
6
of
its
opinion
where
it
says
even
granting
that
there
was
a
price
discrimination
in
favor
of
signal
and
even
granting
that
it
was
passed
on
to
regal,
we
hold
that
it's
not
actionable
and
they
went
on
to
give
some
reason.
that
can
be
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
the
reason
why
we
think
it's
arguable
that
that
was
a
holding
on
causation
was
there
was
no
question.
there
was
no
need
for
an
aguendo
on
the
question
of
the
discrimination
that
was
admitted.
so,
you
can
fairly
read
that
passage
as
a
holding
by
the
ninth
circuit
that
there
was
causation.
in
any
event,
the
jury
verdict
was
presumably
based
on
a
jury
finding
of
causation.
and
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
arguably
can
be
read
to
affirm
that
verdict.
we
address
ourselves
to
it
merely
to
show
that
standard's
objection
is
not
substantial
that
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could've
found
causation
and
that
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
a
question
of
such
importance
that
it
need
to
deter
this
court
from
addressing
itself
to
the
major
issue
and
to
reinstating
verdict.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
read
their
brief
and
i
think
some
of
that
doesn't
come
out
here.
i
will
be
willing
to
but
it
would
have
been
redundant.
i
think
that
the
causation
point
was
by
for
the
most
important
point
stressed
in
standard's
brief.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
i'm
not
precisely
sure
what
standard
would
like
this
court
to
do.
i
think
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
yes.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
both
perkins
and
signal
were
wholesalers
in
the
pacific
northwest.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
was
i
understand
section
2
(a)
unless
you
have
--
unless
there
are
reasons
for
discriminating
in
price
reasons
cognizable
under
the
statute
you
sell
to
all
direct
purchasers
at
the
same
price.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
there's
no
reason.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
to
that
point
mr.
justice
fortas
i
would
think
it
could
probably
be
cause
justified
or
justified
on
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
that
really
is
in
--
an
integral
part
of
our
argument
because
the
question
isn't
raised
here
both
signal
and
perkins
were
operating
on
the
same
functional
level.
they
were
both
wholesalers
in
the
pacific
northwest.
perkins
described
himself
as
a
wholesaler
and
there
was
testimony
of
an
expert
marketing
witness
as
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
perkins
sold
to
retailer
--
sold
to
independent
distributors.
it
also
sold
to
retail
stations,
some
of
the
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
there
is
no
breakdown
in
the
record
your
honor
of
the
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
no,
it
does
not
your
honor
because
the
theory
depends
upon
perkins'
function.
perkins
was
a
very
real
wholesaler,
he
operated
bulk
plants,
he
had
his
own
trucking
facilities
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
the
damages
based
--
the
damages
--
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
because
of
its
feeling
that
the
damage
is
attributable
to
regal.
we're
not
fairly
comprehended
within
the
verdict.
those
would
be
damages
at
the
retail
level.
perkins
has
damaged
computation
exhibits
however,
contained
evidence
of
the
loss
in
going
concern
value
of
this
entire
enterprise
as
well
as
evidence
as
to
all
points.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
insofar
as
--
yes,
insofar
as
this
theory
is
concerned,
yes.
that
is
what
we're
concerned
about.
we're
concerned
about
the
harm
cause,
the
retailers
serviced
by
perkins,
be
the
independent
retailers
or
be
the
retailers
operating
stations
owned
by
mr.
perkins.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
your
honor,
that
would
suppose
of
it
very
concisely.
we
do
believe
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
which
the
jury
--
from
which
the
jury
could've
found
that
that
did
happen
that
the
price
differential
did
go
down
through
the
distributive
chain.
but
in
view
of
the
integrated
nature
of
the
chain,
we
don't
believe
that
the
jury
had
to
trace
the
price
at
every
level.
but
that
question
again
is
not
necessarily
presented
because
of
the
substantial
evidence
to
support
your
honor's
formulation.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
the
difference,
there
are
some
dispute
as
to
this,
the
price
difference
is
admitted.
standard
contends
that
the
dispute
amounted
to
between
45
–
45
one-thousandths
of
a
cent
to
approximately
65
one-thousandths
of
a
cent
per
gallon.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
that's
hundreds,
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
had
that
wrong.
that's
--
it
was
approximately
half
a
cent
to
approximately
seven-tenths
of
a
cent.
we
contend
that
at
the
very
lease
a
free
factor
has
to
be
added
back
into
those
figures
which
we
paid
--
which
would
increase
them
to
approximately
eight-tenths
of
a
cent
to
a
penny.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
your
honor
it
comes
up
in
this
way,
the
portland-vancouver
area,
under
the
evidence,
is
an
integral
marketing
area.
standard's
terminal
was
in
willbridge
which
is
in
portland.
there
was
a
price
to
signal
which
lifted
at
willbridge
and
it
was
at
priced
to
perkins
which
lifted
at
willbridge.
the
perkins
--
standard,
perkins
though
had
to
transport
his
gasoline
across
the
river
because
his
stations
were
in
the
vancouver
area
within
the
same
trading
area,
within
the
same
relevant
market
but
across
the
river.
that
cost
him
approximately
three-tenths
of
a
cent
per
gallon
of
gasoline
and
standard
gave
him
an
allowance
for
that
but
standard
deducts
its
allowance
from
his
price.
we
contend
that
since
he
had
to
pay
to
freight
anyway,
there
should
be
no
deduction
from
the
price
he
paid
standard
and
therefore
the
prices
should
be
equalized
at
the
price
in
willbridge.
but
there's
an
additional
factor
on
this
as
mr.
kintner
pointed
out
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
signal
offered
perkins
during
this
period
a
price
which
ranged
from
75
one-hundredths
of
a
cent
to
eight-tenths
of
a
cent
better
than
the
price
standard
offered
perkins.
and
standard
at
that
time
was
supplying
all
of
signal's
gasoline.
now,
the
jury
could've
inferred
from
that
if
you
believe
respondent's
price
discrimination
figures
that
signal
was
selling
to
perkins
at
a
loss
and
was
willing
to
do
so.
or
the
jury
could've
believe
that
signal
was
going
to
make
a
profit
on
these
sales
which
would've
meant
that
they
would've
been
getting
a
better
price
then
either
party
have
been
able
to
demonstrate
the
upper
limit
of
it
would
not
be
able
to
be
determined
on
the
record
but
the
jury
was
certainly
not
bound
to
find
that
the
prices
are
set
forth
in
the
schedules
and
the
amounts
of
the
differentials
are
set
forth
in
the
schedules
where
the
only
prices.
beyond
this,
it's
a
very
substantial
--
it
comes
to
be
a
lot
of
money.
perkins
sold
over
20
million
gallons
of
gasoline
during
the
claim
period.
a
half
a
cent
per
gallon
would've
been
a
$100,000.00
which
should
have
made
the
substantial
difference
in
his
ability
to
remain
viable.
during
the
time,
during
this
period,
standard
was
giving
as
i
pointed
out
this
lower
price
to
signal.
standard
also
was
providing
price
assistance
to
its
branded
dealers
who
competed
with
perkins
at
retail.
now,
the
branded
dealers
were
independent
operators
of
chevron
and
signal
stations,
the
signal
stations
being
independent
of
signal
oil
and
gas
company.
they
were
purchased
from
signal
oil
and
company
by
standard
in
the
late
40's
were
operated
as
a
division
of
standard.
standard
gave
price
assistance
to
those
branded
dealers
both
in
portland
and
located
many
miles
distant
from
portland.
the
result
was
that
the
market
went
down
even
further
and
stayed
down
precisely
because
standard
was
the
price
leader
in
the
area.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
when
standard
dropped
his
prices
or
raised
its
prices
other
companies
could
not
alone
remain
at
equilibrium.
they
had
to
go
that
way
as
one
shell
dealer
testified.
it
was
the
signal
brand
the
dealer
that
he
looked
to
when
there
were
two
retailers
under
pricing
him
in
the
market.
so
this
was
a
further
depressing
effect
and
it
was
one
which
caused
the
market
to
stay
down.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
reviewed
the
facts
underlying
--
the
ninth
circuit
reviewed
the
facts
involved
in
most
of
this
situation.
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
that
regal
cause
the
price
worst,
that
those
price
were
spread
throughout
the
pacific
northwest,
and
that
perkins
had
demonstrated
that
those
price
worst
at
harm
did.
in
his
business,
it
adversely
affected
him
causing
his
ultimate
destruction.
now,
petitioner
was
harmed
in
two
ways,
he
lost
customers
and
his
sales
declined.
he
was
selling
gasoline
as
a
minor
standard
would
not
permit
him
to
testify
and
i
would
not
permit
him
to
advertise
that
he
sold
of
major
brand
gasoline.
the
accepted
major-minor
differential
was
two
cents.
at
times
during
the
period
involved
here,
mr.
perkins
was
unable
to
keep
his
price
two
cents
below
unless
he
was
willing
to
absorb
great
losses,
he
ended
up
one
cent
below
the
majors,
he
ended
up
even
with
the
brand
of
dealers
at
times.
when
he
did
that,
he
lost
sales,
when
he
maintained
the
differential
he
lost
--
when
he
maintained
the
differential
he
lost
profits
on
the
sales
he
did
make
either
way,
he
was
cut.
perkins
went
to
standard
during
the
period
and
asked
them
for
assistance.
he
said,
he
will
be
willing
to
take
assistance
at
the
wholesale
level
for
the
same
type
branded
signal
and
getting
the
same
price
or
else
he
would
appreciate
getting
some
assistance
comparable
to
that
being
received
by
the
branded
dealers
at
the
retail
level.
standard
not
only
declined
to
give
him
the
assistance,
they
denied
that
they
have
been
giving
price
assistance
to
the
branded
dealers
or
that
they
had
been
discriminating
him
price
in
favor
of
signal.
as
a
result,
perkins
received
no
help
and
he
went
out
of
business.
now,
there
was
evidence
before
the
jury
and
this
is
the
evidence
i
referred
to
before
is
the
evidence
of
passing
on.
there
was
evidence
before
the
jury
that
signal
wanted
a
lower
price
from
standard
precisely
so
that
he
could
give
that
lower
price
to
its
customers.
the
price
didn't
just
happen,
it
was
negotiated
and
it
was
negotiated
at
the
behest
of
signal.
signal
had
standard
in
somewhat
of
a
box
because
standard
was
dependent
on
signal's
crude
oil
to
run
its
refineries.
so
signal
kept
insisting
on
a
better
price.
during
those
negotiations,
the
signal
negotiator
who
was
there
marketing
vice
president
pointed
out
that
and
he
took
the
position
that
unless
he
had
a
lower
price,
he
couldn't
pass
it
on.
after
he
got
the
lower
price
and
after
regal
entered
the
portland
area
two
standard
executives
acknowledge
that
regal
had
a
better
price
than
perkins
in
the
pacific
northwest.
and
they
predicted
that
unless
standard
did
something
to
alleviate
the
situation,
regal
would
wreck
that
market
and
they
were
right.
standard
also
knew
of
perkins'
position,
perkins
had
told
him
and
unless
they
held
him
not
only
was
the
market
going
to
be
wrecked
but
he
was
going
to
be
driven
out
of
business
as
he
pointed
he
told
them
that
he
couldn't
live
under
the
existing
arrangement
and
that
too
turned
out
to
be
true.
he
went
out
of
business.
it
is
our
feeling
that
this
--
there
was
substantial
evidence
before
the
jury
on
which
the
jury
could've
based
the
finding
that
it
was
the
price
discrimination
in
favor
of
signal
supported
by
the
price
assistance
to
the
branded
dealers
which
approximately
cost
perkins'
destruction
that
the
jury
in
short
could've
inferred
the
same
causal
connection
which
standard
executives
have
predicted.
the
remaining
issue
was
one
of
damages.
the
evidence
that
i
have
discussed
on
causation
proves
the
requirement
of
legal
harm,
perkins
was
injured,
he
went
out
of
business,
he
lost
sales
and
he
lost
profits.
and
there
was
substantial
evidence
before
the
jury
from
which
the
jury
could've
inferred
the
amount
by
which
he
was
injured
which
is
the
remaining
requirement
that
he
must
meet.
his
evidence
of
damage
included
his
business
records
for
the
entire
claim
period,
his
purchase
invoices
for
the
claim
period,
his
sales
invoices
with
of
his
lost
customers
mainly
distributors,
it
contain
evidence
of
his
declined
in
gallonage.
it
contained
evidence
that
he
could've
increased
the
sales
above
what
he
was
selling
during
the
claim
period
without
any
additional
cost.
the
record
contained
evidence
of
the
amount
of
gross
profit
perkins
was
making
during
the
claim
period.
contained
evidence
of
his
expenses.
it
also
contained
evidence
of
the
minimal
gross
profit
necessary
to
survive
as
an
independent
jobber
in
the
pacific
northwest.
it
contained
evidence
of
the
amount
of
the
price
differential
and
it
contained
the
formula
by
which
the
jury
could
ascertain
the
going
concern
value
of
perkins'
operation
where
they
defined
that
it
had
to
go
in
concerned
value.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
rule
that
there
was
not
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
jury
verdict
or
left
their
--
the
amount
of
the
award
was
unreasonable.
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
contrary
to
perkins
on
one
damage
item.
it
held
that
there
had
been
evidence
improperly
admitted
as
evidence
of
damages
and
that
this
evidence
was
evidence
of
brokerage
commissions
which
perkins
had
not
been
paid
by
these
corporations
for
getting
them
gasoline,
an
evidence
of
loss
rentals
from
retail
stations.
now,
a
little
bit
of
history
is
necessary
to
explain
that.
this
was
a
lawsuit
brought
on
behalf
of
perkins
as
an
individual
and
two
corporations
which
he
had
formed
to
run
his
business
in
the
50's.
the
evidence
demonstrates
the
standard
never
recognized
the
corporations
and
they
dealt
with
perkins
independently.
but
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
standard
insisted
that
the
corporations
bring
the
suit
and
there
were
assignments
in
the
corporation
suit
in
addition
to
mr.
perkins.
in
that
context,
mr.
perkins
has
been
trying
to
prove
that
he
had
standing
to
sue
as
an
individual
and
that
he
had
suffered
legal
harm
introduced
evidence
of
these
items
of
--
these
items
of
proof,
the
brokerage
and
the
lost
rentals.
he
introduced
them
to
prove
that
he
had
standing.
that
issue
wasn't
in
the
case
anymore
because
the
district
judge
charged
the
jury
that
mr.
perkins
was
a
purchaser
from
standard
and
that
is
not
contested
but
that
is
how
it
came
in.
our
answer
to
that
point
is
that
the
evidence
was
not
introduced,
this
evidence
have
damages
that
it
was
introduced
as
evidence
of
legal
injury
and
that
in
any
event
it
could
not
have
misled
the
jury
because
it
was
not
included
in
perkins'
damage
computation
exhibits
nor
was
it
included
in
the
judge's
detail
charge
on
damages
as
one
of
the
items
which
the
jury
might
properly
consider.
and
just
one
final
point,
it
is
important,
i
think,
that
standard
argued
this
point
at
great
length
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
point
at
which
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
at
first
in
perkins
are
damage
question.
but
they
don't
say
a
word
in
defense
of
it
here.
here,
they
take
a
different
attack
and
they
suggest
that
there
are
many
other
errors
which
preclude
reinstatement
of
the
verdict.
we
discussed
those
in
our
reply
brief
but
it
is
our
position
that
none
of
those
errors,
the
errors
which
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
see
fit
to
discuss
are
of
any
greater
substance
than
the
errors
discussed
in
the
reply
brief
and
indeed,
that
our
reading
of
the
brief
fails
to
disclose
any
significant
differences
between
the
issues
raised
in
the
brief
and
the
issues
in
the
specifications
of
errors
more
elaborate
but
essentially
the
same
questions.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
myself
to
the
questions
of
causation
and
damages.
the
first
question
is
causation
and
the
issue
there
is
simply
whether
there
was
enough
evidence
before
the
jury
from
which
it
could
reasonably
infer
that
perkins'
destruction
is
an
independent
marketer
of
gasoline
was
approximately
caused
by
the
price
discrimination
in
favor
of
signal
oil
and
gas
company.
now,
in
the
context
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
its
reversal,
the
causation
period
in
question
which
is
important
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
is
a
period
from
september
of
1956
through
december
of
1957
and
it
involves
in
the
beginning
the
portland
area
in
oregon.
the
parties
the
most
important
parties
for
signal
which
was
purchasing
gasoline
from
standard
and
regal
stations
company
which
was
marketing
the
gasoline
in
the
portland
area.
western
hyway
which
was
repurchasing
from
signal
was
trucking
the
gasoline
to
and
from
that
the
willbridge
terminal
to
the
retail
outlets.
now,
the
period
as
i
pointed
out
is
september
1956
through
december
1957.
immediately
prior
to
that
time,
none
of
the
members
of
signal's
corporate
family
were
in
the
portland
area.
signal
was
lifting
no
gasoline
from
standard's
wilbert's
terminal.
western
hyway
was
trucking
no
gasoline
and
there
were
no
regal
retail
outlets
in
portland.
in
late
august,
signal
began
its
first
lifting
at
willbridge.
regal
opened
its
first
station
in
portland
in
september
and
western
at
that
time
began
to
track
the
gasoline.
throughout
the
period,
there
was
an
admitted
discrimination
in
price
in
favor
of
signal
oil
and
gas
by
standard.
it
wasn't
always
admitted
or
in
fact
it
was
hardly
contested
prior
to
the
deposition
of
signal's
president
but
the
day
before
that
standard
admitted
the
discrimination
and
it's
an
admitted
fact
before
this
court.
so,
the
price
of
gasoline
was
always
lowered
going
into
the
signal
chain
of
distribution
at
wholesale
and
it
always
came
out
lower.
regal
consistently
underpriced
perkins
in
the
market
throughout
the
period.
indeed,
when
regal
first
opened
its
station,
it
dropped
retail
prices
by
four
cents.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
we
have
said
that
it
was
essential
to
prove
both,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
did
not
encompass
as
a
matter
of
law
the
activities
of
regal.
therefore,
the
regal
damage
is
caused
by
regal
could
not
become
a
part
of
the
verdict.
we
argue
that
the
statute
does
encompass
the
activities
of
regal.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
we
are
saying
that,
we
have
an
argument
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
that
is
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
that's
correct.
standard
has
contested
the
causation
on
the
--
is
contested
that
the
price
discrimination
to
signal
cause
perkins'
harm
at
the
retail
level
and
if
therefore
there
was
no
way
which
perkins
could've
been
injured
a
as
a
retailer
and
there
was
no
way
which
he
could've
been
injured
as
a
wholesaler
because
his
harm
as
a
wholesaler
was
derivative
harm
in
a
sense
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
his
retailers
were
getting
beat.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
no,
no.
the
ninth
circuit,
mr.
justice
white
--
as
i
read
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
they
decided
that
it
is
a
straight
question
of
law.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
we
addressed
ourselves
to
this
question
principally
because
it
is
the
overriding
question
in
standard's
brief.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
we
think
you
should
decide
the
causation
question.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
it
is
arguable
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
decide
it.
the
ninth
circuit
has
a
passage
in
a
footnote
6
of
its
opinion
where
it
says
even
granting
that
there
was
a
price
discrimination
in
favor
of
signal
and
even
granting
that
it
was
passed
on
to
regal,
we
hold
that
it's
not
actionable
and
they
went
on
to
give
some
reason.
that
can
be
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
the
reason
why
we
think
it's
arguable
that
that
was
a
holding
on
causation
was
there
was
no
question.
there
was
no
need
for
an
aguendo
on
the
question
of
the
discrimination
that
was
admitted.
so,
you
can
fairly
read
that
passage
as
a
holding
by
the
ninth
circuit
that
there
was
causation.
in
any
event,
the
jury
verdict
was
presumably
based
on
a
jury
finding
of
causation.
and
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
arguably
can
be
read
to
affirm
that
verdict.
we
address
ourselves
to
it
merely
to
show
that
standard's
objection
is
not
substantial
that
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could've
found
causation
and
that
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
a
question
of
such
importance
that
it
need
to
deter
this
court
from
addressing
itself
to
the
major
issue
and
to
reinstating
verdict.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
read
their
brief
and
i
think
some
of
that
doesn't
come
out
here.
i
will
be
willing
to
but
it
would
have
been
redundant.
i
think
that
the
causation
point
was
by
for
the
most
important
point
stressed
in
standard's
brief.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
i'm
not
precisely
sure
what
standard
would
like
this
court
to
do.
i
think
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
yes.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
both
perkins
and
signal
were
wholesalers
in
the
pacific
northwest.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
was
i
understand
section
2
(a)
unless
you
have
--
unless
there
are
reasons
for
discriminating
in
price
reasons
cognizable
under
the
statute
you
sell
to
all
direct
purchasers
at
the
same
price.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
there's
no
reason.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
to
that
point
mr.
justice
fortas
i
would
think
it
could
probably
be
cause
justified
or
justified
on
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
that
really
is
in
--
an
integral
part
of
our
argument
because
the
question
isn't
raised
here
both
signal
and
perkins
were
operating
on
the
same
functional
level.
they
were
both
wholesalers
in
the
pacific
northwest.
perkins
described
himself
as
a
wholesaler
and
there
was
testimony
of
an
expert
marketing
witness
as
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
perkins
sold
to
retailer
--
sold
to
independent
distributors.
it
also
sold
to
retail
stations,
some
of
the
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
there
is
no
breakdown
in
the
record
your
honor
of
the
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
no,
it
does
not
your
honor
because
the
theory
depends
upon
perkins'
function.
perkins
was
a
very
real
wholesaler,
he
operated
bulk
plants,
he
had
his
own
trucking
facilities
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
the
damages
based
--
the
damages
--
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
because
of
its
feeling
that
the
damage
is
attributable
to
regal.
we're
not
fairly
comprehended
within
the
verdict.
those
would
be
damages
at
the
retail
level.
perkins
has
damaged
computation
exhibits
however,
contained
evidence
of
the
loss
in
going
concern
value
of
this
entire
enterprise
as
well
as
evidence
as
to
all
points.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
insofar
as
--
yes,
insofar
as
this
theory
is
concerned,
yes.
that
is
what
we're
concerned
about.
we're
concerned
about
the
harm
cause,
the
retailers
serviced
by
perkins,
be
the
independent
retailers
or
be
the
retailers
operating
stations
owned
by
mr.
perkins.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
your
honor,
that
would
suppose
of
it
very
concisely.
we
do
believe
that
there
was
substantial
evidence
which
the
jury
--
from
which
the
jury
could've
found
that
that
did
happen
that
the
price
differential
did
go
down
through
the
distributive
chain.
but
in
view
of
the
integrated
nature
of
the
chain,
we
don't
believe
that
the
jury
had
to
trace
the
price
at
every
level.
but
that
question
again
is
not
necessarily
presented
because
of
the
substantial
evidence
to
support
your
honor's
formulation.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
--
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
the
difference,
there
are
some
dispute
as
to
this,
the
price
difference
is
admitted.
standard
contends
that
the
dispute
amounted
to
between
45
–
45
one-thousandths
of
a
cent
to
approximately
65
one-thousandths
of
a
cent
per
gallon.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
that's
hundreds,
i'm
sorry
your
honor
i
had
that
wrong.
that's
--
it
was
approximately
half
a
cent
to
approximately
seven-tenths
of
a
cent.
we
contend
that
at
the
very
lease
a
free
factor
has
to
be
added
back
into
those
figures
which
we
paid
--
which
would
increase
them
to
approximately
eight-tenths
of
a
cent
to
a
penny.
mr.
george
r.
kucik
well,
your
honor
it
comes
up
in
this
way,
the
portland-vancouver
area,
under
the
evidence,
is
an
integral
marketing
area.
standard's
terminal
was
in
willbridge
which
is
in
portland.
there
was
a
price
to
signal
which
lifted
at
willbridge
and
it
was
at
priced
to
perkins
which
lifted
at
willbridge.
the
perkins
--
standard,
perkins
though
had
to
transport
his
gasoline
across
the
river
because
his
stations
were
in
the
vancouver
area
within
the
same
trading
area,
within
the
same
relevant
market
but
across
the
river.
that
cost
him
approximately
three-tenths
of
a
cent
per
gallon
of
gasoline
and
standard
gave
him
an
allowance
for
that
but
standard
deducts
its
allowance
from
his
price.
we
contend
that
since
he
had
to
pay
to
freight
anyway,
there
should
be
no
deduction
from
the
price
he
paid
standard
and
therefore
the
prices
should
be
equalized
at
the
price
in
willbridge.
but
there's
an
additional
factor
on
this
as
mr.
kintner
pointed
out
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
that
signal
offered
perkins
during
this
period
a
price
which
ranged
from
75
one-hundredths
of
a
cent
to
eight-tenths
of
a
cent
better
than
the
price
standard
offered
perkins.
and
standard
at
that
time
was
supplying
all
of
signal's
gasoline.
now,
the
jury
could've
inferred
from
that
if
you
believe
respondent's
price
discrimination
figures
that
signal
was
selling
to
perkins
at
a
loss
and
was
willing
to
do
so.
or
the
jury
could've
believe
that
signal
was
going
to
make
a
profit
on
these
sales
which
would've
meant
that
they
would've
been
getting
a
better
price
then
either
party
have
been
able
to
demonstrate
the
upper
limit
of
it
would
not
be
able
to
be
determined
on
the
record
but
the
jury
was
certainly
not
bound
to
find
that
the
prices
are
set
forth
in
the
schedules
and
the
amounts
of
the
differentials
are
set
forth
in
the
schedules
where
the
only
prices.
beyond
this,
it's
a
very
substantial
--
it
comes
to
be
a
lot
of
money.
perkins
sold
over
20
million
gallons
of
gasoline
during
the
claim
period.
a
half
a
cent
per
gallon
would've
been
a
$100,000.00
which
should
have
made
the
substantial
difference
in
his
ability
to
remain
viable.
during
the
time,
during
this
period,
standard
was
giving
as
i
pointed
out
this
lower
price
to
signal.
standard
also
was
providing
price
assistance
to
its
branded
dealers
who
competed
with
perkins
at
retail.
now,
the
branded
dealers
were
independent
operators
of
chevron
and
signal
stations,
the
signal
stations
being
independent
of
signal
oil
and
gas
company.
they
were
purchased
from
signal
oil
and
company
by
standard
in
the
late
40's
were
operated
as
a
division
of
standard.
standard
gave
price
assistance
to
those
branded
dealers
both
in
portland
and
located
many
miles
distant
from
portland.
the
result
was
that
the
market
went
down
even
further
and
stayed
down
precisely
because
standard
was
the
price
leader
in
the
area.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
when
standard
dropped
his
prices
or
raised
its
prices
other
companies
could
not
alone
remain
at
equilibrium.
they
had
to
go
that
way
as
one
shell
dealer
testified.
it
was
the
signal
brand
the
dealer
that
he
looked
to
when
there
were
two
retailers
under
pricing
him
in
the
market.
so
this
was
a
further
depressing
effect
and
it
was
one
which
caused
the
market
to
stay
down.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
reviewed
the
facts
underlying
--
the
ninth
circuit
reviewed
the
facts
involved
in
most
of
this
situation.
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out
there
was
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
that
regal
cause
the
price
worst,
that
those
price
were
spread
throughout
the
pacific
northwest,
and
that
perkins
had
demonstrated
that
those
price
worst
at
harm
did.
in
his
business,
it
adversely
affected
him
causing
his
ultimate
destruction.
now,
petitioner
was
harmed
in
two
ways,
he
lost
customers
and
his
sales
declined.
he
was
selling
gasoline
as
a
minor
standard
would
not
permit
him
to
testify
and
i
would
not
permit
him
to
advertise
that
he
sold
of
major
brand
gasoline.
the
accepted
major-minor
differential
was
two
cents.
at
times
during
the
period
involved
here,
mr.
perkins
was
unable
to
keep
his
price
two
cents
below
unless
he
was
willing
to
absorb
great
losses,
he
ended
up
one
cent
below
the
majors,
he
ended
up
even
with
the
brand
of
dealers
at
times.
when
he
did
that,
he
lost
sales,
when
he
maintained
the
differential
he
lost
--
when
he
maintained
the
differential
he
lost
profits
on
the
sales
he
did
make
either
way,
he
was
cut.
perkins
went
to
standard
during
the
period
and
asked
them
for
assistance.
he
said,
he
will
be
willing
to
take
assistance
at
the
wholesale
level
for
the
same
type
branded
signal
and
getting
the
same
price
or
else
he
would
appreciate
getting
some
assistance
comparable
to
that
being
received
by
the
branded
dealers
at
the
retail
level.
standard
not
only
declined
to
give
him
the
assistance,
they
denied
that
they
have
been
giving
price
assistance
to
the
branded
dealers
or
that
they
had
been
discriminating
him
price
in
favor
of
signal.
as
a
result,
perkins
received
no
help
and
he
went
out
of
business.
now,
there
was
evidence
before
the
jury
and
this
is
the
evidence
i
referred
to
before
is
the
evidence
of
passing
on.
there
was
evidence
before
the
jury
that
signal
wanted
a
lower
price
from
standard
precisely
so
that
he
could
give
that
lower
price
to
its
customers.
the
price
didn't
just
happen,
it
was
negotiated
and
it
was
negotiated
at
the
behest
of
signal.
signal
had
standard
in
somewhat
of
a
box
because
standard
was
dependent
on
signal's
crude
oil
to
run
its
refineries.
so
signal
kept
insisting
on
a
better
price.
during
those
negotiations,
the
signal
negotiator
who
was
there
marketing
vice
president
pointed
out
that
and
he
took
the
position
that
unless
he
had
a
lower
price,
he
couldn't
pass
it
on.
after
he
got
the
lower
price
and
after
regal
entered
the
portland
area
two
standard
executives
acknowledge
that
regal
had
a
better
price
than
perkins
in
the
pacific
northwest.
and
they
predicted
that
unless
standard
did
something
to
alleviate
the
situation,
regal
would
wreck
that
market
and
they
were
right.
standard
also
knew
of
perkins'
position,
perkins
had
told
him
and
unless
they
held
him
not
only
was
the
market
going
to
be
wrecked
but
he
was
going
to
be
driven
out
of
business
as
he
pointed
he
told
them
that
he
couldn't
live
under
the
existing
arrangement
and
that
too
turned
out
to
be
true.
he
went
out
of
business.
it
is
our
feeling
that
this
--
there
was
substantial
evidence
before
the
jury
on
which
the
jury
could've
based
the
finding
that
it
was
the
price
discrimination
in
favor
of
signal
supported
by
the
price
assistance
to
the
branded
dealers
which
approximately
cost
perkins'
destruction
that
the
jury
in
short
could've
inferred
the
same
causal
connection
which
standard
executives
have
predicted.
the
remaining
issue
was
one
of
damages.
the
evidence
that
i
have
discussed
on
causation
proves
the
requirement
of
legal
harm,
perkins
was
injured,
he
went
out
of
business,
he
lost
sales
and
he
lost
profits.
and
there
was
substantial
evidence
before
the
jury
from
which
the
jury
could've
inferred
the
amount
by
which
he
was
injured
which
is
the
remaining
requirement
that
he
must
meet.
his
evidence
of
damage
included
his
business
records
for
the
entire
claim
period,
his
purchase
invoices
for
the
claim
period,
his
sales
invoices
with
of
his
lost
customers
mainly
distributors,
it
contain
evidence
of
his
declined
in
gallonage.
it
contained
evidence
that
he
could've
increased
the
sales
above
what
he
was
selling
during
the
claim
period
without
any
additional
cost.
the
record
contained
evidence
of
the
amount
of
gross
profit
perkins
was
making
during
the
claim
period.
contained
evidence
of
his
expenses.
it
also
contained
evidence
of
the
minimal
gross
profit
necessary
to
survive
as
an
independent
jobber
in
the
pacific
northwest.
it
contained
evidence
of
the
amount
of
the
price
differential
and
it
contained
the
formula
by
which
the
jury
could
ascertain
the
going
concern
value
of
perkins'
operation
where
they
defined
that
it
had
to
go
in
concerned
value.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
rule
that
there
was
not
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
jury
verdict
or
left
their
--
the
amount
of
the
award
was
unreasonable.
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
contrary
to
perkins
on
one
damage
item.
it
held
that
there
had
been
evidence
improperly
admitted
as
evidence
of
damages
and
that
this
evidence
was
evidence
of
brokerage
commissions
which
perkins
had
not
been
paid
by
these
corporations
for
getting
them
gasoline,
an
evidence
of
loss
rentals
from
retail
stations.
now,
a
little
bit
of
history
is
necessary
to
explain
that.
this
was
a
lawsuit
brought
on
behalf
of
perkins
as
an
individual
and
two
corporations
which
he
had
formed
to
run
his
business
in
the
50's.
the
evidence
demonstrates
the
standard
never
recognized
the
corporations
and
they
dealt
with
perkins
independently.
but
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
standard
insisted
that
the
corporations
bring
the
suit
and
there
were
assignments
in
the
corporation
suit
in
addition
to
mr.
perkins.
in
that
context,
mr.
perkins
has
been
trying
to
prove
that
he
had
standing
to
sue
as
an
individual
and
that
he
had
suffered
legal
harm
introduced
evidence
of
these
items
of
--
these
items
of
proof,
the
brokerage
and
the
lost
rentals.
he
introduced
them
to
prove
that
he
had
standing.
that
issue
wasn't
in
the
case
anymore
because
the
district
judge
charged
the
jury
that
mr.
perkins
was
a
purchaser
from
standard
and
that
is
not
contested
but
that
is
how
it
came
in.
our
answer
to
that
point
is
that
the
evidence
was
not
introduced,
this
evidence
have
damages
that
it
was
introduced
as
evidence
of
legal
injury
and
that
in
any
event
it
could
not
have
misled
the
jury
because
it
was
not
included
in
perkins'
damage
computation
exhibits
nor
was
it
included
in
the
judge's
detail
charge
on
damages
as
one
of
the
items
which
the
jury
might
properly
consider.
and
just
one
final
point,
it
is
important,
i
think,
that
standard
argued
this
point
at
great
length
of
the
ninth
circuit,
the
point
at
which
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
at
first
in
perkins
are
damage
question.
but
they
don't
say
a
word
in
defense
of
it
here.
here,
they
take
a
different
attack
and
they
suggest
that
there
are
many
other
errors
which
preclude
reinstatement
of
the
verdict.
we
discussed
those
in
our
reply
brief
but
it
is
our
position
that
none
of
those
errors,
the
errors
which
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
see
fit
to
discuss
are
of
any
greater
substance
than
the
errors
discussed
in
the
reply
brief
and
indeed,
that
our
reading
of
the
brief
fails
to
disclose
any
significant
differences
between
the
issues
raised
in
the
brief
and
the
issues
in
the
specifications
of
errors
more
elaborate
but
essentially
the
same
questions.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
