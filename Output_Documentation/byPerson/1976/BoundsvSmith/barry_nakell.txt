mr.
barry
nakell
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
younger
against
gilmore
was
decided
unanimously
by
this
court.
the
decision
was
rendered
after
mature
and
thorough
consideration
and
it
was
based
on
sound
principles.
mr.
barry
nakell
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
had
made
that
same
mistake
originally
in
my
brief
and
opposition’s
petition
for
certiorari,
i
made
the
same
mistake.
i
later
learned
that
complete
briefs
were
filed
in
the
case
and
indeed
that
oral
argument
was
held
and
actually
the
opinion
indicates
having
heard
the
case
on
its
merits.
mr.
barry
nakell
yes,
your
honor.
the
briefs
show
and
the
transcript
to
the
oral
argument
shows
that
the
issues
in
that
case
were
carefully
and
thoroughly
canvassed
by
the
parties.
mr.
barry
nakell
that
is
that
correct
your
honor
certainly
and
i
think
that
the
younger
v.
gilmore
case
stands
as
a
very
substantial
precedent
for
this
court
as
well
because
it
was
decided
not
summarily
but
after
complete
a
briefing
and
argument,
and
indeed
california
in
its
jurisdictional
statement
and
its
brief
presented
all
of
the
arguments
that
north
carolina
has
presented
in
this
case
with
the
exception
of
the
argument
based
upon
ross
v.
moffitt.
mr.
barry
nakell
the
question
was,
as
stated
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
filed
by
california
the
question
was
whether
the
state
of
california
has
a
constitutional
obligation
to
provide
extensive
law
libraries
for
its
inmates.
mr.
barry
nakell
that
was
the
statement
of
the
question
in
the
jurisdiction
statement.
mr.
barry
nakell
i
am
sorry.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
was
then
the
alternative
and
that
is
the
view
that
we
take
of
the
issue
in
this
case
that
the
ruling
in
younger
v.
gilmore
the
holding
in
younger
v.
gilmore
permits,
requires
the
state
to
provide
either
law
libraries
or
a
reasonable
alternative
in
the
form
of
legal
services
through
lawyers
or
other
professionals.
mr.
barry
nakell
not
necessarily
your
honor.
mr.
barry
nakell
if
there
were
reasonably
confident
fellow
prisoners,
i
would
think
your
honor
that
the
reasonably
confident
fellow
prisoners
would
also
need
law
books.
in
order
to
be
able
to
function
in
that
role
the
law
books
would
still
be
necessary.
mr.
barry
nakell
they
may
or
may
not,
they
may
--
as
i
understood
mr.
safron
to
say
that
some
prisoners
bring
law
books
to
--
mr.
barry
nakell
neither,
they
are
assuring
that
they
do
or
what
the
extent
of
their
books
is.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
your
honor,
the
state
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
has
provided
an
alternative.
we
proved
in
the
district
court
that
there
were
no
law
books.
the
record
shows
that
there
were
no
law
books
in
any
of
the
prisons.
that
is
what
the
record
shows.
the
state
did
not
--
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
the
record
says
no
law
books;
it
does
not
make
a
distinction.
there
are
no
facts
in
the
record
to
show
that
there
are
any
law
books
or
what
the
extent
of
them
is
provided
by
any
person
other
than
the
state,
including
inmates.
i
would
grant
that
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
some
inmates
have
some
law
books,
but
i
certainly
do
not
--
mr.
barry
nakell
i
believe
that
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
this
court
--
mr.
barry
nakell
but
it
may
well
be
your
honor;
it
may
well
be.
i
think
it
would
still
depend
upon
question
such
as
what
if
the
writ
writers
released
or
parole
the
next
day
then
that
eliminates
the
problem.
mr.
barry
nakell
if
that
writ
writer
would
measure
up
to
the
standard
set
by
this
court
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
where
the
court
--
mr.
barry
nakell
with
johnson
v.
avery
--
undoubtedly
the
facts
of
johnson
v.
avery
were
relatively
narrow.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
state
could
not
prohibit
the
operation
of
writ
writers
unless
it
provided
some
adequate
alternative.
in
defining
what
an
adequate
alternative
might
be
in
the
suggestions
of
the
majority
made
in
--
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
in
so
far
as
the
prohibition
of
writ
writers
is
concerned,
i
would
quite
agree
that
paralegals
including
inmate
paralegals
might
satisfy
the
requirements
even
of
younger
v.
gilmore,
not
alone
of
johnson
v.
avery,
but
there
is
no
showing
on
this
record
that
there
is
any
such
alternative
available
in
the
north
carolina
prison
system.
mr.
barry
nakell
i
agree
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
that
was
what
was
involved
in
johnson
v.
avery
and
the
court
held
on
the
narrow
facts
of
that
case
that
it
was
illegal
for
the
state,
i
believe
it
was
tennessee
in
that
case,
to
prohibit
writ
writers
without
providing
alternative.
i
point
out
that
the
possible
alternatives
that
the
court
suggested
that
the
state
might
implement
in
order
if
it
wanted
to
cut
out
its
writ
writer
system
did
not
include
providing
law
books.
simply
providing
law
books
was
not
one
of
the
alternatives
but
providing
paralegals
or
lawyers
--
mr.
barry
nakell
your
honor,
i
think
there
will.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
--
mr.
barry
nakell
no
your
honor,
no.
mr.
barry
nakell
well
we
do,
because
we
do
not
from
the
specific
holding
in
johnson
against
avery.
younger
against
gilmore
went
a
step
beyond
johnson
v.
avery
in
terms
its
specific
holding.
mr.
barry
nakell
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that
was
appropriate
because
underlying
the
majority
opinion
in
johnson
v.
avery
was
the
statement
that
a
prisoner
has
a
constitutional
right
to
help
in
regard
to
his
access
to
the
courts.
the
majority
said
this
and
mr.
justice
white
in
his
separate
opinion
in
dissent,
elaborated
even
further
on
that
and
expressly
said
that
without
some
help,
the
prisoner
is
affectively
barred
from
access
to
the
courts.
on
that
rationale,
which
was
the
rationale
that
supported
the
opinion
in
johnson
v.
avery,
i
think
the
court
in
and
younger
v.
gilmore
was
entitled
to
rely.
mr.
barry
nakell
as
soon
as
a
post
conviction
procedure
gets
under
way.
no,
i
did
not
understand
he
described
it
that
way
either
--
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
frankly
mr.
chief
justice,
i
must
say
that
i
have
no
independent
knowledge
of
whether
a
prisoner
who
is
denied
the
right
to
proceed
with
a
post
conviction
proceeding
and
he
was
denied
counsel
for
that
proceeding
would
be
provided
counsel
on
appeal.
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
do
know
that
the
plan
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
submitted
to
leaa
assumed,
at
page
3
(a)
of
my
brief,
assumed
that
in
order
to
get
counsel
a
prisoner
would
have
to
submit
a
petition
which
on
its
face
has
some
merit.
and
also
the
judge
larkin
who
is
probably
more
familiar
than
i
in
the
district
court
with
this
procedure
also
said
that
like
the
federal
courts
there
is
not
right
to
counsel
in
the
state
post
conviction
proceedings
unless
counsel
is
appointed.
i
quite
agreed
that
the
statute
seems
to
provide
for
it,
but
i
understand
mr.
safron
agreed
that
it
is
not
done
at
the
trial
level
where
the
statute
seems
to
provide
for,
and
quite
frankly
i
do
not
considered
myself
qualified
to
speak
as
to
whether
it
has
done
on
appeal.
i
had
always
assumed
that
it
was
not
and
they
do
not
look
to
see
whether
there
is
anything
to
the
contrary.
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
but
it
is
clear
that
the
inmate
receives
no
help
in
the
preparation
of
his
petition
at
the
initial
stage
and
he
certainly
receives
no
help
at
any
point
through
the
petition
unless
the
court
decides
to
appoint
counsel
to
represent
him.
let
me
say
that
this
petition
for
certiorari
is
just
what
it
sounds
like.
there
is
no
right
to
appeal
from
the
denial
of
post
conviction
writ
in
north
carolina.
it
is
a
discretionary
review,
and
therefore
even
if
the
application
had
some
merit
the
court
may
deny
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
intrinsic
merit.
mr.
barry
nakell
the
intermediate
court
of
appeal,
not
as
far
as
you
can
go,
you
cannot
go
any
higher
than
that
on
a
post
conviction
proceeding.
mr.
barry
nakell
i
am
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
they
sit
in
panel,
so
i
assume
that
it
could
be
done
by
a
majority
of
panel,
but
i
am
quite
frankly
not
certain
--
mr.
barry
nakell
no
not
as
far
as
i
know
your
honor,
not
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
barry
nakell
it
is
clear
mr.
justice
stevens
that
california
did
not.
in
footnote
1
of
its
opinion
of
three-judge
court
it
stated
that
california
did
not
prohibit
writ
writers,
and
therefore
i
think
on
the
facts
younger
v.
gilmore
is
precisely
the
same
as
this
case.
mr.
barry
nakell
the
district
court
actually
--
mr.
barry
nakell
well
the
district
court
ordered
--
that
is
correct
your
honor
that
is
correct
that
they
did
not
consider
writ
writers,
follow
inmates
to
be
enough.
in
the
circumstance
of
that
case
where
there
was
no
evidence
that
should
be
taken
into
account
that
as
in
this
case
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
writ
writers
were
adequate.
now,
i
might
point
out
mr.
justice
white
in
regard
to
your
interest
about
the
use
of
inmate
writ
writers
that
the
plan
submitted
by
the
state
and
approved
by
the
district
court
which
is
the
part
of
the
order
in
this
case
thus
provide
for
the
training
and
use
of
inmate
paralegal
assistance.
i
believe
the
plan
provides
for
the
training
and
use
of
about
21
of
them.
in
this
way
the
state
would
have
a
way
of
guaranteeing
or
assuring
that
there
are
writ
writers
available
on
the
premises
who
would
be
in
a
position
to
assist
the
prisoners,
and
of
course,
the
plan
is
very
carefully
drawn
to
take
account
of
the
nature
of
the
north
carolina
prison
system
far-flung
nature
of
it,
so
that
it
provides
that
only
libraries
have
to
provided
to
only
seven
of
the
prisons.
the
plan
itself
calls
for
additional
five
core
libraries.
it
also
provides
for
a
xerox
machines
to
be
available
at
the
raleigh
library
which
would
probably
be
a
central
prison.
mr.
barry
nakell
submitted
by
the
state,
that
is
correct
your
honor,
and
quite
frankly
we
found
as
to
those
aspects
of
it
that
it
was
acceptable
and
we
did
not
ask
to
have
a
law
library
in
every
one
of
the
80
or
so
prison
units.
we
were
perfectly
amenable
to
the
reasonable
compromise
in
terms
of
the
numbers
of
libraries.
i
might
say
that
this
is
far
less
than
many
professional
correctional
administrators
have
recommended.
it
is
far
less
than
the
national
advisory
commission
recommended.
mr.
barry
nakell
i
agree
with
that
your
honor.
to
the
extent
that
we
are
concerned
with
the
exercise
of
discretion
or
the
exercise
of
the
expertise
by
the
prison
administrators,
it
is
helpful
i
think
to
look
at
what
other
prison
administrators
have
thought.
mr.
barry
nakell
because
mr.
chief
justice,
the
state
of
north
carolina
in
its
plan
has
made
provision
for
being
able
to
assure
that
all
inmates
have
equal
access
to
the
library
facilities
of
the
seven
prisons.
there
are
alternative
methods
prisoners
may
be
brought
into
the
present
facility
to
have
libraries
if
they
request
to
use
the
library
and
may
be
house
there
overnight
if
necessary
according
to
the
plan.
moreover,
there
is
provision
for
a
xerox
machine
to
be
maintained
at
the
central
prison,
the
library
in
raleigh,
wherever
that
is
ultimately
situated,
so
that
any
prisoner
upon
request
could
get
copies
of
specific
cases
if
were
possible
to
serve
his
needs
without
providing
him
the
use
of
the
entire
library.
so
that,
i
believe
that
is
very
possible
with
the
seven
main
libraries
and
five
core
libraries
and
the
xerox
machine
that
this
can
be
implemented
in
such
a
way
that
all
prisoners
at
all
institutions
will
have
equal
access
to
the
library
facilities
and
will
have
meaningful
access
to
legal
materials
to
assist
them
in
their
constitutional
right
to
access
to
the
court.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
your
honor
i
believe
it
based
--
and
the
right
is
not
as
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out,
not
strictly
for
law
libraries
but
the
right
is
for
some
help
from
the
prison
--
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
your
honor
in
different
occasion
of
this
court
has
identified
it
as
ensuing
from
first
amendment
right
to
petition
for
readdress
grievances,
the
due
process
clause
--
mr.
barry
nakell
johnson
v.
avery.
i
believe
that
there
have
been
other
authority
which
have
discussed
it
as
well.
i
think
the
one
where
this
court
has
talked
about,
the
one
basis,
constitutional
basis
for
this
court,
has
talked
about
most
recently
in
procunier
v.
martinez
this
court
identified
the
due
process
clause
as
the
source
of
it.
also,
of
course,
in
younger
v.
gilmore
both
the
due
process
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
were
cited
as
the
constitutional
source
for
the
constitutional
right
of
prisoners
to
access
to
the
courts.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
this
court
did
not
specify.
this
court’s
opinion
was
very
brief,
but
it
was
in
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
barry
nakell
no
your
honor
i
do
not
believe
that,
that
would
be
necessary.
i
think
that
what
is
required
is
that
the
prisoners
have
a
right,
a
constitutional
right
to
meaningful
access
to
the
courts,
and
i
believe
that
this
is
a
flexible
standard.
in
ross
v.
moffitt
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
right
to
counsel
on
petitioning
for
discretionary
review
and
discussed
both
due
process
and
equal
protection
in
the
course
of
that
opinion,
but
due
process,
as
the
court
pointed
out,
is
a
concept
of
fairness,
and
fairness
may
be
flexible.
so
that,
whereas
counsel
would
not
be
required
something
less,
something
other
than
counsel
might
be
required.
i
think
the
decision
in
ross
v.
moffitt
makes
legal
research
facilities
even
more
important.
mr.
barry
nakell
that
certainly
was
the
very
special
concern
of
this
court
when
it
decided
johnson
v.
avery,
who
was
illiterate
and
uneducated
inmate,
and
the
court
there
was
specifically
talking
about
his
constitutional
right
to
have.
mr.
justice
white
in
his
dissenting
opinion
expressed
the
view
that
we
should
not
necessary
just
allow
writ
writers
to
operate
and
forbid
the
states
from
prohibiting
them,
but
we
should
do
something
about
providing
this
kind
of
help.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
there
again,
not
necessarily
a
lawyer
your
honor
but
something
else,
and
i
think
that
the
provision
in
this
plan
for
the
training
and
use
of
about
21
inmate
paralegals
would
satisfy
that
requirement.
mr.
barry
nakell
it
has
constitutionally
obligated
to
provide
him
some
form
of
help
and
that
is
up
to
the
state
in
the
first
instance
to
decide
what
the
help
should
be.
mr.
barry
nakell
not
necessarily.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
i
would
think
that
something
in
that
area
would
be
reasonable.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
my
point
in
not
addressing
myself
specifically
what
the
requirement
is
your
honor
is
simply
that
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
took
the
position
that
the
method
of
complying
with
the
constitutional
requirement
was
up
to
the
state,
and
left
it
to
the
state
as
the
court
did
in
younger
v.
gilmore
to
decide
exactly
how
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirement.
the
state
may
find
some
other
way
to
do
it.
mr.
barry
nakell
hopefully,
if
the
court
affirms
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals,
my
answer
would
be
that
the
trained
inmate
paralegals
would
satisfy
this
requirement.
well
there
is
something
else
we
do
--
mr.
barry
nakell
that
something
is
constitutionally
required
and
this
might
--
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
there
may
be
some
other
way
of
being
able
to
accomplish?
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
possibly
the
use
of
employees
maybe
able
to
--
employees
who
are
trained
and
perhaps
they
would
be
characterized
as
paralegals
as
well
to
help
him.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
necessarily
can
and
i
would
think
that
trained
paralegals
as
a
minimum
would
be
required,
but
there
may
be
a
way
that
the
state
could
formulate
to
provide
this
kind
of
help
without
doing
that,
and
the
matter
would
be
left
to
the
state
to
formulate
i
think.
the
district
court
in
this
case
hew
to
that
and
i
think
properly
so,
left
it
up
to
the
state
to
formulate
the
plan
and
the
plan
that
we
have
for
review
now
is
the
plan
submitted
by
the
state.
i
might
say
with
--
mr.
barry
nakell
yes,
of
course,
but
certainly
it
is
clear
that
the
--
my
point
is
simply
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
themselves
undertake
to
make
the
decision,
otherwise
they
have
made
clear
that
if
the
decision
were
up
to
them,
they
would
have
provided
legal
counsel.
i
think
they
both
gave
an
indication
that
they
would
find
that
to
be
a
preferable
system.
i
might
point
out
that
the
great
success
in
younger
v.
gilmore
has
been
a
great
success,
and
the
great
success
that
is
enjoyed
in
my
judgment
is
due
in
large
part
to
the
use
of
trained
inmate
paralegals.
the
literature
has
shown
that
the
training
programs
for
inmate
paralegals
has
been
very
successful,
indeed
the
state
of
michigan
just
graduated
its
first
class
of
inmate
paralegals
last
week
with
a
major
graduation
ceremony
presided
over
by
the
chief
justice
of
the
state.
those
jurisdictions
that
have
used
inmate
paralegals
have
found
them
to
be
very,
very
useful,
and
this
in
my
judgment
is
really
the
secret
to
why
these
programs
have
been
so
successful,
far
more
successful
than
we
would
expect
law
books
alone
to
be,
and
people
have
been
surprised
by
how
well
inmate
paralegals
have
functioned.
indeed
we
see
many
prison
systems
have
gone
on
to
training
their
employees
who
then
also
serve
to
help
prisoners.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
your
honor,
i
want
to
make
--
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
state
in
its
brief
at
least
advanced
no
contention
that
there
would
be
any
interference
with
its
management
function
or
security
function
or
rehabilitation
function
in
the
prison
by
this.
mr.
barry
nakell
now
they
say
that
--
well,
i
think
that
is
inconsistent
first
of
all
with
their
basic
premise
that
the
way
that
they
meet
johnson
v.
avery
is
by
letting
writ
writers
operate
in
the
prison,
and
i
think
that
once
we
put
the
libraries
in
the
prison
it
is
going
to
diminish
the
powerbase
of
writ
writers
because
it
is
going
to
make
legal
research
facilities
available
generally
and
not
just
to
the
writ
writers.
moreover,
the
plan
provides
for
very
limited
access
to
the
libraries.
the
plan
contemplates
the
350
prisoners
will
be
able
to
use
the
libraries
a
week,
and
that
will
mean
that
a
person
will
have
to
wait
three
to
four
weeks
to
get
his
turn
in
the
library
for
a
day.
writ
writers
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
flourish
under
that
system
any
better
than
they
can
under
the
present
system
where
a
few
people
may
have
access
to
the
only
and
very,
very
limited
legal
information
that
is
available.
so,
there
is
nothing
in
this
plan
that
would
facilitate
the
flourishing
of
inmate
writ
writers
or
the
development
by
them
of
the
powerbase.
mr.
barry
nakell
no,
your
honor,
no.
we
would
be
perfectly
satisfied
to
have
the
court
approve
the
plan
as
it
was
approved
by
the
district
court
with
minor
modifications
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
with
one
minor
modification.
we
would,
i
might
say,
be
very
pleased
to
entertain
some
suggestion
about
providing
counsel
because
we
think
that
would
be
better,
but
we
would
recognize
that
the
constitutional
obligation
under
younger
v.
gilmore
is
satisfied
by
the
plan
that
we
have.
the
american
correctional
association
--
mr.
barry
nakell
i
would
agree.
mr.
barry
nakell
no,
there
is
no
state
law
library
as
such.
there
are
law
libraries
at
the
supreme
court
and
at
the
state
law
schools,
and
as
i
understand
they
maybe
able
to
get
cases
from
the
libraries
at
the
supreme
court
or
the
state
law
library
if
they
pay
10
cents
a
page.
i
believe
that
is
the
going
rate,
10
cents
a
page.
mr.
barry
nakell
first,
your
honor
we
are
talking
about
the
north
carolina
prison
system
where
people
are
placed
generally
--
there
are
few
people
place
their
pending
trial,
but
generally
people
who
have
already
been
convicted
to
the
stage.
secondly,
in
term
--
mr.
barry
nakell
yes,
i
would
assume
so
your
honor.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
mr.
justice
stevens,
of
course,
raised
the
question
of
whether
counsel
is
necessary,
whether
counsel
would
be
an
adequate
substitute,
and
if
counsel
were
provided
and
a
prisoner
do
not
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
provision
that
was
made,
i
think
the
obligation
of
the
state
would
be
satisfied,
because
the
obligation
of
the
state
is
not
to
do
whatever
is
necessary
in
order
to
satisfy
the
inmate,
but
is
only
to
do
whatever
is
necessary
or
reasonably
necessary
in
order
to
assure
the
inmate’s
access
to
the
courts.
because
a
particular
prisoner
might
prefer
a
different
method,
and
i
can
imagine
prisoners
even
not
in
that
situation,
prisoners
who
are
in
post
conviction
or
1983
actions,
or
civil
right
actions
in
state
court,
who
would
prefer
to
have
a
library
rather
can
counsel.
that
personal
preference
of
the
inmate
in
that
circumstance
would
not
control
i
think;
it
is
not
a
faretta
type
situation
at
all.
it
is
a
situation
in
which
the
state’s
obligation
is
not
to
provide,
necessarily
to
provide
counsel,
but
is
only
to
provide
the
means
reasonably
necessary
in
order
to
ensure
the
prisoner
meaningful
access
to
the
court.
that
is
a
different
standard
than
the
standard
that
applies
in
situations
where
the
inmate
would
be
entitled
to
the
right
counsel,
and
therefore
i
do
not
see
any
problem
or
conflict
in
that
particular
circumstance.
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
american
correctional
association
in
may
of
this
year,
development
i
learned
about
since
filing
my
brief,
came
out
with
a
statement
of
responses
to
the
national
advisory
commission
recommendations,
and
they
either
accepted
or
rejected
or
modified
the
recommendations.
they
with
regard
to
the
national
advisory
commission
recommendation
for
access
to
legal
services,
they
accepted
that
which
would
provide
for
a
library
equivalent
to
what
is
provided
for
in
the
state’s
plan
in
every
prison
with
a
design
capacity
of
100
or
more.
mr.
barry
nakell
that
is
absolutely
correct
your
honor.
i
just
think
the
court
should
be
informed
about
the
opinions
of
professional
correctional
administrators
and
--
mr.
barry
nakell
no,
your
honor
just
because
it
is
done,
but
not
necessarily
be
a
commitment
on
the
constitutional
issue.
but
i
think
that
is
important
to
know
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
brought
out
i
think
that
even
the
state
of
north
carolina
has
taken
the
position
that
meaning
access
to
the
courts
for
prisoners
requires
that
they
would
be
given
access
at
least
to
legal
services.
this
was
in
the
leaa
grant
application.
i
understood
mr.
safron
to
characterize,
that
is
as
puffing
or
as
salesmanship
or
saying
whatever
was
necessary
to
get
an
leaa
grant.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
state
would
also
say
whatever
is
necessary
in
order
to
get
an
order
from
this
court.
the
state
has
taken
the
position
that
this
is
necessary
and
that
it
will
have
the
collateral
effects
which
have
been
experienced
in
many
other
states,
that
is,
it
has
reduced
the
number
of
frivolous
petitions
and
has
increased
the
quality
of
petitions
and
all
the
other
states
have
implemented
it.
mr.
barry
nakell
at
their
grant
application.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
i
assume
that
their
petitions
--
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
i
can
not
say
that
there
would,
i
would
agree
with
that,
but
of
course
their
petition
and
their
brief
in
this
case
were
necessitated
by
the
same
district
court
order.
mr.
barry
nakell
well,
i
think
so.
mr.
barry
nakell
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
the
leaa
application
of
course
has
another
important
factor
that
bears
on
our
case,
and
that
is
the
state
has
represented
that
the
cost
factor,
meeting
the
district
court’s
order
or
meeting
the
plan
that
they
themselves
proposed,
would
require
a
distribution,
a
redistribution
of
services
from
something
else
that
the
department
of
corrections
is
providing.
the
leaa
application
shows
that
the
state
was
planning
all
this
time
to
apply
to
the
federal
government
for
90%
funding
of
the
initial
cost
and
90%
funding
of
the
expenses
for
the
first
couple
of
years
of
the
program,
and
that
they
have
every
reasonable
expectation
of
being
funded
in
that
way
because
leaa
has
funded
other
programs
and
indeed
has
funded
programs
to
greater
sums
of
money,
particularly
program
which
have
gone
on
beyond
younger
v.
gilmore
and
provided
legal
services
to
varying
degrees
including
many
states
which
you
have
provided
legal
services
in
a
comprehensive
manner.
we
just
do
not
agree
that
the
state
of
california
--
state
of
north
carolina,
excuse
me,
in
this
case
can
not
afford
to
meet
its
prisoners’
constitutional
needs
in
this
respect.
on
june
30,
1975
the
fiscal
year
ending
then,
the
state
of
north
carolina
--
excuse
me,
my
time
is
up.
