mr.
amos
m.
matthews
i'll
try
to
be
very
brief.
i
won't
take
too
long
if
i
may.
and
perhaps
i
can
save
time
by
simply
surrogate
and
following
on
the
points
the
counsel
has
made.
in
the
first
place,
counsel
attempts
to
say
that
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
transfer
is
what
he
calls
an
independent
contractor
that
section
202
(c)
doesn't
govern
here.
well,
now
section
202
(c)
(2)
says
that
it
governs
transportation
by
motor
vehicle
by
any
person
whether
as
agent
or
under
a
contractual
arrangement.
now,
whatever
else
you
can
say
about
the
contract
between
transfer
and
the
railroads
which
appears
beginning
at
page
25
of
the
record.
it's
a
long
contract.
it
is
a
contractual
arrangement
but
no
question
about
that,
so
it
is
squarely
within
the
terms
of
section
202
(c)
and
you
can't
escape
that
by
saying,
"well,
obviously
if
you
have
a
written
contract
whereby
you
make
somebody
an
independent
contractor
that
nevertheless
would
mean
it's
a
contractual
arrangement."
now,
the
counsel
has
mentioned
that
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
last
monday
in
the
public
utilities
commission
of
california
against
united
states
and
perhaps
i
do
not
need
to
advert
to
that
but
it
seems
to
me
this
one
sentence
that
i
would
like
to
read
fits
this
case
perfectly
on
all
of
this
talk
about
exhausting
administrative
remedies.
and
that
is
this,
but
where
the
only
the
question
is
whether
it
is
constitutional
to
fasten
the
administrative
procedure
onto
a
litigant
--
onto
the
litigant,
the
administrative
agency
may
be
defied
and
judicial
relief
sought
as
the
only
effective
way
of
protecting
the
asserted
constitutional
right.
that
is
precisely
this
case.
and
the
chief
justice
says
perfectly
characterized
this
because
after
you
get
all
through
with
your
so-called
administrative
procedure,
nevertheless,
the
chicago
city
council
says
you've
got
to
come
in
and
lobby
us
before
you
can
operate.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
yes,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
oh
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
i'm
going
to
withdraw
my
answer
and
say
no,
sir,
in
this
that
the
commerce
commission
of
the
state
of
illinois
would
have
no
authority
to
say
who
shall
engage
in
interstate
commerce
in
illinois.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
i
don't
know.
and
frankly,
i've
never
thought
of
that
but
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
but
it
is
--
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
you
can
be
for
this
reason
that
public
service
commissions
and
regulatory
commissions
are
traditionally
governed
by
certain
processes
of
--
of
weighing
the
evidence
and
making
findings
of
fact
and
so
forth.
and
well,
yes,
i'll
get
warm
up
to
this.
i
can
see
a
lot
of
difference.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
if
the
--
if
the
public
utilities
--
if
the
public
utilities
commission
of
illinois
denies
a
certificate
on
constitutional
grounds,
the
courts
of
illinois
can
review
that
but
the
courts
of
illinois
cannot
review
the
discretion
of
the
chicago
city
council.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
the
question
--
i
--
i
think
we
don't
need
even
to
go
into
that
for
this
reason.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
that
the
--
this
court
has
never
held
and
in
the
long
line
of
cases
it
has
held
to
the
contrary.
this
court
has
always
held
that
where
a
discretion
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
as
to
who
shall
conduct
the
commerce
is
vested
in
a
state
or
in
municipality
every
such
regulation
has
been
struck
down
by
this
court.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
that
far.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
not
at
the
discretion.
there
is,
of
course,
to
review
in
the
courts,
their
ordinary
review
of
the
validity
whether
the
action
is
within
the
power
of
the
city
or
whether
it's
constitutional.
but
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no.
you
mean
if
the
city
council
just
did
nothing?
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
absolutely
no
reviews.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
you
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
mandamus
the
city
council
to
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
they
always
are.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
oh,
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
unquestionable.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
only
--
only
if
it
were
unconstitutional.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
certainly,
certainly.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
however,
it's
doubtful
whether
if
they
--
if
they
said
"we're
not
going
to
let
any
negroes
have
barber
licenses.”
you
wouldn't
need
to
apply
for
a
license.
you
could
go
into
federal
court
and
get
--
get
an
injunction
tomorrow
i
assume.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
i
want
to
--
maybe
i
can
answer
that
as
i
cast
on
to
something
else.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
now,
i
want
to
go
now
to
a
question
that
has
been
raised
as
to
the
status
of
parmelee
case.
now
in
the
--
that
has
been
adverted
to
by
counsel
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
sole
question
in
that
case
was
whether
the
employees
of
parmelee
were
by
virtue
of
the
arrangement
between
parmelee
and
the
railroads
if
that
make
those
employees,
railroad
employees,
so
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
railroad
labor
act.
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
resting
its
decision
squarely
and
entirely
within
the
framework
of
the
federal
statutes
said
that
--
that
parmelee
was
not
a
carrier
in
and
of
itself
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act.
therefore,
its
employees
were
not
employees
of
a
carrier
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act.
but
that
case
is
precisely
what
i
was
saying
this
morning,
namely,
that
the
activities
of
--
of
transfer
are
simply
assimilated
to
the
operations
of
the
railroads
specifically
by
202
(c)
(2),
they
are
made
railroad
operation.
now,
however,
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
other
decisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
respect
to
202
(c)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
in
pick
up
of
livestock
in
illinois
island
and
wisconsin
and
i'm
--
i'm
referring
now
briefly
to
some
cases
on
pages
31
--
21
to
23
of
our
brief.
in
pick
up
of
livestock
in
illinois
island
and
wisconsin,
the
railroads
filed
tariffs
providing
for
pick
up
of
livestock
within
10
miles
of
their
stations
that
is
they'd
--
they'd
go
out
and
bring
them
in
and
load
them
in
cars.
this
was
before
the
enactment
of
202
(c).the
--
that
matter
was
brought
before
the
commission
by
a
complaint
of
some
motor
carriers
and
the
commission
said
this
that
that
was
a
motor
carrier
operation.
the
railroad
had
no
authority
under
part
2.
it
was
not
a
railroad
operation
under
part
1.
therefore,
the
railroads
were
ordered
to
cancel
their
tariffs
and
cease
and
desist
from
the
operation.
after
that,
202
(c)
was
enacted
and
the
commission
reopened
it.
and
then
the
commission
said
the
railroads
now
do
not
need
any
certificate
under
part
2,
202
(c)
has
made
it
a
railroad
operation
under
part
1.
we
will
now
approve
the
tariffs
of
the
railroads
providing
for
pick
up
of
livestock
by
motor
truck
within
10
miles
of
their
stations.
in
other
words,
that
shows
by
the
construction
of
the
commission
exactly
the
rights
given
by
202
(c)
to
the
--
to
the
railroads
that
they
are
given
in
effect
permanent
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
perform
motor
carrier
operations,
pick
up
and
delivery
and
transfer
in
their
terminal
areas.
now,
in
cartridge
rail,
the
steamship
lines
at
new
york.
the
railroads
attempted
to
cancel
tariffs.
the
railroads
had
filed
tariffs
providing
for
pickup
and
delivery
in
inter-station
service
of
freight
in
new
york.
the
railroads
attempted
to
cancel
those
tariffs
and
the
commission
held
in
that
case
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
require
performance
of
the
service.
now,
any
service
that
is
performed
under
tariff
and
which
the
commission
has
authority
to
require
is
a
service
that
is,
i
submit,
safe
from
any
obstruction
by
state
action,
going
again
to
another
case
of
the
commission
construing
202
(c),
movement
of
highway
trailers
by
rail.
i'm
sure
you
all
take
--
you've
--
you've
all
read
about
it
and
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
tremendous
railroad
traffic
growing
up
in
what
is
so-called
piggyback
service.
that
is
a
trailer
within
a
railroad
terminal
area
that
picks
up
freight.
the
trailer
is
hauled
to
the
railroad
yard
and
loaded
on
a
flat
car,
carried
by
the
flat
car
to
destination.
the
trailer
unloads
it
and
it's
delivered
to
destination.
in
a
--
an
extensive
hearing
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
commission
held
that
that
entire
operation
is
railroad
service
subject
to
part
1
of
the
act
and
that
in
order
to
perform
that
service,
the
railroads
do
not
need
any
authority
under
part
2
on
account
of
section
202
(c).
now,
if
cities
all
along
the
line
can
impose
obstructions
and
require
a
showing
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
the
transfer
of
property
and
the
persons
in
terminal
areas,
202
(c)
and
the
intention
of
congress
in
respect
to
it
is
completely
set
at
naught.
now,
i
want
to
refer
now
to
castle
against
hayes
freight
lines.
no,
i
--
i
will
first
refer
to
columbia
terminal's
case
and
the
bradley
against
the
public
utilities
commission.
now,
both
of
those
cases
are
immediately
differentiated
in
this
respect
that
the
columbia
terminal's
case
was
decided
before
the
enactment
of
section
202
(c)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
true
enough,
columbia
terminals
was
performing
inter-station
pickup
and
delivery,
but
202
(c)
had
not
yet
been
enacted
by
the
--
and
that
--
that
is
precisely
the
--
that
the
--
the
district
court
rested
its
decision
on
two
grounds
that
there
was
no
supersedure
by
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
hadn't
--
hadn't
entered
the
field,
the
pick
up
and
delivery
service.
in
bradley
against
public
utilities
commission,
it
again
rested
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
government
had
not
entered
the
field.
now,
i
want
to
go
to
castle
against
hayes
freight
lines
because
i
think
that
case
is
directly
in
point
here.
castle
against
hayes
freight
lines
involved
an
illinois
statute
in
which
the
state
of
illinois
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
and
abuse
of
its
highways
as
the
court
pointed
out
by
overloading
--
chronic
overloading
of
motor
trucks.
the
state
passed
an
act
that
a
chronic
overloader
could
be
suspended
from
the
use
of
the
illinois
highways
for
10
days
for
--
for
three
months
and
on
the
second
offense
prolonged.and
this
court
held
that
since
castle
had
a
certificate
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
which
it
was
required
to
perform
service
and
in
as
much
as
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
the
power
to
suspend
that
certificate
that
a
power
--
a
--
an
assertive
power
of
suspension
of
castle's
rights
in
the
state
was
violative
of
the
commerce
clause
and
the
interstate
commerce
act.
you
have
precisely
the
same
situation
here
because
the
railroads
are
vested
with
this
right
to
perform
the
inter-station
transfer
service
by
section
202
(c)
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
there
is
this
however
this
difference
that
did
not
appear
in
the
castle
case.
to
the
hayes
freight
lines
could
file
a
cancellation
of
its
schedules
and
could
cease
all
operations
in
30
days
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
nobody
else
could
do
anything
about
it.
if
the
railroads
filed
a
cancellation
of
their
tariffs
providing
for
the
inter-station
transfer
of
railroad
passengers,
the
commission
under
its
own
holdings,
no
court
has
passed
on
this
but
the
commission
has
so
held
in
the
case
i
cite.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
could
compel
the
continuance
of
that
inter-station
transfer
service.
so
in
the
castle
case,
you
held
that
a
carrier
who
was
not
required,
who
was
authorized,
it's
true
to
render
service
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
but
was
not
required
to
do
so
could
not
be
interfered
with
by
the
state
on
purely
safety
grounds,
nothing
but
sheer
police
power
grounds.
but
here,
you
have
a
case
where
the
service
--
the
commission
as
held
can
be
compelled.
we
can't
quit
if
the
interstate
commerce
commission
says
we
can't
quit.
yet,
the
city
of
chicago
purports
to
say
that
it
is
going
to
say
who
shall
--
who
the
railroad
shall
make
a
contract
with.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
the
city
of
chicago
is
doing
exactly
what
the
state
of
new
york
did
in
gibbons
against
ogden.
it
said
--
it
is
saying
"nobody
shall
render
this
inter-station
transfer
service
for
the
railroads
unless
we
approve
them."
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
oh,
yes,
if
the
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
if
the
--
if
the
chicago
ordinance
should
be
held
valid
then
we've
got
--
then
--
then
we
either
have
to
go
back
to
doing
business
with
transfer
or
we
can't
transfer
the
passengers.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
that
is
correct
and
that
is
unconstitutional
under
every
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
my
associate
called
me
to
one
point
that
i
should
have
mentioned
before.
sorry,
i
didn't.
in
the
interchange
--
and
--
and
that
is
in
our
complaint,
and
alleged
in
great
detail
and
admitted
of
course
by
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
railroads
coming
into
chicago
have
certain
schedules
to
meet.
that
is
taking
a
passenger
from
one
station
to
another
station.
the
railroads
want
to
control
that
service
to
give
good
service
to
the
passengers.
the
--
besides
all
of
the
considerations
in
the
express
language
of
202
(c)
(2),
the
railroads
have
a
right
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
to
select
their
own
agent
where
the
railroads
are,
at
least
a
number
of
railroad
presidents
have
said
so,
are
fighting
a
very
battle
for
their
very
lives
and
the
passenger
service
is
one
of
their
most
vulnerable
points.
and
certainly,
the
railroads
in
their
relations
with
the
public
and
in
maintaining
their
passenger
service
have
a
right
to
say
who
shall
carry
their
passengers
from
one
chicago
station
to
another.
and
in
the
maintenance
of
--
and
have
a
carrier
who
will
take
a
passenger
from
the
northwestern
station
to
the
illinois
central
station
some
two
miles
away
and
getting
there
in
time
to
catch
the
train
for
springfield
in
new
orleans.
that
i
think
is
the
--
is
the
consideration
and
the
--
the
--
may
i
call
your
attention
again
to
the
--
the
hill
against
florida
covers,
your
honors,
exact
point
as
i
understand
it.
in
hill
against
florida,
the
state
of
florida,
a
licensed
representative
of
labor
unions
and
said,
“nobody
can
be
a
bargaining
agent
for
a
labor
union
in
the
state
of
florida
unless
he's
licensed
by
the
state
of
florida.”
on
this
case,
this
court
said
the
state
of
florida
can't
do
that,
that
employees
have
a
right
to
be
represented
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
in
the
bargaining
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
have
a
right
to
be
represented
by
their
own
representatives
and
that
--
that
the
state
of
florida
simply
cannot
interfere
with
that
right
by
demanding
a
license
and
that's
exactly
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
it
hadn't
said
anything
in
specific
terms.
i
grant
you
that.
but
it
has
said
that
the
--
the
person
you
can
--
you
can
make
a
contract
with
a
person
and
then
he
becomes
your
service.
and
certainly,
the
commerce
clause
and
the
interstate
commerce
act
gives
the
railroads,
i
think
just
on
the
bear
statement
of
it,
gives
the
railroads
the
right
to
say
who
that
agent
shall
be.
that
is
my
position
on
that.
now
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
yes.
well
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
of
--
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
that
is
correct.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
yes.
and
i
think
it
would
--
i
think
we
can
--
i
was
about
to
touch
on
that
--
the
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
i'm
not
--
not
under
the
constitution,
no,
i
don't
believe
you
would.
however,
we
--
we
are
making
no
objection
that
grandfather
clause
to
parmelee.
that,
i
don't
think
that
is
--
is
an
issue
in
the
case.
the
merely
is
descriptive
of
what
the
city
council
did.
they
gave
--
but
--
but
on
connection,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
with
--
with
what
you've
recently
said.
i
want
to
go
back
to
case
of
a
venerable
history
namely
the
pensacola
telegraph
case.
there,
the
state
of
florida
simply
said
“no
telegraph
company
can
come
in
to
the
state
unless
it
has
a
license
from
the
state.”
and
congress,
for
the
express
purpose
of
avoiding
that,
provided
for
federal
licenses
for
telegraph
companies
and
this
court
held
that
the
florida
law
couldn't
keep
the
western
union
telegraph
out.
now
as
i
say,
the
--
the
question
of
who
shall
conduct
interstate
commerce
is
the
important
question
in
all
of
these
cases
from
gibbons
against
ogden
on
down.
i
want
to
refer
now
to
some
couple
of
other
federal
statutes.
in
1866,
congress
passed
an
act
that
has
been
variously
called
the
--
the
"railroad
communication
interchange
act
of
1866."
i
set
it
out
on
page
26
in
my
brief.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
shows
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
had
provided
by
a
new
jersey
law
had
--
had
granted
an
exclusive
franchise
to
a
certain
railroad
and
said
that
no
other
railroad
could
operate
between
philadelphia
and
new
york,
which
of
course
are
both
outside
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
unless
the
legislature
of
new
jersey
agreed.
congress
passed
the
--
a
law
which
says
this
and
i
think
it's
entirely
applicable
to
this
situation
today,
"every
railroad
company
in
the
united
states
is
hereby
authorized
to
carry
upon
and
over
its
road
and
so
forth,
passengers
on
their
way
from
any
state
to
another
state
and
to
receive
compensation
therefore
and
to
connect
with
roads
of
other
states
so
as
to
form
continuous
lines
for
the
transportation
of
the
same
to
the
place
of
destination."
and
this
court
has
construed
that
act
in
a
number
of
cases,
in
the
bowman
against
the
chicago
and
northwestern
railroad.
the
court
said,
these
acts
referring
to
that
another
act
were
passed
under
the
power
vested
in
congress
were
designed
to
remove
trammels
upon
transportation
between
different
states
which
had
previously
existed
and
to
prevent
a
creation
of
such
trammels
in
the
future
and
to
facilitate
railway
transportation.
in
union
pacific
against
rock
island
railroad
cited
on
page
30,
the
court
said,
“it
is
impossible
for
us
to
ignore
the
great
public
policy
in
favor
of
continuous
lines
thus
declared
by
congress
and
that
such
it
is
in
effectuation
of
that
policy
that
such
business
arrangements
as
it
will
make
such
connections
effective
are
made.”
coming
now
to
the
last
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
that
argument
is
unsound
on
two
bases.
in
the
first
place,
the
congress
has
exercised
the
power
here.
in
other
words,
if
it
were
not
for
section
202
(c)
(2),
the
railroads
could
not
conduct
this
inter-station
transfer
operation
without
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
from
the
commission
under
part
2.
but
the
congress
has
given
the
railroads
permanent
motor
carrier
authority
rights
under
section
202
(c)
(2).
they
--
they've
given
them
just
as
effective
rights
as
hayes
freight
lines
had
so
congress
has
entered
the
field.
the
second
answer
to
that
is
that
assuming
for
purpose
of
argument
that
congress
has
not
entered
the
field,
there
is
a
very
long
line
of
cases.
i
cite
them
on
page
37
to
the
effect
that
no
state
or
municipality
can
exercise
its
discretion
as
to
whether
it
is
going
to
permit
the
performance
of
interstate
commerce.
and
under
the
cases,
this
court
in
140
years,
the
question
of
who
is
going
to
perform
interstate
commerce
as
between
two
rival
candidates
is
a
function
that
is
forbidden
to
the
states
by
the
commerce
clause
so
this
court
has
held.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
he's
in
error
about
that
because
the
--
the
commission
has
already
exercised
this
authority.
of
course
the
commission
exercised
its
authority
in
given
situations
but
if
it
exercised
its
authority
in
new
york
in
a
precisely
similar
situation
to
the
chicago
situation
then
the
commission
certainly
has
entered
the
field
of
regulation.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no,
sir,
it
has
not.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no,
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no,
it
has
not
done
so
but
it
has
said
that
it
can
compel
the
railroads
to
perform
the
service
and
it
has
compelled
them
to
perform
it.
and
if
the
railroads
are
compelled
to
perform
it,
the
railroads
certainly
have
the
power
to
select
under
the
--
the
contracting
party
to
perform
it
for
them.
they
can't
be
deprived
of
that.
perhaps
congress
could
deprive
them
of
that
power
but
certainly
the
states
and
local
governments
can't
deprive
them
of
that
power.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
because
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no,
sir.
i
--
i
disagree
with
your
construction.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
it
--
its
wrong
for
this
reason
that
it
says
that
despite
in
effect,
it
says
despite
the
--
the
provisions
of
part
1,
you
are
hereby
authorized
to
go
ahead
and
operate
and
to
make
contracts
with
another
to
operate
for
you,
pick
up
and
delivery
service
in
inter-station
areas.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
i
--
i'm
--
under
two
i
--
i
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
section
202
(c)
(2)
doesn't
give
any
rights
to
the
inter-station
carrier
itself
but
it
does
give
rights
to
the
railroads.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
their
nature
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
this.
that
the
railroads
are
performing
transportation
under
part
1
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
they
are
part
of
the
service.
they
are
required
to
perform
and
were
required
to
perform
before
202
(c)
was
enacted
is
the
transfer
of
freight
and
passengers
between
their
stations.
they
have
been
doing
that
for
many
years
in
a
case
that's
involving
the
transfer
in
st.louis.
i
cited
the
case
before
202
(c)
was
enacted.
this
court
held
that
a
contract
of
this
character
between
a
railroad
--
between
the
st.louis
railroads
and
an
inter-station
carrier
could
not
be
enjoined
under
the
antitrust
laws
because
it
was
within
that
exemption
from
injunction
under
the
antitrust
laws
any
--
of
any
right
arising
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
this
court
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
transfer.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
question,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
well,
that's
what
we
do
claim.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
i
--
well,
i
may
--
i
may
have
misspoken.
the
congress
has
given
us.
congress
didn't
exempt
us
from
anything
in
202
(c).
the
congress
gave
the
railroads
who
were
engaging
in
commerce
the
right
to
continue
that
commerce,
a
permanent
--
a
permanent
certificate
by
statute.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
that's
right.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
or
they
can
do
it
themselves
without
--
or
they
can
--
or
they
can
select
somebody
by
contract,
yes.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
that's
right.
that
is
my
point.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
no,
well
under
part
2,
we
need
202
(c)
because
part
2
is
on
the
statute.
if
it
wasn't
for
202
(c),
we'd
have
to
apply
for
a
certificate
under
part
2
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
that's
right.
well,
i
--
i
--
we
claim
under
both
that
--
that
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
i
didn't
understand
that,
sir.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
that
is
correct.
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
it's
our
position
that's
--
mr.
amos
m.
matthews
we're
--
that
that's
right.
we
rely
first
on
the
stronger
position
that
congress
has
superseded
the
power
of
the
state
but
--
that
even
if
congress
hadn't
superseded
the
power
of
the
state,
we
would
still
have
the
power.
yes,
that
is
our
position
under
these
various
federal
statutes.
