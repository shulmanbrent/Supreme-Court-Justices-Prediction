mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
think
i
would
like
to
at
the
outset
of
this
case,
clarify
the
contentions
of
the
parties
and
then
analyze
this
act
189
which
is
unique
and
peculiar
and
is
special
legislation
but
not
aimed
at
united
states
property
but
aimed
at
the
purpose
of
eliminating
a
discrimination
between
lessees
of
users,
lessee
and
users
of
private
and
public
property.
first
of
all
a
contention
of
the
united
states
is
that
act
189
imposes
an
ad
velorem
tax
on
the
united
states,
since
the
full
value
of
the
property
is
used
as
a
measure
of
the
tax.
it
is
the
city
of
detroit's
contention
that
act
189
imposes
a
specific
tax,
not
a
property
tax,
on
the
tax
exempt
property
in
connection
with
the
business
conducted
for
a
profit
and
that
clause
is
very
important
and
that
such
a
tax
under
such
cases
as
plummer
versus
coler,
home
insurance
company,
these
all
are
decided
by
this
court.
home
insurance
company
versus
new
york,
educational
films
corporation,
pacific
versus
johnson,
plynth
versus
(inaudible),
tracy
and
last
but
not
least
esso
corporation.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
it
is.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
right.
but
it
must
be
born
in
mind
of
course
that
this
is
tax
on
a
privilege
and
property
of
the
united
states
maybe
used
as
a
measure
of
a
tax
on
the
privilege
as
provided
under
these
cases.
now
a
privilege
tax
does
not
have
to
be
proportional
to
the
values
of
the
same
tax.
the
same
tax
in
most
of
instances
of
course
is
the
privilege
of
using
the
property.
congress,
or
rather
the
legislature
of
michigan,
to
accomplish
its
purpose,
namely
to
avoid
discrimination
between
lessees
of
users
and
of
private
and
public
property
and
put
them
on
an
equal
footing,
may
choose
any
sum
it
wishes,
providing
it's
reasonable
to
accomplish
the
result
intended.
it
so
happened
that
in
this
case
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
the
lessee
of
private
property
does
pay
a
real
estate
tax,
either
in
the
rent
charge
or
in
addition
with
the
rent,
in
consideration
of
a
reduction
in
rent
(inaudible)
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
well
in
this
particular
case,
yes
it
would
in
this
particular
case
under
this
act.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
no,
but
the
lessee
by
virtue
or
leasing
property
from
a
private
lessor,
that
lessee
either
pays
the
tax
on
that
profit,
which
is
included
in
the
rent
charge
or
is
paid
in
addition
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
frankly
i'm
not
certain
of
that
at
this
point
your
honor.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
the
owner
of
the
property
pays
the
real
estate
taxes.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
under
general
ad
valorem
of
property
taxes
yes,
but
under
this
special
act
that
is
not
the
situation.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
this
act
has
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yeah
that's
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
no
it
does
not.
it
pays
the
tax
on
the
privilege
of
using
that
property.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
well
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
well
if
you
desire
to
take
that
position,
if
your
honor
please
i
can
understand
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
well
i
can
understand
the
practical
affect
of
it,
yes.
what
you
say
is
possibly
true
from
the
practical
effect
of
it,
but
when
you
have
a
privilege
tax,
you
can
do
that
very
thing,
by
you
using
the
government's
property
as
a
measure
of
the
tax.
now
that
is
the
only
way,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
state
of
michigan
could
eliminate
the
discrimination
between
lessees
of
private
and
public
property
by
fixing
some
sum
equal
to
the
amount
of
tax
paid
on
the
real
estate.
now
the
fact
that
it's
equal
to
the
amount
paid
on
the
real
estate
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
tax
is
on
the
real
estate
of
the
united
states.
it
could
have
been,
michigan
legislature
could
have
imposed
a
larger
for
the
privilege
used.
now
i'm
giving,
digressing
some
what
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
this
act
applies
to
tax
exempt
property
used
in
connection
with
the
business,
conducted
for
profit.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
in
connection
with
the
business
conducted
for
profit.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
no,
it
applies
to
the
united
states
property
as
well
as
any
properties
owned
by
the
state
of
michigan
or
any
of
its
political
subdivisions,
when
leased
or
used
in
connection
with
a
business
conducted
for
the
profit
to
a
private
individual,
corporation
or
association.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
the
tax
is
imposed
upon
the
lessee
or
user
of
the
property,
for
the
privilege
of
using
that
property.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes,
now
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes,
first
of
all
let
me
refer
your
honor
to
the
record,
page
97
thereof,
which
is
the
personal
property
assessment
roll
for
1954
involved
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
page
97.
now,
your
honors
will
note
the
first
parcel
of
property
appearing
on
that
assessment
roll
is
the
borg-warner
property.
your
honors
will
further
note
in
connection
with
the
borg-warner
property
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
page
97.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
of
the
record.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
mi'm
sorry
your
honor.
in
the
borg-warner
case,
that's
the
brown,
that's
a
brown
book.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
mr.
justice
black
you
have
that
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
you
have
it
mr.
justice
whitaker,
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
page
97.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
now
you
will
note
on
that
personal
property
assessment
roll
of
the
borg-warner
property
is
the
first
parcel
appearing
thereon.
you
will
note
also
that
right
next
to
that
name
appears
the
words,
act
189
pa
1953,
leased
land
bill.
that
applies
in
cases
of
all
the
four
parcels
on
that
assessment
roll.
now
the
reason
that
was
put
on
there
was
to
distinguish
it
from
ordinary
personal
property
put
on
a
personal
property
assessment
roll
and
that
which
would
be
subject
to
the
ordinary
provisions
of
the
statutes
concerning
personal
property
if
it
were
not
for
that
notation
placed
around
calling
all
persons
to
attention
--
the
attention
of
all
persons
to
the
fact
that
that
property
is
being
leased
under
act
189.
now
jefferson,
the
next
parcel
of
property
which
is
written
in
ink,
feldman
mitchell
looks
like
105
but
it's
actually
905
(inaudible),
that
parcel
of
real
estate
is
owned
by
the
state
of
michigan
and
it
is
leased
to
mr.
feldman
for
a
parking
lot.
the
next
parcel
of
real
estate
which
appears
in
the
name
of
houston
hayes
land
company
belongs
to
the
city
of
highland
park
and
that
parcel
of
real
estate
is
leased
to
houston
hayes
for
a
customer
parking
lot
in
connection
with
its
business
conducted
for
profit.
the
next
parcel
of
property
appearing
on
the
assessment
roll
is
jefferson
corporation.
that
case
is
--
the
property
involved
in
that
case
is
owned
by
the
united
states.
there
is
a
suit
pending
on
that
case
presently
pending
in
the
city
of
detroit
awaiting
the
outcome
and
decision
of
this
borg-warner
case.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
the
last
one
feldman
mitchell
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
there
was
error
made
there
judge
and
you
can
see
where
it's
transpired
up.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that
was
a
parcel
of
property
owned
by
the
state
of
michigan
and
leased
to
mr.
feldman
for
a
parking
lot
in
connection
with
the
business
conducted
for
profit.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
same
as
the
second.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
that's
right,
they
made
a
mistake
apparently
down
on
the
lower
or
rather
originally
it
was
listed
in
silverware
company,
you'll
notice
the
last,
the
last
name
appearing
thereon,
well
that
was
a
management
company.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
correct
your
honor.
so
it
doesn't
necessarily
and
it
doesn't
aim
at
the
united
states
property
in
particular
whether
it
includes
all
other
properties
of
the
state
of
michigan
or
any
of
its
political
subdivisions
leased
in
connection
with
the
business
conducted
for
profit.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes,
yes,
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
one
of
these
parcels
appearing
on
this
roll?
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
highland
park
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
that's
a
city
your
honor
and
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
and
it
was
owned
by
highland
park?
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
why
was
it
exempt?
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
because
it
was
owned
by
the
city
of
highland
park.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
right.
that's
right
that
lessee
would
pay
the
tax
because
the
charitable
institution
would
not
be
using
it
for
those
purposes.
it
would
be
leasing
it
out
to
a
private
person
in
connection
with
a
business
conducted
for
profit
and
rightfully
they
should
be
taxed.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
those
lessees
should
bear
some
of
the
burden.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
i
say
that
very
thing,
your
honor.
now
you
may
recall
in
some
of
these
other
cases
the
macallen
versus
massachusetts,
milwaukee
case
that
the
court
said
the
tax
may
very
well
be
valid
even
though
it
might
incidentally
affect
bonds
providing
us
–
not
aim
at
those
bonds
of
the
united
states
but
was
passed
with
a
different
intent
and
purpose.
now
the
intent
and
purpose
here
as
i
have
explained
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
michigan
was
to
impose
this
tax
to
seek
to
avoid
discrimination
between
lessees
of
public
and
private
properties.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
i
am
sure.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
except
there
are
certain
--
there
is
a
certain
exception
in
the
act
and
the
state
supported
educational
institutions
are
not
subject
to
the
tax.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that
is
correct
as
long
he
is
using
them
for
that
purpose.
now
there
is
a
vast
distinction
as
your
honors
may
well
know,
between
a
privilege
tax
and
an
ad
valorem
tax
on
the
property
itself.
an
ad
valorem
tax
goes
on
ad
infinitum
whether
the
property
is
being
using
or
not.
in
connection
with
act
189,
as
long
--
when
the
property
is
no
longer
used
then
there
is
no
tax
imposed
under
this
act.
it
has
to
be
used
in
connection
with
the
business
conducted
for
profit.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
in
this
case
we
contend
this
is
a
privilege
tax
in
the
murray
prior
there
too
that
involved
a
different
statute
entirely
of
the
city
of
detroit
or
a
charter
provision
statute,
both,
which
was
the
regular
ad
valorem
personal
property
tax
statute
which
provides
for
a
lien
on
property.
this
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
it
does
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
that
was
an
ordinary
ad
valorem
general
property
tax
statute
on
the
property
itself.
this
is
special
legislature
which
is
passed
for
taxing
the
privilege
of
using
and
not
aimed
at
the
united
states
property
in
any
(inaudible)
whatsoever.
now
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
your
honor.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
only
lands
that
come
in
under
this
act
189.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
lumped
in
with
a
whole
assessment
valuation.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
in
proportion
for
the
amount
of
property
he
is
using.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes
we
do
mr.
justice
warren.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
it's
very
well
taken
your
honor
please
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
for
lack
of
a
better
placed
put
it,
i
would,
you
know,
as
the
answer.
we
use
this
and
noted
on
this
roll,
leased
land
building
act
189
pa
1953
to
distinguish
the
properties
on
this
roll
from
properties
that
would
be
on
the
general
personal
property
assessment
role
and
subject
to
the
general
personal
property
assessment
taxes.
we
merely
use
this
form
and
placed
on
this
form
that
notation,
and
that
notation
also
was
included
in
the
bill,
tax
bill
that
was
sent
to
the
lessee
so
that
he
was
--
he
could
not
possibly
under
--
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
conclude
that
this
was
on
the
personal
property
assessment
roll
subject
to
general
personal
property
assessment
laws,
but
was
subject
to
the
provisions
of
act
189,
which
merely
taxes
the
use.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
you
might
call
it
that
your
honor.
the
act
was
--
the
act
was
new,
and
when
we
were
starting
to
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
they
are
your
honor.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
right.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
with
this
notation
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
correct
mr.
justice
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
i
think
frankly
they
are
using
the
same,
same
bills
that
they've
used
in
connection
with
general
personal
property
tax.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
what
this
notation
contained
on
it
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
correct
your
honor
and
of
course
as
i
have
previously
said
the
value
of
the
united
states
property
maybe
used
as
a
measure
of
the
tax
and
the
privilege
under
the
cases
that
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
and
i
believe
mentioned
a
short
while
ago.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
no
mr.
justice
black
i
have
not,
but
i
have
cited
plummer
versus
coler
for
example
which
is
an
inheritance
or
succession
tax
which
uses
the
full
value
of
the
united
states
bonds,
which
were
included
in
the
estate
as
a
measure
of
the
tax
of
the
inheritance
or
succession
tax
and
the
court
concluded
--
this
court
concluded
that
that
tax
was
not
on
the
bonds
of
the
united
states
which
are
--
were
exempt
from
taxation,
but
is
on
the
privilege
of
inheritance
or
succession.
now
in
connection
with
the
home
insurance
company
case,
which
was
a
new
york
case,
that
involved
a
franchise
tax,
measured
by
the
dividends
and
capital
stock
of
the
corporation.
included
in
the
capital
stock
of
the
corporation
were
united
states
bonds
which
of
course
were
tax
exempt.
they
were
included
as
a
measure,
the
value
of
those
bonds
along
with
other
properties
of
the
corporation
were
included
as
a
measure
of
the
tax
on
the
franchise,
which
the
court
said
could
be
done.
it
was
not
a
tax
on
the
bonds
but
on
the
franchise,
the
privilege
of
the
business
of
the
company
conducting
business.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
the
only
challenge
is
based
on
immunity.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
well,
miller
versus
milwaukee
if
your
honor
please
the
tax
the
--
miller
owned
dividends
in
a
milwaukee
corporation.
the
wisconsin
statute
provided
for
a
tax
on
everything
except
united
states
bonds.
they
were
accepted
from
the
privilege
tax
from
that
case
in
measuring
the
privilege
tax.
when
the
dividends
were
paid
out
to
mr.
miller,
the
stockholder,
the
wisconsin
statute
further
provided
that
he
should
be
taxed
on
those
dividends
only
to
the
extent
of
the
united
states
bonds,
the
value
of
the
united
states
bonds
and
the
court
held,
and
rightfully
so
in
that
case
if
your
honors
please,
that
that
statute
was
specifically
aimed
at
the
united
states
bonds.
now
of
course
that
case
did
not
--
well
as
i
recall
a
franchise
or
privilege
tax.
yes
the
miller
case
did
not
involve
a
franchise
or
privilege
tax
or
but
an
income
tax.
now
macallen
versus
massachusetts
which
government
counsel
cite
in
their
brief
as
controlling
of
the
situation,
the
statute
accepted
interest
from
united
states
bonds
and
determined
that
income
for
purposes
of
measuring
the
franchise
tax
on
domestic
corporations.
the
statute
was
later
amended
to
include
tax
exempt
securities
in
the
measure
of
the
franchise
tax.
so
that
amendment
was
specifically
aimed
at
the
united
states
bonds.
now
the
court
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
correct
your
honor
if
the
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
if
the
statute
is
aimed
at
the
united
states
bonds
and
is
not
specifically,
then
it's
an
invalid
tax.
now
of
course
in
our
case
we
contend
that
it
is
not
aimed
at
the
united
states
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
pardon?
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
right.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
correct
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
that's
very
true.
in
carmichael
versus
southern
coal
&
coke
company
which
i've
cited
at
page
28
of
my
brief
and
from
which
i
quote
says
this
in
connection
with
the
tax
and
classes
and
with
reference
to
exemptions,
there
are
exemptions
provided
in
this
act,
189
which
i
will
later
discuss.
carmichael
versus
southern
coal
company
decided
by
this
court
in
1937,
and
i
quote
therefrom
as
follows.
“it
is
inherent
in
the
exercise
of
the
power
to
tax
that
a
state
be
free
to
select
the
subjects
of
taxation
and
to
grant
exemptions.
neither
due
process
nor
equal
protection
imposes
upon
a
state
any
rigid
rule
of
equality
of
taxation.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
inequalities
which
result
from
a
singling
out
of
one
particular
class
for
taxation
or
exemptions
infringe
no
constitutional
limitation,
citing
many
cases.
like
considerations
govern
exemptions
from
the
operation
of
a
tax
imposed
upon
the
members
of
the
class.
a
legislature
is
not
bound
to
tax
every
member
of
a
class
or
not.
it
may
make
distinctions
of
degree,
having
a
rational
basis
and
when
subjected
to
judicial
scrutiny,
they
must
be
presumed
to
rest
on
that
basis
if
there
is
any
conceivable
state
of
facts
which
would
support
it.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
pardon?
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
a
property
of
any
state
--
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
a
property
of
any
state
supported
education
institution
is
one
of
the
exemptions
in
act
189.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
yes,
there
are
two
others
and
the
two
are
these,
where
the
use
is
by
way
of
a
concession
in
or
relative
to
use
of
a
public
airport,
park,
market,
fairground
or
other
similar
property,
which
is
available
to
the
use
of
the
general
public
and
one
more.
in
the
case
of
federal
property
for
which
payments
are
made
in
lieu
of
taxes
in
amounts
equivalent
to
taxes
which
might
otherwise
be
a
lawfully
assessed.
those
provisions
appear
i
believe
in
section
1
of
act
189.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
189.
mr.
roger
p.
o'connor
i
would
say
this,
if
your
honor
please?
as
we
know
and
as
government
counsel
has
pointed
out,
section
6
of
the
military
leasing
act
of
1947
provides
for
the
taxation
of
the
lessee's
interest,
as
far
as
local
taxing
agencies
are
concerned.
now,
i
think
we
would
have
that
right
regardless
of
that
provision,
but
we
say
here,
we
are
not
taxing
the
lessee's
interest.
if
we
tax
the
lessee's
interest,
then
we
would,
under
the
language
in
the
allegheny
case,
be
required
to
evaluate
the
lessee's
interest
in
property
in
accordance
with
regularly
accepted
methods
of
appraisal
such
as
taking
into
consideration
then
term
of
the
lease,
the
termination
provisions
in
the
lease,
the
amount
of
rent
and
so
forth.
now
we
obviously
didn't
do
that.
we
based
this
tax
upon
the
true
cash
value
of
the
property.
furthermore,
if
we
were
to
tax
the
lessee's
interest,
rather
than
the
privilege
of
using
the
property,
the
legislature
could
never
have
accomplished
the
result
intended,
namely
to
eliminate
a
discrimination
between
lessees
of
private
and
public
property
and
put
them
on
an
equal
footing
for
the
reason
that,
the
lessee's
interest
would
only
amount
to
an
infinitesimal
part
of
the
money
that
can
be
received
in
the
fashion
the
legislature
tax
provided
in
this
act.
now
as
i
say
the
legislature
could
have
imposed
a
much
larger
sum.
the
fact
that
it
is
equal
to
the
tax
on
the
property,
does
not
make
it
a
tax
on
the
property
because
again
as
i
say,
a
specific
tax
and
of
course
a
specific
tax
as
your
honors
know
is
nothing
but
an
excise
tax
and
examples
of
which
are
occupation
taxes,
privilege
taxes
and
license
taxes.
those
taxes
were
placed
upon
the
lessee's
use
of
the
property
in
connection
with
business
conducted
for
profit,
to
put
the
lessees
on
an
equal
basis,
lessees
of
private
or
public
property.
for
example,
corporation
a
coming
into
the
state
of
michigan
desires
to
lease
property,
defines
that
i
have
a
parcel
of
real
estate,
a
private
person,
and
it
finds
the
government
has
a
parcel
of
real
estate.
both
parcels
meet
their
specifications
to
perfection,
which
parcel
will
this
corporation
rent,
certainly
not
mine
because
they
know
if
they
rent
mine,
they
are
going
to
have
to
pay
taxes
either
in
the
amount
of
the
rent
charged
or
in
addition
to
the
rent
charged
in
consideration
over
reduction
in
that
rent
and
in
that
respect
it's
very
discriminatory
and
it
was
that
very
thing
that
the
legislature
sought
to
eliminate
in
passing
this
act.
now
flint
versus
stone
tracy
was
a
situation
where
the
federal
government
sought
to
tax
franchises
of
corporations
in
various
states
based
upon
and
measured
by
the
income
of
the
corporation,
including
municipally
tax
exempt
bonds.
now
the
federal
government
did
not
grant
those
franchises.
if
the
federal
government
can
do
that
in
connection
with
state
franchises
not
granted
by
it,
then
certainly
the
states
ought
to
be
able
to
tax
a
privilege
of
using
which
arises
out
of
an
instrument
namely
the
lease
of
the
federal
government.
the
fact
that
the
privilege
of
using
the
property
is
exercised
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
michigan
is
sufficient
in
and
of
itself
alone
to
permit
the
state
to
tax,
and
i
have
covered
that
point
in
my
brief
wherein
i
say
in
connection
with
home
insurance
company
case
which
quotes
from
savings
versus
(inaudible)
nothing
can
be
more
certain
in
legal
decision
and
that
the
privileges
and
franchises
of
a
private
corporation
of
all
trades
and
avocations
by
which
the
citizens
acquire
a
livelihood
maybe
taxed
by
a
state
for
the
support
of
the
state
government.
authority
to
that
affect
resides
in
the
state
independent
of
the
federal
government
and
is
wholly
unaffected
by
the
fact
that
the
corporation
or
individual
has
or
has
not
made
an
investment
in
federal
securities.
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
raise,
counsel
for
the
government
refers
the
senate
committee
hearings
and
refers
to
section
6
of
the
military
leasing
act,
we
say
it
does
not
apply
because
we
are
not
taxing
the
lessee's
interest.
the
military
leasing
act
does
not
prohibit
the
taxing
of
a
privilege
of
using
the
property.
there
was
no
discussions
in
the
senate
committee
hearings
in
connections
with
the
privilege
of
using
the
property
and
while
the
army
and
navy
as
i
gather
from
a
reading
of
the
senate
report,
were
both
interested
in
seeing
that
properties
leased
by
the
government
for
commercial
purposes
should
be
taxed
in
order
to
eliminate
that
discrimination
that
was
ever
present
between
public
and
private
lessees,
they
were
not
able
to
arrive
at
any
legal
basis
for
doing
it.
as
one
of
the
senators
i
recall
said,
when
it
was
suggested
that
you
transfer
title
of
the
government
to
the
lessee
during
the
term
of
the
lease,
one
of
the
senators
said
i
don't
think
that
would
be
constitutional
because
you
cannot
place
ownership
in
a
person
that
actually
doesn't
own
the
property
by
a
congressional
act,
therefore
they
forgot
it,
decided
to
leave
it
to
general
legislation
but
as
a
last
measure
passed
section
6
of
the
military
leasing
act
which
only
infinitesimally
helps
in
the
situation
to
avoid
discrimination.
it
doesn't,
because
you
don't
get
the
same
results
as
you
would
from
a
lessee
of
private
property.
i
see
my
time
is
up
if
your
honors
please,
mr.
street
will
finish.
