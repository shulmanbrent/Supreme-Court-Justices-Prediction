mr.
perry
w.
morton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
condemnation
case.
the
central
and
we
think
the
determinative
issue
is,
"when
did
the
taking
occur?
did
it
occur
as
the
government
insists?
when
the
united
states
took
actual
physical
possession
shortly
after
the
filing
of
the
case
under
an
order
of
possession
entered
by
the
court,
or
did
it
occur
as
the
respondent
contends?
when
a
declaration
of
taking
was
filed
with
the
payment
they
deposit,
approximately
three
years
later.
the
controversy
which
presents
this
basic
issue
here
for
a
review
arises
because
the
respondent
is
an
intermediate
purchaser
of
the
land
through
which
ran
the
perpetual
pipe-line
easement
taken
by
the
government
and
the
case
thus,
involves
an
application
of
the
familiar
anti-assignment
act.
the
facts
which
are
not
materially
in
dispute
maybe
briefly
summarized
as
follows,
the
case
started
in
march
of
1943
when
the
united
states
filed
its
petition
to
require
a
perpetual
right-of-way
or
a
pipe
line
or
petroleum
products
over
certain
lands
in
harris
county,
texas.
the
property
interest
involved
in
the
case
is
this
perpetual
easement
confined
to
a
strip,
33
feet
wide,
containing
about
2.7
acres
across
a
part
of
a
617-acre
farm
which
then
belonged
to
the
respondent's
predecessors
entitled.
an
order
of
possession
was
made
by
the
court
the
same
day,
and
within
10
days
thereafter,
the
government's
contractor,
exercising
the
easement,
went
into
actual
possession
and
started
the
construction
of
the
pipe
line
which
was
completed
and
which
has
been
in
use
ever
since
sometime
in
1943.
now,
somewhat
over
two
years
thereafter,
by
--
by
now
it
is
november
1945,
the
617-acre
farm
was
sold
to
the
respondent,
dow,
for
a
consideration
of
over
$200,000.
i
must
ask
your
indulgence
because
of
the
condition
of
my
throat.
the
deed
to
dow
accepted
certain
other
easements
and
then
it
recited,
"and
also
except
us
to
the
right-of-way
easements
and
the
condemnation
proceedings
here
and
after
mentioned.”
the
deed
later
states
that
it
is
expressly
agreed
that
it
is
"subject
to
the
existence
of
the
following
easement
and
proceedings."
and
item
d
of
the
list
which
follows
is
a
specific
identification
of
the
condemnation
case
according
to
its
caption
in
the
district
court
stage
by
reference
to
the
list
pendance
record.
in
may
of
1946,
and
i
think
this
is
now
about
seven
months
after
the
transfer,
the
government
filed
a
declaration
of
taking
under
the
act
of
1931.
an
estimated
compensation
was
deposited
therewith
and
a
judgment
was
entered
confirming
those
actions.
five
months
after
that
and
now
it
is
october
1946,
an
amendment
to
the
petition
was
made
to
name
additional
parties
defendant
for
the
first
time
including
dow.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
in
november
of
1948.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
they
were
designated
as,
i
think,
a
party
by
the
name
of
bute
and
some
other
party,
both
of
them
had
died
and
their
interest
were
dropped
in
later.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
they
were
the
predecessors
entitled
of
the
respondent.
in
november
of
1948,
the
commissioners
appointed
under
the
old
texas
practice
before
the
federal
rules
to
determine
the
compensation,
made
an
award
of
$4450
for
the
easement
involved
in
this
case
after
a
hearing
at
which
dow
appeared,
presented
evidence
of
value.
no
notice
had
been
served
at
that
time
upon
dow's
grantors
and
they
did
not
appeal.
in
october
of
1949,
the
government
moved
to
set
aside
the
award
upon
the
ground
that
dow
had
no
interest
in
the
land
at
the
time
the
government
took
possession
in
1943.
and
therefore,
dow
was
not
entitled
to
receive
the
compensation.
this
motion
was
dropped
from
the
motion
calendar
without
prejudice
to
the
government's
right
to
bring
it
on
for
hearing
at
a
later
date.
it
was
not,
i
may
say,
withdrawn
as
to
certify
the
respondent.
in
1955,
this
is
now
quite
sometime
later,
this
motion
was
renewed
in
connection
with
the
government's
motion
for
a
summary
judgment,
dismissing
dow
as
a
defendant.
and
this
later
motion
was
granted
by
the
district
court
in
march
of
1956.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
cannot
answer
for
matters
which
i
am
not
personally
acquainted
with,
the
--
i
think
the
record
will
show
it
has
moved
reasonably
promptly
since
it
has
come
to
my
attention.
i
don't
know
what
took
place
before.
i
can
say
many
reasons
for
a
delay
or
a
time
emergency
and
things
of
that
sort.
delay
itself
however
is
not
a
factor
in
the
issue
involved
here
and
i
believe
that
it
has
the
argument
developed
so
you
will
see
that
both
the
government
has
what
its
set
out
to
take
and
the
parties
are
amply
protected
by
the
accrual
of
interest
upon
the
compensation
which
will
contemplate
the
award.
well,
have
i
answered
your
question,
sir?
the
court
shortly
after
this
ordered
granting
the
summary
judgment
against
dow
and
dismissing
him,
made
another
order
setting
aside
the
commissioner's
award
and
permitting
dow's
grantors
to
withdraw
a
disclaimer
which
they
had
previously
filed,
and
permitted
dow's
grantors
to
pursue
further
proceedings
which
the
court
directed
be
had
under
rule
71a.
any
progress
in
that
direction
has
however
been
precluded
by
dow's
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
decision
of
which
court
favorable
to
dow.
you
have
brought
here
for
a
review
upon
the
government's
petition.
well
now,
i
should
like
to
summarize
very
briefly
and
by
headline
only
at
this
point
the
points
which
i
shall
hope
to
reach
as
the
argument
develops.
first,
this
taking
was
accomplished
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
when
the
united
states
physically
took
possession
and
built
the
pipe
line
in
1943.
and
it
was
at
that
moment
that
the
claim
to
compensation
for
this
easement
arose
and
vested
in
those
who
were
the
grantors
of
the
--
who
were
the
owners
of
the
property
at
that
time.
the
basic
principles
of
eminent
domain
are
absolutely
the
same
whether
the
federal
power
is
exercised
by
means
of
physical
seizure
or
condemnation
proceedings
or
a
combination
of
both
or
otherwise.
physical
seizure
gives
rise
to
the
claim
for
compensation
whether
the
amount
is
determined
in
condemnation
proceedings
initiated
by
the
government
as
here
or
in
proceedings
brought
by
the
owner
under
the
tucker
act.
the
second
point
will
be
that
the
filing
of
the
declaration
of
taking
three
years
after
the
possession
had
been
taken.
did
not
destroy
the
existing
claim,
it
did
not
divest
that
which
had
already
vested.
it
did
not
change
the
nature
of
the
situation
at
all,
so
far
as
this
controversy
is
concerned.
thirdly,
the
rules
here
advocated
by
the
government
have
consequences
far
beyond
with
the
boundaries
of
this
particular
case.
and
our
only
--
the
rules
which
can
produce
fair
results
to
the
united
states
and
to
the
landowners
with
whom
it
has
to
deal
in
the
administration
of
its
very
considerable
land
acquisition
programs.
now,
i
wish
to
return
and
develop
my
first
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
much
of
the
confusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
due
to
the
failure
to
distinguish
between
a
taking
and
a
passage
of
title.
and
this
confusion
has
all
wrapped
up
inside
of
it,
a
failure
to
distinguish
between
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
on
the
one
hand
and
corresponding
but
different
provisions
of
the
constitutions
of
many
of
the
states
including
texas.
the
power
of
eminent
domain
does
not
rest
upon
any
expressed
constitutional
grant
but
rather
as
a
basic
attribute
of
sovereignty.
the
fifth
amendment
merely
limits
the
exercise
of
that
problem
to
the
extent
that
it
requires
the
payment
of
just
compensation.
however,
it
does
not
require
as
many
state
constitutions
require
that
the
compensation
be
paid
in
advance
or
contemporaneously
with
the
taking.
and
so,
when
the
federal
government
physically
occupies
property
in
connection
with
unauthorized
project
or
program,
its
action
is
a
taking
and
it
is
not
a
tort
or
a
trespass.
if
the
government
has
not
initiated
its
own
condemnation
proceedings
as
it
did
here
in
which
the
compensation
may
ultimately
be
determined,
the
sooner
the
better
it
will
suit
me.
the
landowner
nevertheless
has
his
adequate
remedy
to
obtain
compensation
for
the
taking
by
bringing
his
own
case
against
the
government
under
the
tucker
act.
and
consequently,
unauthorized
taking
cannot
be
prevented
by
injunction
nor
can
trespass
damages
be
recovered
against
the
government,
its
officers
or
its
agents.
now,
differing
very
much
from
this
are
the
constitutions
of
the
so-called
first-pay
states
such
as
texas
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
first
pay.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
those
first
pay
constitutions
mean
in
effect
that
the
state
power
of
eminent
domain
or
in
the
case
of
its
subdivisions
or
utilities,
the
state-given
power
of
eminent
domain
can
be
exercised
only
through
the
medium
of
condemnation
proceedings.
indeed,
under
such
constitutions,
there
could
be
no
such
thing
as
the
tucker
act
and
any
physical
seizure
of
or
damage
to
property
prior
to
the
payment
of
compensation
or
in
some
states,
prior
to
the
giving
of
the
security
for
payment,
constitutes
a
trespass,
a
tort
and
not
a
taking.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no,
absolutely
not.
now,
i
interrupt
myself
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
pardon
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no,
the
state
has
it.
i
--
i
hope
i
had
made
that
clear,
mr.
justice,
that
it
is
an
inherent
power
sovereignty.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
is
a
matter
of
political
necessity.
it
has
existed
from
time
immemorial.
the
question
is
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
how
does
the
constitution
limit
upon
the
state
that
exercises
that
power
by
requiring
the
payment
of
compensation
in
advance
of
a
taking
or
contemporaneously.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
makes
a
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
makes
a
--
decide
a
difference
in
--
in
the
question
of
when
the
claim
arises
because
of
a
taking
which
is
the
material
with
which
his
case
deals.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
pardon
me,
mr.
justice?
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
i
hope
that
we
can
arrive
at
that
point
very
soon,
mr.
justice.
we're
interested
in
it
because
if
the
claim
existed
in
the
respondent's
grantors,
it
couldn't
--
it
couldn't
be
transplanted
somehow
to
somebody
else
later
on
without
some
operation
of
an
assignment
which
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
anti-assignment
act.
that
is
our
point.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
there
is
a
considerable
body
of
law
under
the
first-pay
constitutions
of
the
states,
mr.
justice,
which
call
everything
that
takes
place
before
payment.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
they
trespass,
yes,
and
not
a
taking.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
because
the
taking
is
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
until
you
actually
pay.
it
is
a
trespass
or
some
of
the
constitutions
as
i
think
i
remembered
to
mention,
provide
for
the
giving
of
security
for
payment
to
be
deposited
in
court.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
mr.
justice,
if
you
start
with
the
premise
that
i
think
your
first
question
involved
that
the
power
exists
as
an
inherent
power.
and
imagine
that
as
existing
to
all
of
its
full
consequences
subject
to
such
provisions
as
the
people
by
their
constitutions
have
provided
it
shall
be
limited
by.
then
those
words
of
limitation
become
extremely
important
in
determining
whether
there
has
been
a
taking
or
what
the
legal
consequence
of
some
physical
act
of
a
governmental
body
or
subdivisions
is.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that's
right.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
can
answer
that
as
assistant
attorney
general
outside
this
record.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
would
say
that's
in
probably
80%
of
our
28,000
such
matters.
we
eventually
file
a
declaration
of
taking
which
involves
the
deposit
of
the
money
as
a
condition
of
compliance
with
the
act
of
1931
which
gives
rise
to
this
procedure.
that
procedure
however
as
i
will
come
to
at
the
later
section
is
not
an
independent
procedure,
it
is
an
ancillary
procedure,
they're
must
already
be
pending
or
filed
at
that
same
moment,
a
condemnation
case.
the
declaration
of
taking
is
not
a
case,
it
is
a
proceeding
within
a
case.
and
under
--
until
that
provision
of
law,
1931,
say
for
various
earlier
piecemeal
provisions
about
authority
to
take
possession
and
things
of
that
sort
by
--
such
as
the
first
and
second
war
powers
acts,
labor
act
and
flood
control
provisions.
the
--
the
real
monuments
of
our
condemnation
settlement
are
the
act
of
1888
as
amended
in
something
like
that,
and
this
1931
act,
the
declaration
of
taking
act.
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that
a
little
later
on
somewhat
more
elaborately.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
certainly.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
seaboard
case
of
course
is
the
landmark
on
that
taking,
starts
to
carry
interest
from
the
moment
of
the
taking.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that
will
be
one
of
my
points,
your
honor.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
from
the
moment
that
there
has
been
such
a
taking
as
possession
represents
whatever,
there's
sometimes
a
fuzzy
feel
as
to
whether
there
has
been
a
taking.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
should
--
should
qualify
my
categorical
answer
about
using
the
word
“interest”.
i
think
the
rule
is
that
the
best
major
we've
been
able
to
figure
out
sort
--
so
far
is
interest.
but
actually,
it
is
a
part
of
just
compensation
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
for
which
interest
is
the
major
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
generally
accepted.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
at
the
time
of
the
taking
whenever
the
taking
is
complete.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
time
--
under
the
tucker
act,
it
is
the
accomplished
possession
which
is
the
taking.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
within
10
days,
the
record
shows.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
think
that
will
show
you
some
very
peculiar
consequences
of
this
case
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
before
we
finish
right
in
that
connection.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that
reminds
you
of
dickinson.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
i
think
i
was
indicating
what
i
conceive
to
be
and
what
i
believe
you
will
find
to
be,
a
very
substantial
difference
between
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
constitutions
of
these
first-pay
states.
now,
right
at
that
point,
i
wanted
to
interrupt
myself
long
enough
to
say
in
that
connection
that
it
is
this
very
basic
point
which
completely
distinguishes
all
of
the
state
court
cases
referred
to
on
page
8
of
the
respondent
's
brief
just
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that
is
one
of
them.
it
is
one
of
them,
although
the
point
is
much
more
substantive
than
that,
yes.
all
of
those
cases
came
from
first-pay
states.
in
the
two
texas
cases
for
example,
the
railroad
companies
which
had
gone
into
possession
were
considered
as
trespassers,
it
plainly
says
so.
and
in
all
of
the
other
six
cases
cited
by
the
respondent
under
that
subdivision
of
its
brief
--
of
his
brief,
contrary
to
the
indication
of
the
sentence
which
precedes
the
citations
which
indicates
that
possession
had
been
taken.
an
examination
of
the
facts
as
stated
in
the
opinions
will
show
that
the
possession
had
not
been
taken,
so
there
are
two
reasons.
first,
they
were
first-pay
states
and
secondly,
possession
hadn't
been
taken
anyway
so
what
of
it?
now,
it
is
true
of
course
that
there
are
many
cases
in
which
there
is
the
threshold
question
whether
in
fact
a
taking
has
occurred,
and
also
many
cases
even
some
condemnation
cases
as
well
as
tucker
act
cases
in
which
the
court
as
a
matter
of
fact,
may
have
to
determine
whether
that
has
been
not
only
a
taking
but
the
duration
or
the
extent
of
it.
i
hasten
to
say
that
this
case
is
not
plagued
with
those
questions
because
the
united
states
unquestionably
as
a
physical
fact
did
take
the
perpetual
easement
involved
in
the
case.
but
i
mentioned
these
fuzzy
cases
only
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
distinction
and
focusing
attention
upon
the
definiteness
of
what
has
taken
place
here.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
there
are
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
there
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
is
--
i
--
i
hope
i
have
not
taken
the
wrong
implication
of
your
word
“maneuver”.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes.
well,
we
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
have
a
great
many
reasons,
mr.
justice.
in
the
first
place,
many
times
a
project
area
will
be
announced
and
one
of
the
important
things
is
to
settle
the
project
limits
to
avoid
trafficking
in
land.
so
we
will
file
on
rather
incomplete
title
evidence
a
case
which
at
least
describes
the
area
to
fix
the
limits
of
the
project.
it
take
sometimes
a
great
time
than
in
some
places
longer
than
others
to
assemble
the
accurate
title
evidence
which
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
preparation
of
a
correct
declaration
of
taking.
the
declaration
of
taking
act,
as
i'll
also
point
out
a
little
later,
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
deposit
of
estimated
compensation
and
you
cannot
make
a
good
faith
estimate
of
compensation
without
an
appraisal.
and
in
many
of
these
cases,
we
have
no
appraisals
until
much
later.
there
are
these
necessary
gaps
between
the
commencement
of
a
case,
sometimes
--
especially
in
war
time
for
--
to
which
our
proceedings
have
to
be
geared
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
is
of
tremendous
importance
to
move
in
and
take
possession
of
a
place
right
away,
it
has
to
be
done
fast.
and
these
other
things
come
along
as
soon
as
they
can
possibly
be
ironed
out.
well,
i
think
i
was
pointing
out
the
definiteness
of
what
we
have
here,
there
are
some
of
these
fuzzy
cases.
cosby,
do
you
remember
the
flight
of
aircraft?
but
even
there,
you
remanded
the
case
to
the
court
of
claims
to
determine
the
duration
and
the
extent
of
what
the
government
had
taken.
dickinson,
another
example.
i
mentioned
it
a
moment
ago,
the
flooding
of
dickinson's
property.
when
was
it
completed?
it
took
two
years
to
backup
the
water
behind
the
dam.
the
statute
of
limitations
would
apply
in
one
case
but
not
in
the
other.
well,
you
held
that
the
statute
didn't
begin
to
run
until
the
situation
was
stabilized
as
to
the
physical
facts.
but
i
repeat
that
those
problems
are
not
present
here.
the
government's
taking
was
completed
as
an
indisputable
physical
fact
in
1943.
well,
over
two
years
before
dow
acquired
any
interest
whatever
in
the
property.
what
he
bought
and
what
he
paid
for
in
1945
was
the
pretty
simple
title
to
617
acres
of
land
already
burdened
with
various
easements
including
this
one.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
certainly,
after
the
declaration
of
taking,
that's
one
of
the
purposes
of
it.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
not
before.
there
was
no
provision
for
that.
now,
under
well-established
principles,
pardon
me.
under
well-established
principles
of
federal
eminent
domain
and
under
that
clear
command
of
the
fifth
amendment,
the
claim
to
compensation
vested
in
those
who
were
the
owners
of
the
property
at
the
time
of
the
taking.
they
are
the
ones
that
i
think
are
entitled
to
have
it
and
i
considered
my
job
to
get
it
to
them.
ideally,
as
chief
justice
shaw,
the
grand
old
chief
justice
of
massachusetts
in
1834
said,
"if
a
pie-powder
court
could
be
called
on
the
instant
and
on
the
spot,
the
true
rule
of
justice
for
the
public
would
be
to
pay
the
compensation
with
one
hand,
whilst
they
apply
the
axe
with
the
other."
but
obviously,
that
is
impossible
in
practice
as
the
great
chief
justice
recognized.
the
taking
itself
gives
rise
to
the
claim
for
compensation,
though
that
claim
still
has
to
be
determined
at
some
later
date
in
a
proper
form.
the
naked
legal
title
to
whatever
property
or
interest
in
property
is
taken
may
remain
until
the
claim
for
the
taking
is
satisfied
but
the
incident
of
the
passing
of
the
title
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
vesting
of
the
claim
which
takes
place
when
the
taking
does.
now
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
we
don't
think
so.
the
court
of
appeals
or
--
or
the
whole
bottom
of
our
argument
is
that
that,
it
is
the
physical
fact
being
stabilized
to
which
dickinson
was
addressed.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
certainly.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
we
have
filed
this
--
if
that
--
i
say
there
are
sometimes
fuzzy
cases.
but
this
--
this
case
was
filed
on
a
certain
date
and
order
of
possession
was
entered
that
date,
and
within
10
days,
we
started
to
build
this
pipe
line
and
we
finished
at
that
same
year
within
a
few
days.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
we
have
no
statute
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
judge
with
a
cf
kind
of
a
citation
as
i
remembered,
who
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
u.s.-dickinson
in
reference
to
what
he
conceived
to
be
the
ambulatory
character
of
the
claim
until
the
declaration
of
taking
was
filed.
now,
what
i
am
trying
to
establish
is
plainly
this
that
there
was
nothing
ambulatory
about
the
claim.
the
claim
was
vested
at
the
time
we
completed
the
physical
acts
of
possession.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
claim
to
compensation,
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes,
but
it
could
not
have
dismissed
it's
obligation
to
pay
just
compensation.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
for
whatever
we
had,
mr.
justice.
for
whatever
we
had
by
that
time
taken.
of
course,
that
problem
is
present
in
any
tucker
act
case.
that
problem
is
present
in
any
case
where
a
declaration
taken
is
not
employed.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no,
no.
that
would
be
the
trespass
theory
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
not
the
taking
here.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
we
took
possession.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
and
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
--
the
way
in
which
i
would
conceive
that
which
i
don't
think
is
very
close
to
this
but
i'll
theorize
with
you
for
a
minute.
i
would
think
that
under
(inaudible),
is
it?
that
--
it
says,
“the
government
takes
whatever
it
eventually
is
determined
to
have
been
in
need
of.”
mr.
perry
w.
morton
and
by
moving
out
later
--
may
i?
mr.
perry
w.
morton
by
moving
out
later,
that
presumably
establishes
what
it
was
in
need
of.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
but
that
taking
occurred
back
here
at
the
beginning
and
created
a
claim
which
was
then
vested
and
it
was
not
different
in
kind.
it
was
still
a
taking,
it
was
only
different
in
extent
the
same
way
that
you
might
dismiss
a
fee
title
after
three
months,
but
i
mean
--
where
you
start
to
take
a
fee
title.
but
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
--
it
was
reduced
to
whatever
it
was
determined
the
government
in
fact
needed.
but
as
i
should
point
out,
that
problem
was
present
in
cosby,
that
problem
is
present
in
any
case.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
and
you
can't
try
taking
cases
on
some
theory
that
you're
going
to
have
to
try
a
new
one
each
day
for
every
progression
of
--
of
the
future.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
definitive
decision
of
this
court
on
this
point.
i
am
trying
to
reason
from
all
of
the
principles
that
i
think
i
have
collected
in
my
head
that
i
hope
will
be
helpful
to
as
to
what
our
original
intention
was.
i
would
point
out
on
page
6
of
the
record
that
the
estate
which
we
described
and
which
we
in
fact
today
had.
this
is
the
bottom
of
page
6.
that
the
interest
sought
to
be
acquired
by
the
petitioner
in
the
foregoing
tracts
of
land,
is
a
perpetual
right-of-way
for
the
construction,
operation,
maintenance,
patrol,
repair
and
replacement
of
a
pipe
line
or
pipe
lines
or
the
transportation
of
petroleum
products
or
any
other
material
or
substance
and
so
forth,
a
perpetual
easement
for
a
right-of-way
for
a
pipe
line.
that
is
what
we
started
out
to
take.
that
is
what
we
have.
that
is
what
we
have
to
pay.
now,
under
well-established
groups
of
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
if
we
had
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
oh,
no.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no,
no,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
could
not
agree
to
that
because
i
say
they
had
a
claim
the
moment
of
taking.
and
we
could
have
tried
the
case
the
next
day.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
and
we
would
have
been
bound
for
a
perpetual
easement
according
to
our
complaint.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
most
assuredly,
they
could
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
we
admit
to
the
ambulatory
character
of
the
proceeding
until
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
until
the
declaration
of
taking
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
saved
for
the
fact
that
rights
were
fixed
by
the
taking
itself,
whatever
they
were.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
now
let
me
figure
that
one
out.
i
don't
--
not
sure
i
follow
that,
mr.
justice.
i
answered
that
they
could
bring
suit
the
next
day
under
the
tucker
act
if
there
had
been
physical
facts
completed
which
would
have
avail
--
accomplished
to
take
it.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
as
there
was
here.
i
don't
see
how
that
is
the
least
inconsistent
with
my
differentiation
which
i
insist
is
important
between
the
first
pay
proposition
and
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
think
i
see
your
point
now.
i'm
not
altogether
sure.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
--
the
point
is
that
under
the
first
pay
constitutions,
the
state
itself
except
as
it
may
be
otherwise
provided.
i
think
texas
draws
a
line
between
the
state
and
its
subdivisions
and
public
utilities.
but
under
those
state
constitutions
that
i
am
talking
about
and
generally
labeling
as
first-pay
states,
they
can't
even
move
into
possession.
so
there
simply
couldn't
be
a
physical
act
of
possession.
they
go
in,
it's
a
wrongful
act
and
not
a
rightful
act.
now,
if
this
weren't
true,
we'd
have
to
make
scrap
of
a
whole
draft
of
basic
principles
of
federal
eminent
domain
law.
it
is
for
example
because
of
this
basic
concept
that
the
valuation
of
property
always
has
reference
to
the
date
of
taking,
not
earlier
and
not
later.
it
is
also
because
of
this
that
the
just
compensation
includes
not
only
the
value
of
the
property
at
the
time
of
the
taking,
but
an
additional
sum
usually
measured
as
interest
as
in
the
seaboard
case
that
i
mentioned
a
while
ago.
it
is
also
because
of
this
basic
concept
that
the
owner
at
the
time
of
the
taking.
and
as
danforth
said,
“not
the
owner
at
an
earlier
or
later
date,
receives
the
payment.”
now,
these
very
specific
results
flow
not
out
of
some
so-called
equitable
rule
as
supposed
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals.
they
flow
rather
out
of
that
great
body
of
federal
constitutional
law
bottomed
upon
the
fifth
amendment.
this
great
body
of
law
revolves
around
two
basic
substantive
rights.
one
of
these
is
the
governmental
right
to
seize
and
use
property
for
any
lawful
for
public
purpose
and
the
other
is
the
property
owner's
constitutional
right
guaranteed
by
the
fifth
amendment.
and
that
means
the
property
owner
at
the
time
of
the
taking
to
receive
just
compensation.
these
two
substantive
rights
are
the
same
whether
the
procedure
employed
for
the
determination
of
compensation
happens
to
be
a
condemnation
case
brought
by
the
government
as
here
or
a
tucker
act
case
brought
by
the
property
owner.
now,
we
can't
do
business
on
a
double
standard
and
that's
one
of
our
problems.
now,
i
turn
to
a
consideration
hastily.
i
should
like
to
save
some
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
now,
the
declaration
of
taking
act
of
1931,
which
the
court
of
appeals
misconceived
to
be
the
hinge
upon
which
this
controversy
turns.
you
will
find
the
relevant
portions
of
it
in
our
brief
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
4
and
over
to
the
top
of
page
6.
in
a
nutshell,
all
i
have
time
for,
the
act
provides
that
when
the
government
brings
a
condemnation
case
or
at
any
later
time
before
judgment,
it
may
at
its
option
file
a
declaration
of
taking
and
file
a
deposit
therewith
and
make
a
deposit
therewith
of
a
sum
estimated
to
be
just
compensation.
and
that
--
at
that
time,
the
title
passes
to
the
united
states
of
whatever
interest
it
has
described.
thereafter,
any
deficiency
as
between
the
amount
of
the
deposit
and
the
amount
later
determined
to
be
just
compensation
as
of
the
time
of
the
taking,
draws
interest
at
6%.
on
proper
application,
the
court
may
order
the
deposited
funds
distributed
to
the
persons
entitled
and
may
make
any
necessary
orders
respecting
possession.
now,
i
invite
and
this
time
i
do
have
to
read,
your
particular
attention
to
section
4,
beginning
near
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
the
government's
brief
which
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
overlooked.
i
read,
“the
right
to
take
possession
and
title
in
advance
of
final
judgment
in
condemnation
proceedings
as
provided
in
this
act
shall
be
in
addition
to
any
right,
power
or
authority
conferred
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
shall
not
be
construed
as
abrogating,”
i
skipped
a
little
piece,
“as
abrogating
limiting
or
modifying
any
such
right,
power
or
authority.”
now,
by
these
very
terms
then,
the
1931
act
provides
merely
an
ancillary
remedy
as
i
said
to
you,
mr.
justice
black.
at
the
option
of
the
government
within
the
framework
of
a
condemnation
case
which
has
to
find
its
authority
in
some
other
act,
usually
the
old
1888
act.
my
point
is
that
the
declaration
of
taking
does
not
stand
on
its
own
feet.
no
condemnation
case
can
be
commenced
under
it
alone
for
an
authoritative
treatment
of
the
objectives
and
operation
of
this
act,
i
refer
to
the
great
opinion
of
this
court
in
miller.
i
summarized
briefly
from
that
case
that
the
purposes
were
two-fold.
on
the
one
hand,
it
relieves
the
government
of
the
burden
of
interest
accruing
on
the
sum
which
has
been
deposited
from
the
date
of
the
deposit
to
the
date
of
the
judgment,
and
on
the
other
hand,
it
gives
the
former
owner
if
his
title
is
clear,
immediate
cash
compensation
to
the
extent
of
the
government's
declared
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
property.
and
so
here,
the
filing
of
the
declaration
of
taking
simply
made
the
deposit
available
to
the
former
owners
and
reduced
to
that
extent,
the
government's
interest
liability.
well
now,
i
want
to
combine
hastily
at
this
point
my
first
and
my
second
points.
the
taking
of
all
that
the
government
set
out
to
take
and
all
that
it
has
ever
taken
in
this
case
was
completed
in
1943
when
it
exercised
its
perpetual
easement
by
physical
appropriation.
the
right
to
compensation
then
vested
in
those
who
owned
the
property
at
that
time.
the
declaration
of
taking
did
not
change
the
nature
of
the
taking
which
had
already
occurred.
and
a
necessarily
corollary
of
this
is
that
it
did
not
and
could
not
divest
or
transplant
the
right
to
compensation
which
had
already
become
vested
in
those
guarantors
by
the
operation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
by
the
very
terms
of
the
1931
act,
it
does
not
abrogate,
limit
or
modify
any
other
right
and
that
is
as
true
of
the
landowner
as
it
is
of
the
united
states,
it
is
been
so
held
and
kept.
now,
for
a
few
words
about
the
anti-assignment
act
and
i
must
rush
on.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
hope
so.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
will
describe
i
hope
some
of
the
consequences.
i
won't
have
time
for
many
of
them,
but
there
are
many
consequences
of
this.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
there
is
a
specific
consequence
of
that
direction.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
with
reference
to
dow,
if
i
may
come
to
that
point
now.
if
dow's
--
if
the
summary
judgment
dismissing
dow
from
the
case
according
to
the
district
court
is
reinstated
by
this
court,
of
course
he
gets
nothing.
but
we
insist
that
his
landowner,
that
his
predecessors
entitled
are
the
ones
entitled
to
this
compensation.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
--
the
point
is
that
we
feel
under
some
obligation
to
pay
the
right
people.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
anti-assignment
act
stands
in
the
way
of
that
conveyance.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
but
that
was
--
yes.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
mr.
justice
black
i
can't
answer
for
the
situation
as
between
those
two
parties.
the
consequence
to
the
government
may
actually
be
this.
respondent's
counsel
has
suggested
that
we
have
some
purpose
here
to
defeat
any
claim
for
compensation.
i
repudiate
that
as
an
unworthy
and
unwarranted
suggestion.
the
real
truth
is,
and
i
stand
here
in
the
very
unique
position
of
saying
this
that
if
the
government
wins
this
case,
it
will
probably
have
to
pay
more
than
if
it
loses.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
on
the
theory
of
the
court
of
--
of
the
court
of
appeals,
if
a
taking
did
not
occur
until
1946
that
is
the
first
state
when
interest
begins.
the
government
insists
that
interest
begins
as
of
1943.
now,
that
is
one
consequence.
i
have
several
more
that
i
should
like
to
hasten
through.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
sometimes
it
goes
down.
the
government,
if
it
were
so
minded
evilly
could
manipulate
transactions
to
take
advantage
of
whatever
particular
market
suited
it
the
best.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that's
one
of
the
reasons
for
this
stretch
between
when
we
file
a
complaint
and
when
we
file
a
declaration
of
taking.
here
are
some
others,
i'll
hasten
through
them.
you're
acquainted
with
the
severance
damage
cases.
suppose
if
this
situation
in
here
was
a
three-year
hiatus
and
someone
having
a
nearly
adjoining
tract
decided
that
it'd
be
an
awful
good
time
to
buy
this
tract
over
here.
you
can
see
how
irreadily
a
severance
damage
claim
could
be
created
against
the
government
by
the
assembly
of
a
plottage.
another
one.
suppose
that
--
well,
first
of
all
i
have
to
say
it's
a
well
known
rule
and
i
don't
think
anyone
would
dispute
as
a
rule
of
appraisal
that
a
large
plottages
frequently
are
worth
more
than
the
sum
of
the
--
of
the
several
parts
of
the
plottage.
and
so,
owners
of
--
of
all
of
these
several
little
fragments
could
very
readily
if
there
were
this
hiatus
between
the
two
--
gather
together
their
claims,
assemble
them
into
a
fine
plottage
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
miller
case
has
been
pretty
well
knocked
into
a
cocked
hat
but
if
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
stands
up,
that's
one
of
my
points.
the
question
is
whether
this
is
the
law
or
the
miller
case
is
the
law,
in
basic
reasoning,
mr.
justice.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
there
are
several.
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
respondent
makes
some
point
of
that
but
i
think
the
point
is
merely
that
it
is
the
law
of
texas
which
gives
force
to
his
deed
but
of
course
that
would
be
true
of
practically
any
assignment
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
which
would
read
away
this
anti-assignment
act
completely.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
of
course,
that
was
precisely
the
situation
you
dealt
with
in
shannon.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
i
think
that
was
a
purely
formal
distinction.
there
was
a
transfer
of
title
to
the
real
estate
and
it
had
been
damaged
by
some
army
troops
as
i
recall
the
case.
and
sometime
after
the
--
after
the
event,
the
transfer
of
title
took
place
and
the
--
who
was
it
--
shannon
was
the
grantee
as
i
recall
it,
brought
suits
in
the
--
what
was
it,
the
court
of
claims?
in
the
district
court,
that
was
within
those
limits.
and
it
came
up
here
and
some
point
was
made
in
--
in
the
several
opinions
filed
of
the
fact
that
the
--
that
all
parties
were
there
and
the
government
wouldn't
get
hurt.
but
the
majority
opinion
said
that
that's
not
--
was
not
the
basis
upon
which
the
anti-assignment
act
was
to
be
judged.
and
that
the
anti-assignment
act
made
it
completely
void
and
it
made
no
difference
with
the
other
people
who
were
present.
well
now,
let
me
take
inventory.
of
course,
we
have
here
to
deal
with
many
other
consequences,
i
wish
i
could
state
them
all
to
you.
one
of
the
most
important
things
about
the
date
of
taking
is
that
it
establishes
the
condition
of
the
property
as
to
which
it
is
to
be
valued
and
that
means
not
only
the
title
condition
but
the
physical
condition
of
the
property.
i
believe
that
the
certainty
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
reaching
for,
it
did
not
find
and
that
instead,
it
opened
a
“pandora's
box”
of
complete
confusion.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
may
i
ask,
mr.
chief
justice,
how
much
time
i
have?
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
i
think
maybe
about
four
minutes.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
counsel,
but
i
hope
not
this
court
--
were
and
are
confused
by
the
difference
between
the
taking
and
the
title
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
pardon
me,
my
throat
just
won't
let
me
talk.
i
say
i
think
the
court
below
and
opposing
counsel
still
confound
the
distinction
which
i
think
is
absolutely
essential
between
the
taking
and
the
title.
that
to
me
is
the
--
is
the
real
hand
share
even
when
a
declaration
of
taking
is
filed.
the
title
remains
defeasible
if
payment
isn't
made.
of
course
title
never
finally
and
conclusively
and
irrevocably
passes
until
payment
is
made.
the
title
passes
within
the
statutory
terms
when
a
declaration
of
taking
is
filed.
well,
this
cherokee
nation
case
that
has
been
so
much
mentioned
on
this
issue
whether
a
taking
occurred
only
when
title
passed.
i
wish
i
had
the
book
here
but
my
memory
of
the
case
is
this.
that
the
point
the
court
was
making
in
context
was
plainly
that
until
payment
was
made.
title
was
reserved
as
a
sort
of
a
security
transaction,
a
sort
of
--
may
i
give
you
what
i
think
maybe
a
rough
analogy.
suppose
a
contract
of
sale
is
made,
a
real
estate
and
the
seller
allows
the
buyer
to
go
into
a
possession
on
a
certain
date,
maybe
immediate
possesson
and
retains
the
legal
title
as
security
for
the
payment
of
the
balance
of
the
purchased
price.
it
is
roughly
that
concept
in
cherokee
nation
for
reason
of
which,
with
i
think
language
that
was
unfortunate.
i'd
agree
thoroughly
with
cherokee
nation
except
for
a
few
unfortunate
words
which
i
don't
think
were
at
all
the
hinge
of
the
decision.
this
title
that
cherokee
talks
about
was
a
thing
which
was
just
sort
of
held
back
as
a
necessity
until
payment
was
finally
put
on
the
counter.
now,
i
would
go
back
to
the
great
words
of
the
chief
justice
if
we
could
pay,
if
it
were
practical,
if
it
were
possible
to
pay.
the
compensation
with
one
hand
and
apply
the
acts
with
the
other,
we
wouldn't
have
these
problems,
but
we
can't
do
that.
it
is
a
decidedly
different
thing
whether
these
principles
which
are
so
important
to
our
administration
of
this
land
acquisition
program
are
bottomed
upon
some
“equitable
rule”
such
as
referred
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
which
may
mean
one
thing
today
and
another
thing
tomorrow,
and
one
thing
here,
and
another
thing
that
--
or
whether
these
rights,
these
correlative
substantive
rights,
the
right
on
the
one
hand
of
the
government
to
take
and
the
right
on
the
other
hand
of
the
landowner
to
receive
that
just
compensation
which
the
constitution
says
he
shall
have.
that,
we
say
is
bottomed
upon
the
constitution
and
not
upon
some
changeable
concept
of
equitable
considerations
which
are
not
even
fully
described
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
suppose
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
suppose
that
--
well,
$50,000
i
think
wasn't
even
his
answer.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
think
it
was
--
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
would
be
my
answer
that
if
it
is
worth
$50,000
in
1943
that
is
what
the
--
that
is
when
the
taking
occurred
and
that
is
when
the
valuation
is
fixed.
everything
should
relate
to
the
date
of
taking,
interest,
valuation,
title
condition,
physical
condition,
everything
that
you
can
imagine.
but
i
think
his
answer
was
inconsistent
with
his
theory.
because
on
his
theory
that
no
taking
was
accomplished
until
1946,
the
valuation
should
be
$150,000,
or
if
the
market
was
going
in
the
other
direction,
the
answer
would
be
opposite.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice,
my
throat
condition
has
blocked
up
my
ears
as
well.
could
i
have
the
question
again?
mr.
perry
w.
morton
miller
case
is
a
landmark.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
miller,
is
--
is
authority
for
a
great
many
things.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
and
among
them
is
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
among
them
is
a
description
of
the
purposes
of
the
declaration
of
taking
act
as
i
have
described
them
in
my
opening.
another
one
is
that
evaluation
does
take
place
at
the
date
of
taking.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that's
right.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that
(inaudible)
as
the
bottom
of
the
miller
case.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no
that
is
why
i
think
that
my
answer
earlier
to,
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
whittaker,
was
just
plainly
that
an
affirmance
here
will
place
you
in
a
position
wholly
inconsistent
with
miller.
thank
you.
