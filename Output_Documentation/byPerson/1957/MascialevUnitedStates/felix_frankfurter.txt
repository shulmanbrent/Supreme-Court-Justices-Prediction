justice
felix
frankfurter
on
cross-examination,
was
defendant
asked
as
to
his
prior
purchases
or
addiction
to
narcotics?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
direct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
say
it
must
be
believed
a
minute
ago
that
the
jury
rejected
his
testimony.
the
just
had
disbelieved
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
the
statement
that
is
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
–
do
i
interpret
with
that
answer
that,
there
being
nothing
else,
there
being
no
other,
according
to
your
statement
of
the
fact,
there
being
nothing
in
the
record,
assuming
the
defendant
is
out
altogether,
there
being
nothing
in
the
record,
from
which
they
could
have
inferred,
reasonably
inferred,
his
prior
relation
to
narcotics,
they
couldn't
from
his
denial,
from
this
own
denial
have
drawn
an
affirmative
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
your
answer
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
finally
mr.
clark,
finally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
evidence
of
ready
knowledge
on
his
part?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
spelling
out
in
more
particularity,
the
first
approach
by
the
government
agent
was
in
january
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
that
time
you
say,
is
there
any
evidence
that
at
that
time
the
petitioner
here
had
any
kind
of
relations,
never
mind
how
close,
had
any
kind
of
relations
with
the
source
of
the
supplier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
precise
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right!
what's
the
answer
to
the
next
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
now
creep
along
from
january
14
on
so
as
to
make
out
--
the
intent
of
my
question
is
clear
that
namely
is
what
generalization,
what
allowable
basis,
on
the
record,
what
allowable
basis
is
there
in
the
record
that
he
had
such
relations
that
he
wasn't
that
innocent
in
this
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
not
that
he
was
in
the
business
but
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
know
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
anything
on
cross-examination
upon
which
the
jury
could
have
inferred
that
his
disavows,
his
discrediting
disavows
for
cause,
i
mean,
in
this
field?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
quite
so
from
this
court,
but
you've
got
a
good
deal
of
material
in
the
second
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
you
say
standard.
i
notice
you
say
standard,
because
there
is
a
decisive
difference
between
the
(inaudible)
dissenters
might
get
at
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
think
that
makes
no
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
that
isn't
an
applied
exception
to
the
--
exception
to
the
substantive
law?
isn't
that
the
base
in
the
word,
isn't
that
the
majority
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yeah,
that
impliedly
it
isn't
a
crime
for
somebody
to
do
this
if
he
is
entrapped
into
doing
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
apply.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it's
a
defense,
but
he
hasn't
committed
any
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean,
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
clark?
suppose
the
government
were
to
concede
in
a
case,
not
this
case
at
the
most,
suppose
the
case
cleanly
on
its
facts
fit
that
a
government
agent
got
to
talking
with
a
fellow
in
a
bar
room
and
said
to
him,
how
he
did
it
to
make
substantial
money,
it
is
conceded
that
the
victim
as
i
should
call
him
so,
never
thought
about
that
before,
had
no
prior
knowledge,
but
suddenly
saw
opening
up
of
the
opportunity.
is
that
case
clearly
within
sorrells
and
not
a
case
of
entrapment
would
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
was
clear,
there
couldn't
be
any
controversy
about
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
in
this
case.
well,
you
say
it
is
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
take
my
case
in
which
there
is
no
question
of
when
he
knew
seifert
and
all
of
the
rest,
i
want
to
get
rid
of
everything
in
these
questions
i
put
to
you,
it's
disbelief
by
the
jury
of
too
selling
on
cross
conceded
but
the
fellow
never
thought
of
it
before
and
in
the
course
of
(inaudible)
opened
up,
well
that's
interesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
he
doesn't
immediately
accept
it,
he
doesn't,
but
it
is,
i
want
to
think
about
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
you
can
see,
the
government
agent
says
this
is
a
prospect
for
his
purposes
and
they
have
another
guy.
two
months
later
he
finally
says,
well,
it's
something
i
am
going
for.
but
that
would
be
a
clear
case
if
you
think
the
government
would
say
that
is
not
sorrells?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i
mean
would
it
be
arguable
that
that
is
not
within
the
sorrells
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
what
would
be
the
argument,
i
am
curious
to
know
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
you
to
see
what
the
case
i
put.
this
is
a
brand
new
world
that
we
have,
he
thinks
about
it
and
two
weeks
later
or
a
month
later
he
finally
engages
at
the
end
of
--
do
you
think
that's
arguably
is
not
covered
by
sorrells?
i
don't
know
what
would
be
covered
by
sorrels
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
think
your
case
is
this
--
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
charge
did
the
court
give?
what
kind
of
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
content
with
the
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
content
with
the
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
charge
got
submitted
to
proper
standards
of
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
way
you
say
the
case
shouldn't
have
been
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
charge?
in
the
sherman
case,
is
that
the
case
that
judge
learned
handled?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which,
there
were
two
sherman
cases,
i
remember.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
from
the
first
one
that
the
charge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
suppose
there
was
an
introduction.
suppose
if
this
is
clear,
but
after
that
there
was
an
introduction,
but
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
an
exposit
would
be
admitted
by
the
government
that
he
need
to
either
profited
by
or
dealt
with
it
or
anything
else,
but
that
having
talked
with
marshall
he
said
that,
well,
i
am
not
n
this
business,
but
i
know
some
people
who
are.
would
he
become
a
aider
and
abettor
or
a
coconspirator,
do
you
think?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
he
did
produce
the
man.
he
introduces,
i
know
this
fellow.
you
want
to
know
somebody
in
the
narcotics
business,
mr.
jones
is
in
the
narcotics
business.
that
would
make
him
a
coconspirator?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
it
make
him
a
coconspirator?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
fact
that
--
assume
this.
assume
that
he
had
no
prior
dealing
that
government
had
to
concede
that
this
fellow
had
no
prior
narcotics
connections
or
record,
but
in
the
world
in
which
he
moved
he
also
knew
people
where
in
the
narcotic
business
and
he
sat
down
with
a
government
agent
who
i
notice
almost
immediately
started
to
discuss.
i
don't
what
that
means.
there
is
the
fact
that
a
government
agent
sits
down
with
somebody
who
is
into
the
gambling
world
and
the
gambler
finds
his
talk
interesting
and
listens
to
him,
does
that
show
readiness
to
commit
crime,
willingness,
ready
and
willing?
what
is
ready
and
willing
mean?
he
does
not
say,
shut
up,
i
am
not
interesting
in
narcotics
and
i
do
not
want
listen
to
it.
i
know
the
supreme
court
cases
and
this
may
get
me
into
trouble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
that
i
ask
you
is
because
i
think
to
me
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
whether
you
are
to
imply
into
the
statute
a
limitation
by
congress
that
it
is
not
making
it
a
crime
for
a
man
who
does
not
shut
up
of
a
government
agent
who
talks
about
his
businesses.
says,
i
do
not
want
to
hear
about
it.
i
am
not
interested,
but
listens
to
what
might
be
very
interesting
tale
and
gets
interested
although
there
is
no
antecedent
proof
that
that
man
was
going
to
embark
upon
that
kind
of
business
except
by
the
enticement
of
an
agent
or
whether
you
take
the
view
of
justice
roberts'
concurring
opinion
that
this
is
shabby
business
for
the
government
to
do.
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
i
think
to
me
whether
this
is
an
implied
exception
in
the
statute
or
that
this
is
the
kind
of
a
thing
that
should
not
be
encouraged
by
having
the
government
go
in
the
business
of
having
people
commit
crimes
who
vouch
for
their
activity
when
they
are
committing
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
quite
right
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
this
being
a
criminal
case
so
that
the
reliance
of
the
usual
arguments
for
a
hearing
to
a
case
from
my
point
of
view
does
not
apply
applied
to
this.
what
i
want
to
know
is
rather
the
government
rests
on
the
assumptions
that
sorrells
case
--
the
problem
of
entrapment
is
concluded
by
the
theory
on
which
the
sorrells
case
was
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
am
suggesting
something
else
mr.
knapp.
i
am
suggesting
that
it
may
make
a
difference
whether
you
would
take
the
ground
on
which
the
court,
you
rightly
say
the
court,
i
prefer
to
say
a
court
instead
of
majority,
the
majority
makes
the
court,
what
you
take
the
ground
of
the
court
in
recognizing
entrapment
and
saving
a
defendant
or
of
the
court
or
that
you
take
the
view
of
the
robert's
view,
to
me
it
makes
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
think
that
from
that
conversation,
from
that
evidence
that
you
read
if
a
federal
judge
had
presided
in
this
case,
commented
on
the
fact
that
he
could
have
withdrawn
the
jury,
of
course
you
need
not
to,
(inaudible)
but
from
this
conversation,
do
i
to
infer
that
what's
his
name,
masciale
was
in
the
business
of
procuring
narcotics?
do
you
think
that
conversion
is
enough
basis
for
allowing
a
jury
to
deduce
that
this
man
was
in
the
business
of
trafficking
narcotics,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
said
it's
like
a
merchant
you
go
into
a
grocery
store
and
you
say
have
you
got
some
(inaudible)
he
says
i
happened
to
be
out
of
it
today,
but
i
will
get
you
this.
so
that's
just
like
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
say
that
in
this
conversation?
just
read
where
he
says
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
apparent
from
agent's
testimony
that
he
initiated
the
talk,
the
agent
initiated
the
talk?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there
is
evidence
that
marshall
had
reason
to
believe
that
this
man
who
was
a
–
was
a
violator
of
the
law
against
narcotics
and
this
is
really
a
mean
of
getting
evidence
to
establish
that
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
evidence
--
this
is
what
kowel
told
me,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
kowel
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
still
a
government
agent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
government
did
call
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
(inaudible)
we
are
only
getting
the
expenses
but
if
this
time
and
later
the
government
was
not
willing
to
tell
about
(inaudible)
narcotics,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
we
have
about
him
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
meetings
were
there
between
marshall
and
masciale
after
the
initial
meeting
on
january
14th?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
the
record
indicate
how
many
of
the
subsequent
meetings
face
to
face,
i
mean
marshall
and
masciale
or
as
masciale's
initiation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
there
is
any
doubt
that
he,
in
my
point
of
view
committed
his
crime,
but
in
the
doubt
of
(inaudible)
justify
that
(inaudible)
problems
in
any
cases,
otherwise,
there
wouldn't
be
any
problems
in
the
past,
the
question
is
who
--
who
started
the
problem.
i'd
like
to
know
if
the
record
shows
how
--
what
the
evidence
is,
that
after
the
january
14th
meeting
masciale
was
the
addressing
party
or
the
initiating
party
or
the
compelling
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
he
said,
after
the
january
14th
meeting,
the
next
meeting,
marshall
continued
to
be
acted;
he
was
the
propelling
cause,
wasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
went
after
him,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
he
initiated
the
talk,
he
got
him
interested
and
he
went
after
him
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
evidently
masciale
wasn't
so
ready
and
so
living
that
that
he
took
the
ball
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
is
suggesting
that
this
fellow
was
a
resisting
person
throughout
the
process
else
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
prosecution.
the
question
is
(inaudible)
as
i
understand
it.
my
point
of
view
is
how
whether
the
government
initiated,
and
how
compelling
it
was
to
get
the
people
considering
the
fact
they're
not
potential
criminals
to
add
to
the
list?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
he
thought
again
and
then
he
said
what
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
judge
–
did
the
judge
charge
the
jury
(inaudible)
give
the
court
any
guidance
about
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
mention
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
mean
that
kowel
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
kowel
that
meeting,
so
kowel
and
marshall,
kowel's
defendant
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
that
government
is
burdened
to
show
that
he
was
innocent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
a
burden
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
what
burden
means
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
you
say
that
the
question
isn't
–
that
the
jury
must
find
him
to
look
in
his
mind
and
i
think
for
the
mind
the
(inaudible)
and
they
could
find
that
as
a
matter
of
a
fact
he's
not
unwilling
to
push,
and
in
his
mind
he
was
ready
to
act
on
the
suggestion
by
the
government
that
by
the
entrapment,
look
at
this,
the
effect
of
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
you
do
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
clash
with
him
that
you
just
prove
entrapment
(inaudible)
the
jury
may
find
no
exception,
if
they
find
for
the
matter
of
the
fact,
that
the
mental
state
of
that
man
would
be
controlled
one
side,
but
(inaudible)
quite
to
say
management
involved
to
propose
that
(inaudible)
he
must
make
a
speech
or
manifest
opposition
and
this
is
the
method
to
be
in
practice
government
agent
take
the
initiation,
no
prior
evidence
that
the
man
wanted
to
(inaudible)
doesn't
disprove
that
the
government
really
thinks
it's
(inaudible)
that's
your
--.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
the
very
different
thing
from
saying
if
you
find
that
he's
seemed
already
at
(inaudible)
in
proper
proposition
during
the
returning
(inaudible)
that's
been
there
for
his
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
must
have
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
somebody
and
he
get
you
going,
get
you
going,
that's
what
your
position
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
went
out
