mr.
george
r.
nock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
five
years
ago,
last
month
the
director
of
corrections
in
california
adopted
a
new
regulation
regarding
prison
law
library.
it
was
in
response
to
a
certain
problem
he
faced.
in
two
of
the
three
institutions
under
his
control
there
were
few
or
any
law
books
at
all.
in
two
of
them,
san
clinton
and
folsom
there
had
over
the
years
accumulated
a
rather
rugged
collection
of
law
books
mostly
case
reports
and
mostly
more
than
10
years
old.
of
course
such
obsolete
law
books
were
worst
than
to
assist.
they
were
potentially
dangerous
because
misleading.
nonetheless,
despite
the
poor
condition
of
the
law
libraries,
inmates
and
other
institutions
have
a
misimpression
that
they
were
first
class
library
and
with
that,
the
director
has
request
to
transfers
to
san
clinton
and
folsom
in
order
to
utilize
the
library
facilities.
the
new
rules
attempted
to
solve
those
problems
by
standardizing
the
libraries
at
all
14
institutions.
this
was
to
be
done
by
providing
a
carefully
selective
list
of
what
they
call
basic
codes
and
references.
mr.
george
r.
nock
well,
the
adoption
of
the
regulation
your
honor
came
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
complaint.
the
regulation
was
adopted
on
september
19,
1966
and
complaint
is
filed
in
response
to
the
adoption
of
regulation
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
oh!
i
beg
your
pardon
yes
i
did,
that
was
certainly
here
five
years.
mr.
george
r.
nock
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
carefully
selected
list
of
law
books
contained
the
various
codes
of
the
state
of
california
designing
team
in
census,
the
state
and
federal
constitution,
a
law
dictionary,
rules
of
this
court,
the
california
courts,
and
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit,
inadvertently
omitted
and
regrettably
so
all
the
rules
by
federal
district
courts
in
california.
and
also
in
the
list
where
in
the
standard
work
on
california
criminal
procedure,
mr.
watkins(ph)
worked
on
that
title
and
the
subscription
to
the
weekly
law
digest,
the
california
publication
which
summarizes
the
most
recent
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
california
courts
and
all
areas
including
criminal
law.
the
response
were
totaling
this
complaint
on
october
27,
1966
by
the
plaintiffs,
a
group
of
inmates.
they
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
regulation
because
it
provided,
as
necessary
part
of
the
standardization
plan
that
law
books,
existing
law
books
at
the
two
institutions,
san
clinton
and
folsom
would
have
to
be
removed.
a
counsel
was
ultimately
appointed,
the
very
able
gentlemen
on
my
right.
thereafter,
i
think
at
all
times
through
counsel,
the
inmates
filed
an
amended
complaint
alleging
new
causes
of
action
not
related
to
the
infinite
deal
and
the
filing
motion
to
a
three-judge
court.
this
motion
was
denied
but
then
it
was
able
to
persuade
the
single
judge
to
certify
the
question
as
of
propriety
of
the
three-judge
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
an
interlocutory
appeal
along
that
issue
was
taken.
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
was
the
case
of
a
three-judge
court
and
it
reversed
the
order
of
the
district
court.
we
disagreed
and
filed
a
certiorari
petition.
now,
during
this
premise
as
early
as
they
could
it
was
not
a
three-judge
court
case.
our
position
is
requested
and
filed
and
certiorari
was
unanimously
denied.
the
case
went
back
to
the
district
court
where
a
three-judge
court
was
convened.
the
court
met
on
august
6,
1969,
requested
that
the
party
isolate
the
issue
suitable
for
a
three-judge
court
determination
and
certify
them
clearly
and
aid
the
court
as
much
as
possible
in
the
existing
issues
to
those
of
law.
we
complied
by
filing
lengthy
speculation
and
several
statement
of
issues
which
we
listed
five
issues,
and
the
first
two
of
which
we
consider
relevant
to
the
appeal
and
that
was
the
constitutionality
under
first
the
due
process
clause
and
second
to
equal
protection
clause
of
this
regulation.
we
stipulated
and
suggested
relief
which
included,
should
the
court
find
the
regulation
unconstitutional
or
the
declaration
has
been
constitutionality
and
then
the
injunction
against
this
enforcement.
mr.
george
r.
nock
under
the
present
regulations,
they
would
not
be
accepted
at
san
clinton
prison,
your
honor.
they
would
be
accepted
by
the
state
library
of
california
to
add
to
its
prisoner
collection
which
is
circulated
among
the
various
inmates
upon
request,
subject
to
the
availability,
if
the
request
is
done.
as
the
regulation
show
some
of
the
state
library
collections
are
missing,
but
they
do
contain
now
all
the
case
reports
that
any
california
prisoner
could
properly
desire.
mr.
george
r.
nock
standardization,
your
honor,
to
give
inmates
in
all
14
institutions
the
same
access
to
locally
based
law
books.
if
your
honor,
they
were
to
be
14
sets
for
the
state
of
california
to
use
in
its
penal
system
there
will
be
no
problem
in
distributing
the
14
sets
to
these
various
14
institutions.
mr.
george
r.
nock
correct,
your
honor.
the
regulation
did
not
contemplate
anyone
decreasing
the
extensive
collection
of
law
books
to
the
state.
the
regulation
is
capable
of
instant
revision
as
a
director
of
corrections
at
his
pleasure,
at
least
in
present
form
of
course
it
does
buy
just
that,
but
it
would
be
revised
under
appropriate
circumstances
to
affect
the
aims
of
standardization.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes
he
may.
he
may
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
it
depends
on
your
definition,
your
honor,
of
adequacy.
the
regulation
stipulates
that
personal
possession
of
law
books
or
any
books
are
limited
to
space
available.
in
san
clinton
for
example
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes,
indeed.
mr.
george
r.
nock
that
is
not
clear
in
the
present
regulation.
lending
would
be
discouraged.
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
it
would
be
impossible.
the
regulations
are
fluctuating
that
i
do
not
have
all
of
them
on
hand.
mr.
george
r.
nock
only
institutional
regulation.
san
clinton
allows
despite
of
its
space
limitation,
ten
hard
cover
volumes
of
whatever
description
legal
or
otherwise
plus
two
orange
boxes
full
of
unbound
material.
mr.
george
r.
nock
for
each
prison.
it
will
vary
from
institution
to
institution
depending
on
state.
the
district
court
held
a
second
hearing,
oral
argument.
at
no
time
had
the
court
given
any
indication
that
intended
to
or
they
are
even
considered
granting
relief
farther
than
that
asked
for
in
the
complaints
or
based
upon
stipulation,
but
it
did.
it
held
that
the
list
of
law
books
is
unconstitutional
and
at
the
state
had
an
obligation
to
turn
it
either
extensive
and
it
seems
very
extensive
collection
of
law
books
or
alternatively
to
provide
lawyers
or
law
students
to
assist
the
inmates
or
to
provide
some
unspecified
and
perhaps
not
even
conceived
of
other
method
of
assisting
inmates
in
preparation
of
their
petitions
and
complaints.
upon
that
order,
in
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
the
regulation
and
mandating
new
regulations
we
have
appealed
and
we
contend
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
appeal,
that
the
regulations
in
question
do
not
bar
access
to
the
courts
during
that,
do
not
deny
them
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
that
the
mandatory
injunction
of
the
district
court
violate
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
is
one
of
which
the
parties
did
not
raise.
we
are
in
agreement
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
issue
has
been
raised
by
the
court
itself
in
its
order
requesting
special
memorandum
on
issue
of
the
three-judge
district
court’s
jurisdiction,
that
of
course
is
coming
shortly
after
the
filing
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
in
the
postponement
rather
than
notation
of
jurisdiction
in
february
this
year.
mr.
george
r.
nock
oh!
i
am
sorry.
under
the
2254
the
california
weekly
digest
will
be
of
some
value
depending
on
how
set
back
it
went.
we
have
consulted
on
california
criminal
procedure
with
a
greater
value
but
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
2255
is
that
the
federal?
mr.
george
r.
nock
federal
court.
mr.
george
r.
nock
54,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
because
the
criminal
procedure
contains
the
applicable
constitutional
out
of
efficiency
of
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts
defining
constitutional
act.
they
were
helping
in
determining
what
his
rights
are
so
that
he
can
set
up
the
fact
which
he
thinks
his
right
was
denied.
that
would
be
the
function
of
witness.
if
he
wanted
to
know
which
court
to
file
in,
if
he
wanted
to
know
whom
to
name
his
respondent,
he
is
going
now
to
rely
on
word
of
mouth.
i
have
never
heard
of
an
inmate
making
a
serious
error
in
either
of
those
situations.
but
if
he
wants
to
get
to
perform
the
necessary
procedural
requisite
to
getting
efficient
file
all
he
has
to
do
is
fill-out
the
11-page
form
provided
by
the
prisons
free
of
charge
to
all
inmates
approved
by
the
local
district
courts.
mr.
george
r.
nock
he
will
help
him
in
finding
substantive
rights.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes
indeed.
mr.
george
r.
nock
the
original
book
goes
back
to,
i
think
1963.
it
is
supplemented
annually
or
biannually
by
pocket
parts
or
pamphlet
supplement
or
both.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes.
mr.
george
r.
nock
well
i
urge
of
perusal
and
big
perusal
of
it
which
show
that
all
the
significant
cases
with
this
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
with
regards
to
substitute
constitutional
rights
if
prisoners
are
there.
our
position
on
jurisdiction
is
simple
one
of
reach
to
the
color
that
the
issue
has
been
determined
by
a
final
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
cannot
take
too
much
though.
i
argued
that
it
was
not
a
three-judge
court
case.
we
lost
the
argument
before
this
court.
the
judgment
became
final
and
now
i
can
only
assert
that
it
was
the
determinably
inequitable.
that
this
might
be
the
court
to
all
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
and
send
the
matter
back
for
a
further
appeal,
other
case
is
nearly
five
years
old.
if
we
are
still
litigating
in
proper
composition
of
the
tribunal
to
determine
it
then
the
law
has
failed
and
we
think
that
any
discretion
imposing
it
in
this
court
should
be
exercised
in
favor
of
assuming
jurisdiction.
and
that
by
viewing
the
case
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
res
judicata.
there
is
no
discretion
and
jurisdiction
is
clear
and
must
be
accepted.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
access
to
the
courts
we
do
not
believe
that
law
books
are
necessary
for
access
to
the
courts.
it
is
a
cliché
to
say,
but
it
would
be
equally
true
that
all
an
inmate
has
to
do
is
set-out
in
reasonably
intelligible
form
the
statement
is
after
the
same.
the
statement
might
be
very
long
to
charge
with
case
of
complaint.
it
might
be
short
if
he
is
claiming,
he
pleaded
guilty
because
he
was
beaten
or
because
they
have
found
something
that
he
did
not
get,
but
all
he
has
to
do
is
set
them
out.
the
court
will
apply
the
law,
arguments,
citations,
and
authority.
after
this
it
may
consider
not
only
necessary,
but
that
is
even
improper.
in
habeas
corpus
petition
themselves,
notwithstanding
that
lawyers
will
attend
the
memorandum
points
and
authorities
in
most
cases.
inmates
are
not
well
equipped
to
use
law
books,
at
least
they
are
not
relative
to
use
the
united
states
reports,
the
california
reports,
the
federal
reports,
u.s.
law
week
and
the
other
publications
alluded
to
by
the
district
court
as
not
being
present.
it
is
questionable
what
value
those
books
would
be
to
an
inmate
in
helping
him
to
file
a
section
2254
petition
as
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
because
they
do
not
give
in
any
reasonably
acceptable
and
understandable
point
of
rules
in
jurisdiction
and
then
you
--
that
an
inmate
might
have
a
little
trouble
in
getting.
he
gets
those
from
the
forms,
from
mr.
watkins
book
and
from
the
weekly
law
digest.
the
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
that
is
our
position.
it
is
not
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
constitutionally
yes.
i
believe
that
most
of
the
states
provide
no
law
books
at
all
and
that
this
violates
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
that
is
one
issue
because
the
court
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
regulation
requiring
removal
of
law
books
into
institution
to
get
an
outright
reversal
of
that
order.
we
have
to
contend
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
at
all.
we
would
be
happy
of
course
finding
that
if
any
constitutional
(inaudible)
that
is
made
by
this
writ,
and
i
might
add
there
are
omissions
in
the
list
which
presumably
would
be
rectified
in
the
event
of
deferment.
minor
omissions
such
as
the
absence
of
the
united
states
code,
the
judicial
code
i
should
say,
28
u.s.c.
mr.
george
r.
nock
district
court
rules
certainly
should
be
in
there.
that
was
a
serious
inadvertent
there
for
three
volumes,
two
of
them
paperback,
one
hardcover
would
provide
we
think
all
consumable
omissions,
namely
the
volume
containing
28
u.s.c.,
federal
appellate
procedure,
federal
civil
procedure,
the
volume
containing
the
rules
for
all
california
and
california
federal
courts
and
mr.
selbrooks
(ph)
book
on
habeas
corpus.
but
with
those
possible
deficiencies
we
submit
that
the
list
adequately
provides
what
the
inmates
need.
equal
protection
has
overtly
played
in
here
as
a
sort
of
neglect.
the
district
court
relied
on
it,
but
the
basic
course
of
its
position
was
that
the
restricted
nature
of
the
law
book
was
denied
inmates'
access
to
the
courts.
we
think
that
it
is
not
declared
totally
speak
equal
protection
in
this
context
because
if
inmate
or
by
their
indigency
disadvantaged
so
greatly
that
they
are
denied
in
fact
of
this
access
of
the
court
and
of
course
equal
protection
would
be
denied
in
any
other
circumstances
because
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
not
as
well
of
as
a
rich
man
does
not
add
much
to
the
discussion
that
equal
protection,
including
a
major
issue.
however,
we
give
it
some
attention,
more
attention
that
might
hear
in
our
reply
brief.
finally,
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
was
of
considerable
importance.
that
amendment
is
not
been
much
discussed
by
this
court
in
recent
years,
but
it
has
been
given
deal
of
attention
in
the
lower
courts
and
many
lower
courts
have
exceeded
to
the
temptation
to
order
the
states
to
appropriate
money.

moore

his

has
effectively

this
contention.
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
with
the
court’s
permission,
reserve
any
time
remaining
after
lunch
for
rebuttal.

you,

on
the
point
of

to
whether

at

or
more

i
got
the

impression
from
reading
the
opinion
that
it
had
more
than
one
and
i
felt
that
the
opinion
is
written
on
the
premise,
perhaps
the
matter
should
be
investigated
before
the
case
can
be
held
to
stand
to
the
authorities
that
or
to
stand
for
the
proposition
of
three-judge
court
is
not
required.
mr.
george
r.
nock
no
question
at
all.
mr.
george
r.
nock
indeed.
mr.
george
r.
nock
no.
mr.
george
r.
nock
oh!
i
missed
that
your
honor.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
others
except
(inaudible)
which
did
not
decide
the
particular
point
and
the
affirmance
across
the
case
which
is
cited
in
the
area.
certiorari
petition
and
mr.
(inaudible).
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
about
section
2600
that
is
section
which
is
called
the
inmate
bill
of
rights.
it
does
not
mention
law
books.
it
just
gives
inmates
the
right
to
purchase,
receive
and
read
written
material
of
all
description
with
certain
specific
exceptions.
yet
it
has
been
interpreted
and
i
think
corrected
by
the
director
of
correction
as
requiring
the
inmates
to
be
allowed
to
purchase
a
law
book
at
specified
space
limitation.
but
it
is
rather
ironic
in
that
the
full
record
will
show
that
prior
to
enactment
of
the
section,
prison
rules
provides
inmates
to
own
personally
on
law
books
and
to
posses
personally
on
law
books
and
the
reason
for
this
and
the
basis
on
which
we
depended
it
was
equal
protection.
the
director
did
not
want
to
have
the
appellant
inmate
allowed
to
own
more
than
the
two
law
books
that
is
not
available
to
the
indigent
inmate
and
it
was
firstly
then
in
the
decision
because
of
the
concept
of
the
statute.
it
did
not
want
to
litigate
in
the
state
courts
on
unconstitutionality
of
statute
upon
that
ground.
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
the
collateral
proceedings
is
based
on
mr.
justice
white
is
detailed
in
people
versus
shipman
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
that
is
62
california
2nd,
shipman
where
the
court
in
that
case
dealt
with
habeas
corpus
on
officially
moratorium
petition
is
presented
then
counsel
is
appointed
normally
to
handle
the
evidentiary
hearing.
there
is
no
appeal
in
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
they
re-file
on
the
higher
court
and
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
not
necessary
requirement.
there
is
appeal
in
coram
nobis
cases.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes
indeed.
and
in
coram
nobis,
the
counsel
was
appointed
in
the
trial
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
counsel
is
always
appointed
automatically
in
the
court
reviewing
the
denial
of
coram
nobis
for
the
case
in
litigation.
mr.
wahl
handled
in
various
cases.
mr.
chief
justice
as
commonly
said
to
this
books
were
in
each
prison
and
the
regulations
provide
that
there
will
be
sufficient
copies
to
provide
regular
access
on
that
list
in
a
weekly
basis
that
is
administrative
manual
section
230.042
which
is
set
out
in
both
needs
in
the
appendix.
mr.
george
r.
nock
well,
the
regulation
has
not
been
fully
implemented
because
of
its
litigation
but
and
i
do
not
know
how
whether
there
are
as
much
in
one
set
in
each
prison
now
but
there
will
be
to
be
sure
(voice
overlap).
indeed
an
infinite
number
that
is
included.
they
justified
also
that
if
there
are
any
legal
aid
attorneys
or
public
defenders.
they
are
not
for
the
purpose
of
the
habeas
corpus
although
in
one
county,
solano
county
where
the
institution
is
located,
the
judge
automatically
appoints
counsel
--
appoints
the
public
defenders
or
counsel
whenever
an
order
to
show
cause
is
issued.
he
does
not
however
normally
confer
with
prisons.
some
county
public
defenders
will
continue
to
represent
their
clients,
appellant
clients
in
post-conviction
proceedings.
whether
they
are
allowed
to
do
so
as
a
matter
of
between
them
in
a
particular
for
the
supervisors.
it
is
neither
authorization
nor
proposition
on
the
state
wide
basis.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes,
he
has
the
duty
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
which
is
the
case
of
the
appellate
court
sustain
the
point
of
counsel
if
the
defendant
is
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
appoints
counsel.
mr.
george
r.
nock
usually
a
different
one,
usually
the
same
lawyer
that
one
had,
unless
he
requests
or
the
client
requests
that
he
is
only
appointed.
mr.
george
r.
nock
no,
they
normally
simply
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes
there
are
a
number
of
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes.
mr.
george
r.
nock
there
is
no
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
there
is
no
duty
to
petition
for
a
hearing,
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
the
individual.
court
of
appeals
authorizes
the
petition
for
current
hearing
and
normally
does
but
it
is
not
oblige
to
do
so.
if
the
california
supreme
court
grants
a
hearing
it
appoints
counsel
but
is
usually
the
same
counsel
appointed
in
court
of
appeals,
but
not
necessarily.
mr.
george
r.
nock
well,
not
if
the
attorney
does
not
do
authority,
but
normally
an
attorney,
well,
at
least
if
his
clients
requests
a
petition
for
hearing
as
the
nine
out
of
ten
cases.
mr.
george
r.
nock
he
is
not
required
to
because
he
has
the
option
of
concluding
what
he
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes.
mr.
george
r.
nock
oh
yes,
yes
indeed.
in
the
area
of
the
case
only
we
call
a
couple
of
cases
who
are
in
need
to
file
his
own
petition
for
that.
and
i
know
of
none
where
an
attorney
has
refused
to
file
upon
the
request
of
an
indigent
client.
but
he
will
often
will
if
the
appeal
was
frivolous
to
begin
with
(inaudible)
supreme
court
and
client
will
advise
not
to
quit.
mr.
george
r.
nock
i
mentioned
earlier
the
legislation
your
honor
in
this
case.
the
question
was
really
as
to
whether
this
is
or
rather
mr.
wahl
indicated
that
our
position
was
that
this
would
encourage,
these
law
books
would
encourage
litigation.
we
take
no
such
position.
i
have
no
idea
whether
it
would
encourage
litigation
or
not.
personally
i
think
law
books
have
make
no
difference
in
the
volume
of
litigation
or
question
of
how
many,
the
percentage
i
should
think
how
frivolous
petition.
but
legal
assistance
before
even
lawsuit,
it
might
cut
down
the
volume
of
frivolous
petitions
somewhat
although
that
is
speculative
the
way
it
has
to
rely
on
experiences
as
the
case
is
adopted
uniform
for
his
conviction.
procedure
doctrine
and
what
i
can
tell
by
reading
the
law
review
articles
locally
on
the
subject
of
the
verdict
is
not
in
yet.
it
is
(inaudible)
post-conviction
procedure
or
its
equivalent
has
been
cutting
down
the
number
of
frivolous
petition.
mr.
george
r.
nock
i
know
it
said
in
the
brief
of
amici
and
it
set
the
12
volume
and
by
review
beginning
page
149
of
it,
very
extensive
and
thorough
survey
of
post-conviction
remedies
done
for
the
federal
judicial
institute.
mr.
george
r.
nock
on
page
149.
it
runs
about
35
pages.
and
i
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
george
r.
nock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
five
years
ago,
last
month
the
director
of
corrections
in
california
adopted
a
new
regulation
regarding
prison
law
library.
it
was
in
response
to
a
certain
problem
he
faced.
in
two
of
the
three
institutions
under
his
control
there
were
few
or
any
law
books
at
all.
in
two
of
them,
san
clinton
and
folsom
there
had
over
the
years
accumulated
a
rather
rugged
collection
of
law
books
mostly
case
reports
and
mostly
more
than
10
years
old.
of
course
such
obsolete
law
books
were
worst
than
to
assist.
they
were
potentially
dangerous
because
misleading.
nonetheless,
despite
the
poor
condition
of
the
law
libraries,
inmates
and
other
institutions
have
a
misimpression
that
they
were
first
class
library
and
with
that,
the
director
has
request
to
transfers
to
san
clinton
and
folsom
in
order
to
utilize
the
library
facilities.
the
new
rules
attempted
to
solve
those
problems
by
standardizing
the
libraries
at
all
14
institutions.
this
was
to
be
done
by
providing
a
carefully
selective
list
of
what
they
call
basic
codes
and
references.
mr.
george
r.
nock
well,
the
adoption
of
the
regulation
your
honor
came
prior
to
the
filing
of
this
complaint.
the
regulation
was
adopted
on
september
19,
1966
and
complaint
is
filed
in
response
to
the
adoption
of
regulation
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
oh!
i
beg
your
pardon
yes
i
did,
that
was
certainly
here
five
years.
mr.
george
r.
nock
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
carefully
selected
list
of
law
books
contained
the
various
codes
of
the
state
of
california
designing
team
in
census,
the
state
and
federal
constitution,
a
law
dictionary,
rules
of
this
court,
the
california
courts,
and
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit,
inadvertently
omitted
and
regrettably
so
all
the
rules
by
federal
district
courts
in
california.
and
also
in
the
list
where
in
the
standard
work
on
california
criminal
procedure,
mr.
watkins(ph)
worked
on
that
title
and
the
subscription
to
the
weekly
law
digest,
the
california
publication
which
summarizes
the
most
recent
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
california
courts
and
all
areas
including
criminal
law.
the
response
were
totaling
this
complaint
on
october
27,
1966
by
the
plaintiffs,
a
group
of
inmates.
they
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
regulation
because
it
provided,
as
necessary
part
of
the
standardization
plan
that
law
books,
existing
law
books
at
the
two
institutions,
san
clinton
and
folsom
would
have
to
be
removed.
a
counsel
was
ultimately
appointed,
the
very
able
gentlemen
on
my
right.
thereafter,
i
think
at
all
times
through
counsel,
the
inmates
filed
an
amended
complaint
alleging
new
causes
of
action
not
related
to
the
infinite
deal
and
the
filing
motion
to
a
three-judge
court.
this
motion
was
denied
but
then
it
was
able
to
persuade
the
single
judge
to
certify
the
question
as
of
propriety
of
the
three-judge
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
an
interlocutory
appeal
along
that
issue
was
taken.
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
was
the
case
of
a
three-judge
court
and
it
reversed
the
order
of
the
district
court.
we
disagreed
and
filed
a
certiorari
petition.
now,
during
this
premise
as
early
as
they
could
it
was
not
a
three-judge
court
case.
our
position
is
requested
and
filed
and
certiorari
was
unanimously
denied.
the
case
went
back
to
the
district
court
where
a
three-judge
court
was
convened.
the
court
met
on
august
6,
1969,
requested
that
the
party
isolate
the
issue
suitable
for
a
three-judge
court
determination
and
certify
them
clearly
and
aid
the
court
as
much
as
possible
in
the
existing
issues
to
those
of
law.
we
complied
by
filing
lengthy
speculation
and
several
statement
of
issues
which
we
listed
five
issues,
and
the
first
two
of
which
we
consider
relevant
to
the
appeal
and
that
was
the
constitutionality
under
first
the
due
process
clause
and
second
to
equal
protection
clause
of
this
regulation.
we
stipulated
and
suggested
relief
which
included,
should
the
court
find
the
regulation
unconstitutional
or
the
declaration
has
been
constitutionality
and
then
the
injunction
against
this
enforcement.
mr.
george
r.
nock
under
the
present
regulations,
they
would
not
be
accepted
at
san
clinton
prison,
your
honor.
they
would
be
accepted
by
the
state
library
of
california
to
add
to
its
prisoner
collection
which
is
circulated
among
the
various
inmates
upon
request,
subject
to
the
availability,
if
the
request
is
done.
as
the
regulation
show
some
of
the
state
library
collections
are
missing,
but
they
do
contain
now
all
the
case
reports
that
any
california
prisoner
could
properly
desire.
mr.
george
r.
nock
standardization,
your
honor,
to
give
inmates
in
all
14
institutions
the
same
access
to
locally
based
law
books.
if
your
honor,
they
were
to
be
14
sets
for
the
state
of
california
to
use
in
its
penal
system
there
will
be
no
problem
in
distributing
the
14
sets
to
these
various
14
institutions.
mr.
george
r.
nock
correct,
your
honor.
the
regulation
did
not
contemplate
anyone
decreasing
the
extensive
collection
of
law
books
to
the
state.
the
regulation
is
capable
of
instant
revision
as
a
director
of
corrections
at
his
pleasure,
at
least
in
present
form
of
course
it
does
buy
just
that,
but
it
would
be
revised
under
appropriate
circumstances
to
affect
the
aims
of
standardization.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes
he
may.
he
may
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
it
depends
on
your
definition,
your
honor,
of
adequacy.
the
regulation
stipulates
that
personal
possession
of
law
books
or
any
books
are
limited
to
space
available.
in
san
clinton
for
example
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes,
indeed.
mr.
george
r.
nock
that
is
not
clear
in
the
present
regulation.
lending
would
be
discouraged.
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
it
would
be
impossible.
the
regulations
are
fluctuating
that
i
do
not
have
all
of
them
on
hand.
mr.
george
r.
nock
only
institutional
regulation.
san
clinton
allows
despite
of
its
space
limitation,
ten
hard
cover
volumes
of
whatever
description
legal
or
otherwise
plus
two
orange
boxes
full
of
unbound
material.
mr.
george
r.
nock
for
each
prison.
it
will
vary
from
institution
to
institution
depending
on
state.
the
district
court
held
a
second
hearing,
oral
argument.
at
no
time
had
the
court
given
any
indication
that
intended
to
or
they
are
even
considered
granting
relief
farther
than
that
asked
for
in
the
complaints
or
based
upon
stipulation,
but
it
did.
it
held
that
the
list
of
law
books
is
unconstitutional
and
at
the
state
had
an
obligation
to
turn
it
either
extensive
and
it
seems
very
extensive
collection
of
law
books
or
alternatively
to
provide
lawyers
or
law
students
to
assist
the
inmates
or
to
provide
some
unspecified
and
perhaps
not
even
conceived
of
other
method
of
assisting
inmates
in
preparation
of
their
petitions
and
complaints.
upon
that
order,
in
enjoining
the
enforcement
of
the
regulation
and
mandating
new
regulations
we
have
appealed
and
we
contend
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
this
appeal,
that
the
regulations
in
question
do
not
bar
access
to
the
courts
during
that,
do
not
deny
them
equal
protection
of
the
law
and
that
the
mandatory
injunction
of
the
district
court
violate
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
is
one
of
which
the
parties
did
not
raise.
we
are
in
agreement
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
issue
has
been
raised
by
the
court
itself
in
its
order
requesting
special
memorandum
on
issue
of
the
three-judge
district
court’s
jurisdiction,
that
of
course
is
coming
shortly
after
the
filing
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
in
the
postponement
rather
than
notation
of
jurisdiction
in
february
this
year.
mr.
george
r.
nock
oh!
i
am
sorry.
under
the
2254
the
california
weekly
digest
will
be
of
some
value
depending
on
how
set
back
it
went.
we
have
consulted
on
california
criminal
procedure
with
a
greater
value
but
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
2255
is
that
the
federal?
mr.
george
r.
nock
federal
court.
mr.
george
r.
nock
54,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
because
the
criminal
procedure
contains
the
applicable
constitutional
out
of
efficiency
of
this
court
and
the
other
federal
courts
defining
constitutional
act.
they
were
helping
in
determining
what
his
rights
are
so
that
he
can
set
up
the
fact
which
he
thinks
his
right
was
denied.
that
would
be
the
function
of
witness.
if
he
wanted
to
know
which

if
he
wanted
to
know
whom
to
name
his
respondent,
he
is
going
now
to
rely
on
word
of
mouth.
i
have
never
heard
of
an
inmate
making
a
serious
error
in
either
of
those
situations.
but
if
he
wants
to
get
to
perform
the
necessary
procedural
requisite
to
getting
efficient
file
all
he
has
to
do
is
fill-out
the
11-page
form
provided
by
the

free
of
charge
to
all
inmates
approved
by
the
local
district
courts.
mr.
george
r.
nock
he
will
help
him
in
finding
substantive
rights.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes
indeed.
mr.
george
r.
nock
the
original
book
goes
back
to,
i
think
1963.
it
is
supplemented
annually
or
biannually
by
pocket
parts
or
pamphlet
supplement
or
both.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes.
mr.
george
r.
nock
well
i
urge
of
perusal
and
big
perusal
of
it
which
show
that
all
the
significant
cases
with
this
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
with
regards
to
substitute
constitutional
rights
if
prisoners
are
there.
our
position
on
jurisdiction
is
simple
one
of
reach
to
the
color
that
the
issue
has
been
determined
by
a
final
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
cannot
take
too
much
though.
i
argued
that
it
was
not
a
three-judge
court
case.
we
lost
the
argument
before
this
court.
the
judgment
became
final
and
now
i
can
only
assert
that
it
was
the
determinably
inequitable.
that
this
might
be
the
court
to
all
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
and
send
the
matter
back
for
a
further
appeal,
other
case
is
nearly
five
years
old.
if
we
are
still
litigating
in
proper
composition
of
the
tribunal
to
determine
it
then
the
law
has
failed
and
we
think
that
any
discretion
imposing
it
in
this
court
should
be
exercised
in
favor
of
assuming
jurisdiction.
and
that
by
viewing
the
case
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
res
judicata.
there
is
no
discretion
and
jurisdiction
is
clear
and
must
be
accepted.
with
regard
to
the
question
of
access
to
the
courts
we
do
not
believe
that
law
books
are
necessary
for
access
to
the
courts.
it
is
a
cliché
to
say,
but
it
would
be
equally
true
that
all
an
inmate
has
to
do
is
set-out
in
reasonably
intelligible
form
the
statement
is
after
the
same.
the
statement
might
be
very
long
to
charge
with
case
of
complaint.
it
might
be
short
if
he
is
claiming,
he
pleaded
guilty
because
he
was
beaten
or
because
they
have
found
something
that
he
did
not
get,
but
all
he
has
to
do
is
set
them
out.
the
court
will
apply
the
law,
arguments,
citations,
and
authority.
after
this
it
may
consider
not
only
necessary,
but
that
is
even
improper.

corpus

notwithstanding
that
lawyers
will
attend

points
and

in
most
cases.
inmates
are
not
well
equipped
to
use
law
books,
at
least
they
are
not
relative
to
use
the
united
states
reports,
the
california
reports,
the
federal
reports,
u.s.
law

and
the
other
publications
alluded
to
by
the
district
court
as
not
being
present.
it
is
questionable
what
value
those
books
would
be
to
an
inmate
in
helping
him
to
file
a
section
2254
petition
as
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
because
they
do
not
give
in
any
reasonably
acceptable
and
understandable
point
of
rules
in
jurisdiction
and
then
you
--
that
an
inmate
might
have
a
little
trouble
in
getting.
he
gets
those
from
the
forms,
from
mr.
watkins
book
and
from
the
weekly
law
digest.
the
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
that
is
our
position.
it
is
not
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
constitutionally
yes.
i
believe
that
most
of
the
states
provide
no
law
books
at
all
and
that
this
violates
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
that
is
one
issue
because
the
court
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
the
regulation
requiring
removal
of
law
books
into
institution
to
get
an
outright
reversal
of
that
order.
we
have
to
contend
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
at
all.
we
would
be
happy
of
course
finding
that
if
any
constitutional
(inaudible)
that
is
made
by
this
writ,
and
i
might
add
there
are
omissions
in
the
list
which
presumably
would
be
rectified
in
the
event
of
deferment.
minor
omissions
such
as
the
absence
of
the
united
states
code,
the
judicial
code
i
should
say,
28
u.s.c.
mr.
george
r.
nock
district
court
rules
certainly
should
be
in
there.
that
was
a
serious
inadvertent
there
for
three
volumes,
two
of
them
paperback,
one
hardcover
would
provide
we
think
all
consumable
omissions,
namely
the
volume
containing
28
u.s.c.,
federal
appellate
procedure,
federal
civil
procedure,
the
volume
containing
the
rules
for
all
california
and
california
federal
courts
and
mr.
selbrooks
(ph)
book
on
habeas
corpus.
but
with
those
possible
deficiencies
we
submit
that
the
list
adequately
provides
what
the
inmates
need.
equal
protection
has
overtly
played
in
here
as
a
sort
of
neglect.
the
district
court
relied
on
it,
but
the
basic
course
of
its
position
was
that
the
restricted
nature
of
the
law
book
was
denied
inmates'
access
to
the
courts.
we
think
that
it
is
not
declared
totally
speak
equal
protection
in
this
context
because
if
inmate
or
by
their
indigency
disadvantaged
so
greatly
that
they
are
denied
in
fact
of
this
access
of
the
court
and
of
course
equal
protection
would
be
denied
in
any
other
circumstances
because
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
not
as
well
of
as
a
rich
man
does
not
add
much
to
the
discussion
that
equal
protection,
including
a
major
issue.
however,
we
give
it
some
attention,
more
attention
that
might
hear
in
our
reply
brief.
finally,
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
was
of
considerable
importance.
that
amendment
is
not
been
much
discussed
by
this
court
in
recent
years,
but
it
has
been
given
deal
of
attention
in
the
lower
courts
and
many
lower
courts
have
exceeded
to
the
temptation
to
order
the
states
to
appropriate
money.
judge
virlyn
moore
in
his
opinion
in

has
effectively
answered
this
contention.
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
with
the
court’s
permission,
reserve
any
time
remaining
after
lunch
for
rebuttal.
mr.
george
r.
nock
thank
you,
your
honor.
on
the
point
of
the
forms
raised
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
they
are
indeed
in
original
record
and
furthermore
we
filed
an
amicus
brief,
in
the
case
of

versus

of
terms
ago

to

mr.

beg
your
pardon?

mr.
george
r.
nock
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
mr.
wahl
about
the
hatfield
case.
i
would
only
make
the
observation
that
a
lawyer
has
no
personal
knowledge
as
to
whether
oregon
at
that
time
had
only
one
penitentiary
or
more
than
one.
i
got
the
distinction
impression
from
reading
the
opinion
that
it
had
more
than
one
and
i
felt
that
the
opinion
is
written
on
the
premise,
perhaps
the
matter
should
be
investigated
before
the
case
can
be
held
to
stand
to
the
authorities
that
or
to
stand
for
the
proposition
of
three-judge
court
is
not
required.
mr.
george
r.
nock
no
question
at
all.
mr.
george
r.
nock
indeed.
mr.
george
r.
nock
no.
mr.
george
r.
nock
oh!
i
missed
that
your
honor.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
others
except
(inaudible)
which
did
not
decide
the
particular
point
and
the
affirmance
across
the
case
which
is
cited
in
the
area.
certiorari
petition
and
mr.
(inaudible).
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
about
section
2600
that
is
section
which
is
called
the
inmate
bill
of
rights.
it
does
not
mention
law
books.
it
just
gives
inmates
the
right
to
purchase,
receive
and
read
written
material
of
all
description
with
certain
specific
exceptions.
yet
it
has
been
interpreted
and
i
think
corrected
by
the
director
of
correction
as
requiring
the
inmates
to
be
allowed
to
purchase
a
law
book
at
specified
space
limitation.
but
it
is
rather
ironic
in
that
the
full
record
will
show
that
prior
to
enactment
of
the
section,
prison
rules
provides
inmates
to
own
personally
on
law
books
and
to
posses
personally
on
law
books
and
the
reason
for
this
and
the
basis
on
which
we
depended
it
was
equal
protection.
the
director
did
not
want
to
have
the
appellant
inmate
allowed
to
own
more
than
the
two
law
books
that
is
not
available
to
the
indigent
inmate
and
it
was
firstly
then
in
the
decision
because
of
the
concept
of
the
statute.
it
did
not
want
to
litigate
in
the
state
courts
on
unconstitutionality
of
statute
upon
that
ground.
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
the
collateral
proceedings
is
based
on
mr.
justice
white
is
detailed
in
people
versus
shipman
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
that
is
62
california
2nd,
shipman
where
the
court
in
that
case
dealt
with
habeas
corpus
on
officially
moratorium
petition
is
presented
then
counsel
is
appointed
normally
to
handle
the
evidentiary
hearing.
there
is
no
appeal
in
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
they
re-file
on
the
higher
court
and
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
not
necessary
requirement.
there
is
appeal
in
coram
nobis
cases.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes
indeed.
and
in
coram
nobis,
the
counsel
was
appointed
in
the
trial
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
counsel
is
always
appointed
automatically
in
the
court
reviewing
the
denial
of
coram
nobis
for
the
case
in
litigation.
mr.
wahl
handled
in
various
cases.
mr.
chief
justice
as
commonly
said
to
this
books
were
in
each
prison
and
the
regulations
provide
that
there
will
be
sufficient
copies
to
provide
regular
access
on
that
list
in
a
weekly
basis
that
is
administrative
manual
section
230.042
which
is
set
out
in
both
needs
in
the
appendix.
mr.
george
r.
nock
well,
the
regulation
has
not
been
fully
implemented
because
of
its
litigation
but
and
i
do
not
know
how
whether
there
are
as
much
in
one
set
in
each
prison
now
but
there
will
be
to
be
sure
(voice
overlap).
indeed
an
infinite
number
that
is
included.
they
justified
also
that
if
there
are
any
legal
aid
attorneys
or
public
defenders.
they
are
not
for
the
purpose
of
the
habeas
corpus
although
in
one
county,
solano
county
where
the
institution
is
located,
the
judge
automatically
appoints
counsel
--
appoints
the
public
defenders
or
counsel
whenever
an
order
to
show
cause
is
issued.
he
does
not
however
normally
confer
with
prisons.
some
county
public
defenders
will
continue
to
represent
their
clients,
appellant
clients
in
post-conviction
proceedings.
whether
they
are
allowed
to
do
so
as
a
matter
of
between
them
in
a
particular
for
the
supervisors.
it
is
neither
authorization
nor
proposition
on
the
state
wide
basis.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes,
he
has
the
duty
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
which
is
the
case
of
the
appellate
court
sustain
the
point
of
counsel
if
the
defendant
is
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
appoints
counsel.
mr.
george
r.
nock
usually
a
different
one,
usually
the
same
lawyer
that
one
had,
unless
he
requests
or
the
client
requests
that
he
is
only
appointed.
mr.
george
r.
nock
no,
they
normally
simply
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes
there
are
a
number
of
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes.
mr.
george
r.
nock
there
is
no
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
there
is
no
duty
to
petition
for
a
hearing,
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
the
individual.
court
of
appeals
authorizes
the
petition
for
current
hearing
and
normally
does
but
it
is
not
oblige
to
do
so.
if
the
california
supreme
court
grants
a
hearing
it
appoints
counsel
but
is
usually
the
same
counsel
appointed
in
court
of
appeals,
but
not
necessarily.
mr.
george
r.
nock
well,
not
if
the
attorney
does
not
do
authority,
but
normally
an
attorney,
well,
at
least
if
his
clients
requests
a
petition
for
hearing
as
the
nine
out
of
ten
cases.
mr.
george
r.
nock
he
is
not
required
to
because
he
has
the
option
of
concluding
what
he
--
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes.
mr.
george
r.
nock
yes.
mr.
george
r.
nock
oh
yes,
yes
indeed.
in
the
area
of
the
case
only
we
call
a
couple
of
cases
who
are
in
need
to
file
his
own
petition
for
that.
and
i
know
of
none
where
an
attorney
has
refused
to
file
upon
the
request
of
an
indigent
client.
but
he
will
often
will
if
the
appeal
was
frivolous
to
begin
with
(inaudible)
supreme
court
and
client
will
advise
not
to
quit.
mr.
george
r.
nock
i
mentioned
earlier
the
legislation
your
honor
in
this
case.
the
question
was
really
as
to
whether
this
is
or
rather
mr.
wahl
indicated
that
our
position
was
that
this
would
encourage,
these
law
books
would
encourage
litigation.
we
take
no
such
position.
i
have
no
idea
whether
it
would
encourage
litigation
or
not.
personally
i
think
law
books
have
make
no
difference
in
the
volume
of
litigation
or
question
of
how
many,
the
percentage
i
should
think
how
frivolous
petition.
but
legal
assistance
before
even
lawsuit,
it
might
cut
down
the
volume
of
frivolous
petitions
somewhat
although
that
is
speculative
the
way
it
has
to
rely
on
experiences
as
the
case
is
adopted
uniform
for
his
conviction.
procedure
doctrine
and
what
i
can
tell
by
reading
the
law
review
articles
locally
on
the
subject
of
the
verdict
is
not
in
yet.
it
is
(inaudible)
post-conviction
procedure
or
its
equivalent
has
been
cutting
down
the
number
of
frivolous
petition.
mr.
george
r.
nock
i
know
it
said
in
the
brief
of
amici
and
it
set
the
12
volume

by
review
beginning

of
it,

extensive
and
thorough
survey
of
