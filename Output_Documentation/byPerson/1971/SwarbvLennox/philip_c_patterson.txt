mr.
philip
c.
patterson
thank
you
your
honor.
i
represent
the
middle
atlantic
finance
association
and
15
members
of
companies,
who
were
the
intervening
defendants
in
this
action.
and
in
view
of
shortness
of
my
time
because
mr.
matz
here
will
take
10
minutes
after
me,
i
will
not
ask
for
rebuttal.
now,
the
first
question
that
i
would
like
to
cover
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
deferred
hearing
following
judgment
violates
due
process
when
every
opportunity
is
given
to
the
defendant
to
present
every
defense
he
has
and
the
main
contentions
that
are
presented
by
the
plaintiffs
in
that
regard
are
not
that
there
is
anything
inherently
wrongful
with
having
a
deferred
hearing
of
this
sort.
but
they
are
contending
that
it
is
permissible
only
when
there
are
some
overriding
governmental
interests.
and
i
would
merely
like
to
point
out
that
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
on
that
subject,
rebut
that
argument
because
for
example
that
the
coffin
case
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
which
was
a
suit
by
the
liquidator
of
an
insolvent
bank
against
its
stockholders
is
certainly
not
a
suit
on
behalf
of
the
government,
it
is
just
an
ordinary
lawsuit
between
a
bank
and
stockholders,
and
that
case
specifically
held
that
even
though
execution
was
an
assessment,
which
is
like
a
judgment
and
also
an
execution
were
issued
before
any
hearing
has
been
held
and
even
though
a
lien
was
acquired
upon
the
stockholders
stock.
nevertheless,
because
the
stockholder
had
a
procedural
opportunity
under
the
georgia
procedure
to
present
all
defenses,
because
he
get
on
the
hearing
before
he
was
actually
deprived
of
that
property
that
that
complied
with
due
process.
there
are
many
other
cases
to
that
affect.
for
example,
there
is
one
case
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
bank
of
colombia
versus
oakley
decided
in
1890
and
17
united
states
233.
now,
that
case
held
likewise
and
there
also
there
was
a
lien
and
i
will
not
burden
your
honors
with
the
description
either
accept
the
state
that
there
was
a
statute
that
provided
that
anytime
a
note
was
payable
at
the
bank,
the
bank
could
go
ahead
and
issue
execution
and
acquire
a
lien
and
but
then
there
would
still
be
a
right
to
a
hearing
afterwards.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
there
is
no
cross-appeal
however
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
the
controversy
is
as
follows,
the
court
below
found
made
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
only
as
to
loans
by
our
clients
to
consumers
with
incomes
of
$10,000.00
or
under
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
the
plaintiffs
here
are
appealing
and
asking
the
court
to
extend
this
decision
to
people
with
income
over
$10,000.00.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
because
the
plaintiffs
are
trying
to,
plainly
represent
people
and
consumers
with
incomes
over
$10,000.00
and
because
we
represent
lenders,
who
are
lending
money
to
people
with
over
$10,000.00
it
is
our
position
that
we
are
entitled
to
argue
all
constitutional
questions
for
that
reason
and
that
is
another
point.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
except
well,
including
that
the
principles
that
were
laid
down
by
the
court
with
respect
to
people
under
$10,000.00
are
wrong
as
applied
to
people
with
incomes
over
$10,000.00
and
one
other
point
is
and
that
is
that
this
question
of
waiver
has
been
thrown
in
to
the
case
somewhat
belatedly
by
the
plaintiffs,
if
you
look
at
the
jurisdictional
statements,
that
did
not
mention
that,
they
just,
mentioned
that
$10,000.00
matter
and
the
mortgage
matter
but,
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
exceed
to
that
certain
expansion.
now
the
main
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
your
honor
is
a
very
difficult
question.
i
think
the
present.
the
important
thing
that
is
going
to
come
out
of
this
case
is
the
precedent
that
will
apply
to
the
future
and
in
applying
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
the
over
10.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
we
have
stated
in
all
of
our
papers
in
this
court
and
even
in
our
motion
to
dismiss,
we
made
a
plan
that
were
arguing
all
constitutional
matters,
because
of
the
fact
that
this
appeal
has
been
made
as
to
the
people
with
over
$10,000.00
and
the
precedent
that
is
laid
down
on
loan
to
consumers
over
$10,000.00
will
as
a
practical
matter
govern
all
transactions,
even
under
10.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
no,
your
honor,
because
there
is
a
case
in
controversy
as
to
consumers
with
incomes
of
over
than
$10,000.00.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
we
are
presenting
that
point
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
they
have
brought
it
up
and
we
are
controverting
their
arguments.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
actually
we
do.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
but
the
matter
is
what
happened
and
we
quarreled
with
it
lately,
but
what
happened
is
the
fact
that
our
clients
ran
out
of
money
and
advised
us
that
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
for
an
appeal
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
we
wrote
and
asked
to
withdraw
at
least
so
stated.
we
wrote
and
asked
to
withdraw
that
the
court
wrote
and
stated
that
we
could
withdraw.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
your
honor,
if
we
have,
if
we
had
realized
that
we
were
going
to
stay
in
the
case,
we
would
have
filed
an
appeal.
it
is
very
unfortunate
we
did
not,
but,
luckily
we
can
still
as
i
see
it
raise
all
these
questions
as
far
as
the
loans
by
our
clients
to
consumers
with
incomes
over
$10,000.00
and
mr.
matz
here
can
certainly
raise
as
far
as
mortgage
loans
to
creditors.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
may
i
continue,
your
honor?
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
now,
the
most
important
controversy
that
appears
between
ourselves
and
the
plaintiffs
is
the
plaintiff's
contention
that
the
burden
of
proof
changed,
that
the
expense
changed,
and
that
the
notice
was
not
sufficient
as
between
proceedings
to
open
a
confessed
judgment
on
the
one
hand
in
an
assumpsit
actions
brought
on
summons
and
complaint.
that
is
absolutely
not
correct,
first
of
all
as
far
as
the
burden
of
proof
is
concerned,
what
the
plaintiffs
has
done
is
to
quote
to
the
court
language
from
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
that
applies
to
cases
that
do
not
involve
promissory
notes,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
because
this
case
involves
entirely
judgments
entered
in
promissory
notes
and
mortgage
bonds
that
mr.
matz
will
handle.
now,
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
we
have
sought
in
our
briefs,
section
33071.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
section
330721
states
that
the
moment,
a
note
is
put
in
–-
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
as
to
all
defenses
other
than
that
of
forgery,
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
others
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendant
in
assumpsit
action.
and
that
of
course,
it
is
the
same
way
on
the
petition
to
open.
the
official
comment
makes
it
plain
and
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
the
burden
of
going
forward
in
the
evidence.
the
comment
makes
it
plain
that
this
is
matter
of
a
burden
of
proof,
then
on
top
of
that,
the
cases
have
held
the
uniform
commercial
code
makes
it
plain
that
section
33071,
that
as
to
forgery
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff
in
an
assumpsit
action
as
a
presumption
of
genuineness
at
the
moment,
some
evidence
is
put
in
as
to
forgery
then
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof,
then
there
is
defense
yank
versus
isenberg
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
and
that
case
specifically
held
that
in
a
confession
proceeding,
the
plaintiff
not
the
defendant
has
the
burden
to
proof
as
to
forgery,
so,
there
is
not
one
difference
in
burden
of
proof
between
a
confession
case
and
an
assumpsit
case.
that
is
the
first
point.
now,
the
second
point
is
that
as
to
the
expense
factor,
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
the
overall
expense
of
assumpsit
action
is
any
less
than
the
overall
expense
of
a
proceeding
to
open
judgment.
there
are
no
studies,
no
surveys,
no
overall,
no
comparisons
of
overall
figures.
i
need
say
no
more
than
that.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
i
am
taking
20.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
oh
i
see!
mr.
matz
will
take
10.
now,
then
on
the
question
of
notice,
the
question
of
notice
is
thoroughly
examined
in
the
rules.
it
is
a
very
technical
matter
and
at
least
20
days
and
generally
many
more
days
between
the
notice
of
entry
of
judgment
and
the
notice
of
execution
in
the
time
when
the
time,
the
sale
can
be
scheduled.
in
the
case
of
an
assumpsit
action,
there
are
20
days
until
a
default
judgment
can
be
entered
and
then
on
the
very
day
or
next
day,
execution
can
issue
--so,
there
really
is
any
difference
of
burden
there.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
the
pennsylvania
rule
say
that
within
20
days
after
the
notice
is
entered
by
confession,
a
notice
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment
and
also
a
notice
of
execution,
when
execution
is
issued
have
to
be
sent
to
the
debtor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
first
of
all,
sale,
the
next
step
is
that
the
notice
of
execution
has
to
issue.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
can
issue
anytime
within
20
days.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
can,
if
it
does
not
issue
with
in
20
days
then
it
can
still
issue
but
after
that
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
in
no
event
can
it
be
put
up,
more
sooner
than
20
days
after
the
sending
of
the
notice
of
the
execution.
the
next
point
is
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
yes,
but
there
are
further
restrictions,
another
restriction
is
that
sales
only
takes
place
once
a
month.
so,
it
is
a
very
rare
case.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
philadelphia
county,
i
understand
that
it
takes
place
once
a
month.
i
do
not
know
about
the
other
counties.
then
the
second
point
is,
that
pennsylvania
rule
say
that,
when
it
is
real
estate,
there
has
to
be
advertising,
weekly
advertising
for
three
successive
weeks
and
it
has
to
be
first
--
and
it
has
to
be
at
least
21
days
before
the
sale,
and
in
case
of
personally,
personally
it
is
six
days.
so,
with
all
these,
all
these
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
these
are
rather
court.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
their
hand
bills
have
to
be
posted
and
they
schedule,
the
timetable
is
a
little
shorter
there
and
hand
bills
have
to
be
posted
and
they
have
to
be
posted
at
least
six
days
ahead
of
time,
in
several
days
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
it
cannot
be
ceased
for
20
more
days,
but,
then
after
that
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
before
it
can
be
sold.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
i
am
not
certain
about
that
your
honor.
i
will
ask
mr.
matz
to
cover
that
point.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
you
do
not
get
a
lien
on
personal
property
by
having
the
judgment,
there
is
some
very
misleading,
in
fact
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
you
can
not
sale
until
you
seize
it.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
you
cannot
sell
it
until
20
days,
i
do
not
want
to
know
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
yes,
i
do
not
know
whether
you
can
seize
it
before
20
days
or
not.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well
then,
also
it
is
customary
to
ask
for
stay
and
the
pennsylvania
rule
state,
they
authorized
the
court
to
grant
a
staid
and
execution.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
it
is
not
automatically
staid--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
no.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
as
possible
as
it
might
be
consistently
with
the
fact
that
the
states
are
always
granted.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
your
honor.
yes
except
if
assuming,
in
99
instances
out
of
the
hundred
on
these
promissory
notes,
there
is
no
defense
and
so
if
an
honest
answer
is
filed,
then
an
immediate
judgment
would
be
taken
other
than
out
of
a
defaulter.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
well
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
it
was
always
my
understanding
that
it
was
and
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
through
the
attorney
general
appeared
and
did
defend
the
constitutionally
of
this
law
in
the
proceedings
below.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
then
there
was
a
change
of
administration
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
two
attorneys
your
honor
who
were
actually
counsel
of
record
for
the
plaintiffs
happen
to
go
up
to
the
attorney
general’s
office
and
then
immediately
after
that
pleading
start
coming
down
with
their
names
corresponds
with
their
names
and
since
then
they
have
been
more
discreet
and
i
have
used
other
names
and
that
is
the
situation
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
we
are
asserting
that
the
district
court’s
decision
was
--
first
of
all
we
are
defending
the
district
court’s
decision
insofar
as
an
attack
is
being
made
on
the
proposition
that
a
knowing
intelligent
and
understanding
waiver
is
invalid.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
it
is
our
contentions
that
since
the
plaintiffs
are
trying
to
extend
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
too,
all
consumer
to
all
loans
by
our
clients
to
consumers
with
incomes
over
$10,000.00
that
insofar
as
we
are
representing
our
clients
as
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
that
we
can,
we
can
go
in
all
questions
of
constitutionality.
the
next
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
oh
i
am
sorry.
that
next
part
of
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
contend
that
the
inadequate
notice
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
you
will
assume,
indicate
why
the
three-judge
court
accepted
that?
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
thank
you
your
honor.
i
represent
the
middle
atlantic
finance
association
and
15
members
of
companies,
who
were
the
intervening
defendants
in
this
action.
and
in
view
of
shortness
of
my
time
because
mr.
matz
here
will
take
10
minutes
after
me,
i
will
not
ask
for
rebuttal.
now,
the
first
question
that
i
would
like
to
cover
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
deferred
hearing
following
judgment
violates
due
process
when
every
opportunity
is
given
to
the
defendant
to
present
every
defense
he
has
and
the
main
contentions
that
are
presented
by
the
plaintiffs
in
that
regard
are
not
that
there
is
anything
inherently
wrongful
with
having
a
deferred
hearing
of
this
sort.
but
they
are
contending
that
it
is
permissible
only
when
there
are
some
overriding
governmental
interests.
and
i
would
merely
like
to
point
out
that
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
on
that
subject,
rebut
that
argument
because
for
example
that
the
coffin
case
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs,
which
was
a
suit
by
the
liquidator
of
an
insolvent
bank
against
its
stockholders
is
certainly
not
a
suit
on
behalf
of
the
government,
it
is
just
an
ordinary
lawsuit
between
a
bank
and
stockholders,
and
that
case
specifically
held
that
even
though
execution
was
an
assessment,
which
is
like
a
judgment
and
also
an
execution
were
issued
before
any
hearing
has
been
held
and
even
though
a
lien
was
acquired
upon
the
stockholders
stock.
nevertheless,
because
the
stockholder
had
a
procedural
opportunity
under
the
georgia
procedure
to
present
all
defenses,
because
he
get
on
the
hearing
before
he
was
actually
deprived
of
that
property
that
that
complied
with
due
process.
there
are
many
other
cases
to
that
affect.
for
example,
there
is
one
case
not
cited
in
the
briefs,
bank
of
colombia
versus
oakley
decided
in
1890
and
17
united
states
233.
now,
that
case
held
likewise
and
there
also
there
was
a
lien
and
i
will
not
burden
your
honors
with
the
description
either
accept
the
state
that
there
was
a
statute
that
provided
that
anytime
a
note
was
payable
at
the
bank,
the
bank
could
go
ahead
and
issue
execution
and
acquire
a
lien
and
but
then
there
would
still
be
a
right
to
a
hearing
afterwards.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
there
is
no
cross-appeal
however
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
the
controversy
is
as
follows,
the
court
below
found
made
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
only
as
to
loans
by
our
clients
to
consumers
with
incomes
of
$10,000.00
or
under
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
the
plaintiffs
here
are
appealing
and
asking
the
court
to
extend
this
decision
to
people
with
income
over
$10,000.00.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
because
the
plaintiffs
are
trying
to,
plainly
represent
people
and
consumers
with
incomes
over
$10,000.00
and
because
we
represent
lenders,
who
are
lending
money
to
people
with
over
$10,000.00
it
is
our
position
that
we
are
entitled
to
argue
all
constitutional
questions
for
that
reason
and
that
is
another
point.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
except
well,
including
that
the
principles
that
were
laid
down
by
the
court
with
respect
to
people
under
$10,000.00
are
wrong
as
applied
to
people
with
incomes
over
$10,000.00
and
one
other
point
is
and
that
is
that
this
question
of
waiver
has
been
thrown
in
to
the
case
somewhat
belatedly
by
the
plaintiffs,
if
you
look
at
the
jurisdictional
statements,
that
did
not
mention
that,
they
just,
mentioned
that
$10,000.00
matter
and
the
mortgage
matter
but,
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
exceed
to
that
certain
expansion.
now
the
main
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
your
honor
is
a
very
difficult
question.
i
think
the
present.
the
important
thing
that
is
going
to
come
out
of
this
case
is
the
precedent
that
will
apply
to
the
future
and
in
applying
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
the
over
10.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
we
have
stated
in
all
of
our
papers
in
this
court
and
even
in
our
motion
to
dismiss,
we
made
a
plan
that
were
arguing
all
constitutional
matters,
because
of
the
fact
that
this
appeal
has
been
made
as
to
the
people
with
over
$10,000.00
and
the
precedent
that
is
laid
down
on
loan
to
consumers
over
$10,000.00
will
as
a
practical
matter
govern
all
transactions,
even
under
10.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
no,
your
honor,
because
there
is
a
case
in
controversy
as
to
consumers
with
incomes
of
over
than
$10,000.00.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
we
are
presenting
that
point
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
they
have
brought
it
up
and
we
are
controverting
their
arguments.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
actually
we
do.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
but
the
matter
is
what
happened
and
we
quarreled
with
it
lately,
but
what
happened
is
the
fact
that
our
clients
ran
out
of
money
and
advised
us
that
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
for
an
appeal
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
we
wrote
and
asked
to
withdraw
at
least
so
stated.
we
wrote
and
asked
to
withdraw
that
the
court
wrote
and
stated
that
we
could
withdraw.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
your
honor,
if
we
have,
if
we
had
realized
that
we
were
going
to
stay
in
the
case,
we
would
have
filed
an
appeal.
it
is
very
unfortunate
we
did
not,
but,
luckily
we
can
still
as
i
see
it
raise
all
these
questions
as
far
as
the
loans
by
our
clients
to
consumers
with
incomes
over
$10,000.00
and
mr.
matz
here
can
certainly
raise
as
far
as
mortgage
loans
to
creditors.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
may
i
continue,
your
honor?
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
now,
the
most
important
controversy
that
appears
between
ourselves
and
the
plaintiffs
is
the
plaintiff's
contention
that
the
burden
of
proof
changed,
that
the
expense
changed,
and
that
the
notice
was
not
sufficient
as
between
proceedings
to
open
a
confessed
judgment
on
the
one
hand
in
an
assumpsit
actions
brought
on
summons
and
complaint.
that
is
absolutely
not
correct,
first
of
all
as
far
as
the
burden
of
proof
is
concerned,
what
the
plaintiffs
has
done
is
to
quote
to
the
court
language
from
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
that
applies
to
cases
that
do
not
involve
promissory
notes,
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
because
this
case
involves
entirely
judgments
entered
in
promissory
notes
and
mortgage
bonds
that
mr.
matz
will
handle.
now,
the
uniform
commercial
code
which
we
have
sought
in
our
briefs,
section
33071.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
section
330721
states
that
the
moment,
a
note
is
put
in
–-
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
as
to
all
defenses
other
than
that
of
forgery,
the
burden
of
going
forward
with
the
others
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendant
in
assumpsit
action.
and
that
of
course,
it
is
the
same
way
on
the
petition
to
open.
the
official
comment
makes
it
plain
and
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
the
burden
of
going
forward
in
the
evidence.
the
comment
makes
it
plain
that
this
is
matter
of
a
burden
of
proof,
then
on
top
of
that,
the
cases
have
held
the
uniform
commercial
code
makes
it
plain
that
section
33071,
that
as
to
forgery
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff
in
an
assumpsit
action
as
a
presumption
of
genuineness
at
the
moment,
some
evidence
is
put
in
as
to
forgery
then
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proof,
then
there
is
defense
yank
versus
isenberg
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
and
that
case
specifically
held
that
in
a
confession
proceeding,
the
plaintiff
not
the
defendant
has
the
burden
to
proof
as
to
forgery,
so,
there
is
not
one
difference
in
burden
of
proof
between
a
confession
case
and
an
assumpsit
case.
that
is
the
first
point.
now,
the
second
point
is
that
as
to
the
expense
factor,
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
the
overall
expense
of
assumpsit
action
is
any
less
than
the
overall
expense
of
a
proceeding
to
open
judgment.
there
are
no
studies,
no
surveys,
no
overall,
no
comparisons
of
overall
figures.
i
need
say
no
more
than
that.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
i
am
taking
20.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
oh
i
see!
mr.
matz
will
take
10.
now,
then
on
the
question
of
notice,
the
question
of
notice
is
thoroughly
examined
in
the
rules.
it
is
a
very
technical
matter
and
at
least
20
days
and
generally
many
more
days
between
the
notice
of
entry
of
judgment
and
the
notice
of
execution
in
the
time
when
the
time,
the
sale
can
be
scheduled.
in
the
case
of
an
assumpsit
action,
there
are
20
days
until
a
default
judgment
can
be
entered
and
then
on
the
very
day
or
next
day,
execution
can
issue
--so,
there
really
is
any
difference
of
burden
there.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
the
pennsylvania
rule
say
that
within
20
days
after
the
notice
is
entered
by
confession,
a
notice
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment
and
also
a
notice
of
execution,
when
execution
is
issued
have
to
be
sent
to
the
debtor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
first
of
all,
sale,
the
next
step
is
that
the
notice
of
execution
has
to
issue.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
can
issue
anytime
within
20
days.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
can,
if
it
does
not
issue
with
in
20
days
then
it
can
still
issue
but
after
that
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
in
no
event
can
it
be
put
up,
more
sooner
than
20
days
after
the
sending
of
the
notice
of
the
execution.
the
next
point
is
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
yes,
but
there
are
further
restrictions,
another
restriction
is
that
sales
only
takes
place
once
a
month.
so,
it
is
a
very
rare
case.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
philadelphia
county,
i
understand
that
it
takes
place
once
a
month.
i
do
not
know
about
the
other
counties.
then
the
second
point
is,
that
pennsylvania
rule
say
that,
when
it
is
real
estate,
there
has
to
be
advertising,
weekly
advertising
for
three
successive
weeks
and
it
has
to
be
first
--
and
it
has
to
be
at
least
21
days
before
the
sale,
and
in
case
of
personally,
personally
it
is
six
days.
so,
with
all
these,
all
these
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
these
are
rather
court.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
their
hand
bills
have
to
be
posted
and
they
schedule,
the
timetable
is
a
little
shorter
there
and
hand
bills
have
to
be
posted
and
they
have
to
be
posted
at
least
six
days
ahead
of
time,
in
several
days
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
it
cannot
be
ceased
for
20
more
days,
but,
then
after
that
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
before
it
can
be
sold.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
i
am
not
certain
about
that
your
honor.
i
will
ask
mr.
matz
to
cover
that
point.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
you
do
not
get
a
lien
on
personal
property
by
having
the
judgment,
there
is
some
very
misleading,
in
fact
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
you
can
not
sale
until
you
seize
it.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
you
cannot
sell
it
until
20
days,
i
do
not
want
to
know
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
yes,
i
do
not
know
whether
you
can
seize
it
before
20
days
or
not.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well
then,
also
it
is
customary
to
ask
for
stay
and
the
pennsylvania
rule
state,
they
authorized
the
court
to
grant
a
staid
and
execution.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
it
is
not
automatically
staid--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
no.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
as
possible
as
it
might
be
consistently
with
the
fact
that
the
states
are
always
granted.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
your
honor.
yes
except
if
assuming,
in
99
instances
out
of
the
hundred
on
these
promissory
notes,
there
is
no
defense
and
so
if
an
honest
answer
is
filed,
then
an
immediate
judgment
would
be
taken
other
than
out
of
a
defaulter.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
well
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
it
was
always
my
understanding
that
it
was
and
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
through
the
attorney
general
appeared
and
did
defend
the
constitutionally
of
this
law
in
the
proceedings
below.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
then
there
was
a
change
of
administration
and
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
two
attorneys
your
honor
who
were
actually
counsel
of
record
for
the
plaintiffs
happen
to
go
up
to
the
attorney
general’s
office
and
then
immediately
after
that
pleading
start
coming
down
with
their
names
corresponds
with
their
names
and
since
then
they
have
been
more
discreet
and
i
have
used
other
names
and
that
is
the
situation
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
we
are
asserting
that
the
district
court’s
decision
was
--
first
of
all
we
are
defending
the
district
court’s
decision
insofar
as
an
attack
is
being
made
on
the
proposition
that
a
knowing
intelligent
and
understanding
waiver
is
invalid.
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
well,
it
is
our
contentions
that
since
the
plaintiffs
are
trying
to
extend
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
too,
all
consumer
to
all
loans
by
our
clients
to
consumers
with
incomes
over
$10,000.00
that
insofar
as
we
are
representing
our
clients
as
to
that
aspect
of
the
case
that
we
can,
we
can
go
in
all
questions
of
constitutionality.
the
next
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
oh
i
am
sorry.
that
next
part
of
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
the
fact
that
the
plaintiffs
contend
that
the
inadequate
notice
--
mr.
philip
c.
patterson
you
will
assume,
indicate
why
the
three-judge
court
accepted
that?
