if
the
court

as
we
now
know
this
rockford
appeal
is
identical
to
the
chicago
one
in
that
the
anti-picketing
ordinances
of
both
cities
were

it
differs
in
some
respects
as

pointed
out
the
city
of

recently
amended
the

by

deleting
the

provided
that
this

does
not
prohibit
the
peaceful

of
any

involved
in

counsel
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
this
represents
the
mission
implied
to
the
city
that
the
anti-picketing

as
originally
passed
was
obviously
unconstitutional.
we
recognize
of
course
that
the
amendment
that
the

rockford
made
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
appellant's
personal
situation.
however
when
we're
talking
about
motivation,
the
counsel
provides
us,
the
fact
is
that
there
could
be
a
question
under
fourteenth

and
the
discriminatory
provisions
of
the
labor

exemption,
there
could
be
and
the
city
of
rockford,
the
city
counsel
felt
as
incidentally
to
other
city
counsels
and
other
school
boards
throughout
the
length
of
this
country
that
if
that
is
the
problem,
we
will
delete
and
we
did
delete
the
labor
dispute
exception.
it
is
by
no
means
an
admission
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
been
violated.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
in
rockford
we
could.
we
have
a
school
board
that
not
too
long
ago
was
co-terminus
with
city.
our
school
board
now
is
completely
a
part
elected
in
different
elections.
i
don't
know
how
the
school
board
is
in
chicago.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
only
way
i
know
--
yes
i
suppose
the
building
traits
during
the
construction
of
the
school
may
have
some
dispute
and
possibly
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well
if
i
were
–
i
were
running
the
labor
union,
my
pickets
would
be
done
at
the
board
of
education
offices,
but
i
think
it's
possible
that
there
could
be
some
labor
dispute.
it's
never
happened
in
our
town,
it
could
happen.
and
i
suppose
it's
possible
and
that's
what
counsel
was
talking
about
possibilities
that
there
could
be
some
pickets
that
use
a
non-union
labor
to
build
eisenhower
school,
for
instance.
ordinarily,
it
wouldn't
have
any
application
to
this
ordinance,
because
it's
confined
while
the
school
is
in
session
and
ordinarily
you
don't
have
the
school
in
session
until
the
school
is
built.
anything
is
possible.
i
have
the
same
question,
that's
about
all
i
can
say.
it
is
improbable
and
the
reason,
one
of
the
reasons
that
our
legislative
body
exempted
disputes
is
frankly
we
had
no
trouble
in
that
connection
and
legislators
being
what
they
are
generally
legislate
towards
some
specific
situation.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
we
copy
the
chicago
ordinance
and
that
very
often
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
identical,
identical.
there
were
three
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
and
i
know
that
the
time
that
this
was
going
to
happen,
i
brought
up
my
own
ordinance.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes,
18.1.
now,
there
is
another
difference
in
that
in
the
rockford
situation
we
have
a
set
of
facts
which
apparently
as
far
as
the
appellant
is
concerned,
did
not
become
important
until
a
couple
of
days
ago.
i
might
add
that
neither
side
of
wrote
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
until
two
days
ago
and
this
occurred
on
april
25th
1969.
there
was
no
demand
made
by
counsel
upon
me
at
any
time
for
a
transcript
and
there
was
no
efforts
made
as
can
be
done
in
illinois
if
we're
talking
about
facts
to
get
an
agreed
statement
of
facts.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
no,
no.
the
only
way
we
know
it
involved
any
people
is
counsel
in
its
brief,
appellant's
brief,
mentions
there
were
200
people
and
now
we
have
the
transcript
of
testimony
and
i
hope
this
case
is
not
going
to
be
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i'm
not
sure
and,
of
course,
the
opinion
in
coates
versus
cincinnati
is
what
gives
me
pause
on
that
whether
this
may
develop
and
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
in
its
application.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes,
it
would.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
frankly
don't
know.
in
coates
versus
cincinnati
apparently,
i
think
you
yourself
had
some
questions
about
whether
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
that
is
right,
and
picketing,
of
course,
is
not
strictly
a
speech
case.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
personally
be
willing
to
stand
on
the
ordinance
as
right
and
although
we
had
200
people,
we
had
four
(inaudible)
disturbance
and
mosley
was
just
walking
up
and
down
all
by
himself.
i
suppose
that
one
has
to
trust
somewhat
into
the
discretion
of
the
school
administration.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
fair,
but
i
can
see
where
this
court
might
take
that
attitude.
we
did
have
200
people
and
we
had
disruption
and
when
counsel
speaks
from
this
transcript,
apparently
she
and
i
may
not
have
the
same
transcript,
but
the
one
i
have
indicates
that
there
was
disruption
of
things
came
to
halt
inside
the
school
about
three,
four
hours.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
grayned?
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
that's
in
the
record
before
you
is
the
transcript
that
we
are
submitting
to
you,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
what's
in
the
record
before
you,
nothing,
absolutely
nothing.
what's
in
the
transcript?
again,
there
seems
to
be
some
questions
as
to
what's
in
the
transcript.
i
read
it
last
night
carefully,
grayned
without
any
question
was
a
member
of
the
200
people
that
were
going
up
and
down
sidewalk.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
there
to
my
knowledge
is
no
direct
--
the
testimony
was
everybody
was
chatting.
there
was
no
direct
testimony
to
my
knowledge
that
grayned
was
chanting.
this
was
a
group
of
200
people.
there
is
testimony
that
he
was,
i
think,
demonstrating
or
raising
his
hand.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
because
the
anti-noise,
anti-picketing,
not
anti-demonstration
ordinance
says
whosoever
shall
willfully
make
noise
or
demonstrate
as
to
disrupt
the
classroom.
it
leads,
who
shall
willfully
may
or
assist
in
the
making
of
any
noise
or
diversion
which
tends,
which
disturbs
or
tends
to
disturb
the
peace
and
good
order
of
such
school
session
or
class
there
off.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
there
was
testimony
that
grayned,
this
one
particular
defendant
was
walking
up
and
down.
i
believe
some
people
said
he
had
sign,
some
didn't.
there
was
testimony
that
everybody
was
chanting
and
of
course,
there
is
testimony
by
various
school
teachers
that
things
sort
of
stopped
inside
for
a
long
period
once
they
started.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
deaf
and
dumb,
i
doubt
that
he
would
be
convicted
if
he
showed
that
he
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
he
couldn't
because
he
was
dumb.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
think
not.
we
read
the
record
and
now
we
talk
about
the
transcript,
not
the
record
before
this
court,
grayned
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
you
have
one
man
and
you
have
a
ordinance.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir,
i
understand.
if
we
get
into
finding
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
incidentally
took
two
whole
days
to
trial,
there
is
controverted
testimony
first.
mr.
grayned
said,
i
just
happen
to
be
there
and
the
police
came
along
and
put
me
and
then
this
--
and
all
of
the
testimony
is
controverted,
i
am
speaking
about
the
city's
testimony
and
the
two
(inaudible)
the
jury.
the
jury
found
one,
that
grayned
was
guilty
to
anti-picketing;
two,
they
found
him
guilty
of
making
a
diversion,
not
a
noise.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
--
this
was
brought
up
there.
now
this
isn't
just
a
diversion
if
the
court
please,
but
it
is
a
diversion
willfully
make
or
assist
in
the
making
of
any
diversion
which
tends,
disturbs,
or
tends
to
disturb
the
peace
and
good
order
of
such
school
while
it's
in
session,
that's
how
the
ordinance
reads.
as
to
the
definition
of
diversion,
i
believe
the
illinois
supreme
court
took
that
up,
specifically
the
word
itself
and
i
hope
i
can
find
it
immediately
or
in
--
it
said,
we
do
observe
while
the
defendant
charges
that
the
terms
appearing
in
the
ordinance
such
as
noise
and
diversion
--
i
am
reading
from
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion,
lack
of
constitutional
precision
and
are
two
indefinite
common
terms
such
as
alarmed,
disturbed,
interfered
with
and
hindered,
have
been
determined
to
comply
with
the
constitutional
requirements
of
mississippi.
the
terms
here
are
not
constitutionally
objectionable.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
jury
was
instructed
and
the
words
of
the
ordinance.
i
don't
think
they
were
instructed
on
a
dictionary
definition
of
diversion.
it
occurs
to
me
though,
however,
a
diversion
to
divert
to
take
from
the
normal
course
where
you
have
testimony
that
a
good
part
of
the
students
spend
most
of
the
day
looking
out
the
windows
instead
of
studying,
i
think
diversion
in
the
context
to
this
ordinance
is
they
are
diverted
from
the
usual
procedure
that
goes
on
in
school,
namely
learning
and
teaching
i
assume.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
colloquy
concerning
instructions
are
in
this
transcript
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
--
and
there
is
no
point
that
i
know
of
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
nor
in
the
magistrate's
court,
however,
i
didn't
try
the
case
but
it
does
not
appear
here
and
it
does
appear
in
this
transcript
the
discussion
concerning
instructions
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
so
probably
it
didn't
occur,
at
least
it
wasn't
recorded.
now
i
see
my
time
has
almost
expired.
it
seems
to
me
basically
that
the
rockford
ordinances
do
not
differ
greatly
from
the
ordinance
of
the
second
cox
case,
both
the
ordinances.
they
are
specific
as
to
place,
a
150
feet
is
quite
definite
and
incidentally
reasonable.
15
feet
wouldn't
help
much
and
1,500
feet
probably
would
be
too
far.
the
specific
as
to
time,
and
incidentally
the
anti-noise,
anti-diversion
ordinance
says
around
adjacent
to
the
school,
the
school
property
not
the
building,
the
picketing
ordinance,
the
measurement
starts
at
the
building,
not
the
property.
spatially
these
are
specific,
i
think
these
ordinances
can
be.
the
standpoint
at
time
they
are
both
restricted
as
to
a
little
different
however,
the
picketing
ordinance,
a
half
hour
before
and
after
schools
in
session,
the
anti-noise
and
diversion
ordinance
while
school
is
in
session
or
if
they
have
a
meeting
anytime
during
the
day
and
night,
when
a
meeting
is
being
held
in
the
school
house.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
none.
i
think
that
the
--
and
in
the
preamble
of
the
anti-noise
ordinance
is
for
the
protection
of
schools.
so
that
the
educational
process
will
continue
uninterruptedly,
that's
the
rationale
of
both
ordinances
and
they
were
passed
just
for
that
purpose
and
for
no
other
purpose.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan

as

cincinnati
apparently,
i
think
you
yourself
had
some
questions
about
whether
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
that
is
right,
and
picketing,
of
course,
is
not
strictly
a
speech
case.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
personally
be
willing
to
stand
on
the
ordinance
as
right
and
although
we
had
200
people,
we
had
four
(inaudible)
disturbance
and
mosley
was
just
walking
up
and
down
all
by
himself.
i
suppose
that
one
has
to
trust
somewhat
into
the
discretion
of
the
school
administration.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
fair,
but
i
can
see
where
this
court
might
take
that
attitude.
we
did
have
200
people
and
we
had
disruption
and
when
counsel
speaks
from
this
transcript,
apparently
she
and
i
may
not
have
the
same
transcript,
but
the
one
i
have
indicates
that
there
was
disruption
of
things
came
to
halt
inside
the
school
about
three,
four
hours.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
grayned?
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
that's
in
the
record
before
you
is
the
transcript
that
we
are
submitting
to
you,
sir.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
well,
what's
in
the
record
before
you,
nothing,
absolutely
nothing.
what's
in
the
transcript?
again,
there
seems
to
be
some
questions
as
to
what's
in
the
transcript.
i
read
it
last
night
carefully,
grayned
without
any
question
was
a
member
of
the
200
people
that
were
going
up
and
down
sidewalk.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
there
to
my
knowledge
is
no
direct
--
the
testimony
was
everybody
was
chatting.
there
was
no
direct
testimony
to
my
knowledge
that
grayned
was
chanting.
this
was
a
group
of
200
people.
there
is
testimony
that
he
was,
i
think,
demonstrating
or
raising
his
hand.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
because
the
anti-noise,
anti-picketing,
not
anti-demonstration
ordinance
says
whosoever
shall
willfully
make
noise
or
demonstrate
as
to
disrupt
the
classroom.
it
leads,
who
shall
willfully
may
or
assist
in
the
making
of
any
noise
or
diversion
which
tends,
which
disturbs
or
tends
to
disturb
the
peace
and
good
order
of
such
school
session
or
class
there
off.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
there
was
testimony
that
grayned,
this
one
particular
defendant
was
walking
up
and
down.
i
believe
some
people
said
he
had
sign,
some
didn't.
there
was
testimony
that
everybody
was
chanting
and
of
course,
there
is
testimony
by
various
school
teachers
that
things
sort
of
stopped
inside
for
a
long
period
once
they
started.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
deaf
and
dumb,
i
doubt
that
he
would
be
convicted
if
he
showed
that
he
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
he
couldn't
because
he
was
dumb.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
think
not.
we
read
the
record
and
now
we
talk
about
the
transcript,
not
the
record
before
this
court,
grayned
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
you
have
one
man
and
you
have
a
ordinance.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
yes
sir,
i
understand.
if
we
get
into
finding
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
incidentally
took
two
whole
days
to
trial,
there
is
controverted
testimony
first.
mr.
grayned
said,
i
just
happen
to
be
there
and
the
police
came
along
and
put
me
and
then
this
--
and
all
of
the
testimony
is
controverted,
i
am
speaking
about
the
city's
testimony
and
the
two
(inaudible)
the
jury.
the
jury
found
one,
that
grayned
was
guilty
to
anti-picketing;
two,
they
found
him
guilty
of
making
a
diversion,
not
a
noise.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
--
this
was
brought
up
there.
now
this
isn't
just
a
diversion
if
the
court
please,
but
it
is
a
diversion
willfully
make
or
assist
in
the
making
of
any
diversion
which
tends,
disturbs,
or
tends
to
disturb
the
peace
and
good
order
of
such
school
while
it's
in
session,
that's
how
the
ordinance
reads.
as
to
the
definition
of
diversion,
i
believe
the
illinois
supreme
court
took
that
up,
specifically
the
word
itself
and
i
hope
i
can
find
it
immediately
or
in
--
it
said,
we
do
observe
while
the
defendant
charges
that
the
terms
appearing
in
the
ordinance
such
as
noise
and
diversion
--
i
am
reading
from
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion,
lack
of
constitutional
precision
and
are
two
indefinite
common
terms
such
as
alarmed,
disturbed,
interfered
with
and
hindered,
have
been
determined
to
comply
with
the
constitutional
requirements
of
mississippi.
the
terms
here
are
not
constitutionally
objectionable.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
jury
was
instructed
and
the
words
of
the
ordinance.
i
don't
think
they
were
instructed
on
a
dictionary
definition
of
diversion.
it
occurs
to
me
though,
however,
a
diversion
to
divert
to
take
from
the
normal
course
where
you
have
testimony
that
a
good
part
of
the
students
spend
most
of
the
day
looking
out
the
windows
instead
of
studying,
i
think
diversion
in
the
context
to
this
ordinance
is
they
are
diverted
from
the
usual
procedure
that
goes
on
in
school,
namely
learning
and
teaching
i
assume.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
the
colloquy
concerning
instructions
are
in
this
transcript
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
--
and
there
is
no
point
that
i
know
of
--
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
nor
in
the
magistrate's
court,
however,
i
didn't
try
the
case
but
it
does
not
appear
here
and
it
does
appear
in
this
transcript
the
discussion
concerning
instructions
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
so
probably
it
didn't
occur,
at
least
it
wasn't
recorded.
now
i
see
my
time
has
almost
expired.
it
seems
to
me
basically
that
the
rockford
ordinances
do
not
differ
greatly
from
the
ordinance
of
the
second
cox
case,
both
the
ordinances.
they
are
specific
as
to
place,
a
150
feet
is
quite
definite
and
incidentally
reasonable.
15
feet
wouldn't
help
much
and
1,500
feet
probably
would
be
too
far.
the
specific
as
to
time,
and
incidentally
the
anti-noise,
anti-diversion
ordinance
says
around
adjacent
to
the
school,
the
school
property
not
the
building,
the
picketing
ordinance,
the
measurement
starts
at
the
building,
not
the
property.
spatially
these
are
specific,
i
think
these
ordinances
can
be.
the
standpoint
at
time
they
are
both
restricted
as
to
a
little
different
however,
the
picketing
ordinance,
a
half
hour
before
and
after
schools
in
session,
the
anti-noise
and
diversion
ordinance
while
school
is
in
session
or
if
they
have
a
meeting
anytime
during
the
day
and
night,
when
a
meeting
is
being
held
in
the
school
house.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
none.
i
think
that
the
--
and
in
the
preamble
of
the
anti-noise
ordinance
is
for
the
protection
of
schools.
so
that
the
educational
process
will
continue
uninterruptedly,
that's
the
rationale
of
both
ordinances
and
they
were
passed
just
for
that
purpose
and
for
no
other
purpose.
i
believe
my
time
is
up.
mr.
william
r.
quinlan
i
thank
you
very
much.
