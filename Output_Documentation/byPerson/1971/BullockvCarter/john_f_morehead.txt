mr.
john
f.
morehead
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
john
morehead,
and
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
democratic
party
of
the
state
of
texas.
this
case
involves
a
constitutionality
of
political
party
filing
fees
as
an
absolute
prerequisite
to
getting
on
the
primary
ballot.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
duly
constituted
three-judged
court.
the
court
below
held
that
filing
fees
violate
the
first
amendment,
the
due
process
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
when
used
either
as
a
revenue
collecting
device
or
when
made
an
absolute
requirement
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot.
there
were
intervenors
in
this
case
who
desired
to
vote
for
the
candidates
who
did
not
have
the
filing
fee.
judge
taylor
writing
for
the
three-judge
court
decided
that
since
the
intervenors
wanted
to
vote
for
these
particular
candidates
that
this
was
really
a
voter’s
rights
case,
and
that
therefore,
in
order
for
the
state
to
sustain
its
laws,
we
had
to
meet
the
burden
of
showing
a
compelling
state
interest.
our
position
is
that
the
primary
question
before
this
court,
is
whether
or
not
the
traditional
rational
relation
test
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
this
factual
situation
or
whether
or
not
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
in
order
to
sustain
its
laws.
to
begin
with,
let
me
say
that
i
consider
the
issues
involved
in
a
nominating
primary
or
political
party,
to
be
different
from
those
issues
which
are
involved
in
a
general
election.
the
reasoning
of
mr.
justice
stewart
in
turner
against
fouche,
i
think
that
is
the
correct
pronunciation,
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
a
filing
fee
is
an
absolute
prerequisite
to
stand
for
office
in
a
general
election
would
amount
to
invidious
discrimination.
the
first
question
to
be
decided
here
today
is
whether
or
not
the
primary
should
be
treated
exactly
like
a
general
election.
there
is
language
in
the
1944
case,
smith
against
allwright
with
which
mr.
justice
marshall
is
very
familiar,
which
indicates
that
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
and
smith,
mr.
justice
reed
said,
when
primaries
became
a
part
of
the
machinery
for
choosing
officials,
state
and
national
as
they
have
here,
the
same
test
to
determine
the
character
of
discrimination
as
a
abridgment
should
be
applied
to
the
primary
as
are
applied
to
the
general
election.
the
court
in
smith
was
talking
about
a
state
statute
which
fenced
off
the
rights
of
otherwise
qualified
black
voters
to
participate
in
the
democratic
primary.
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
smith,
many
cases
have
came
before
this
court
which
involved
both
voter
rights
and
candidate
rights.
the
issues
and
problems
have
been
definitionally
refined
to
the
extent
that
i
think
that
if
smith
were
to
come
before
this
court
today,
i
believe
that
this
court
would
probably,
would
obviously
reach
the
same
result,
but
would
probably
use
a
little
bit
different
wording
than
it
was
used
in
smith.
i
feel
like
that
it
would
be
much
more
similar
to,
for
example
the
case
of
kramer
versus
the
union
free
school
district.
in
order
to
get
an
accurate
perspective
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
a
brief
sketch
of
how
texas
election
systems
work
will
be
helpful
to
the
court.
primaries
are
held
in
may,
and
under
the
laws
as
it
exists
today,
the
payment
of
the
fee
is
an
absolute
requirement
to
get
on
the
ballot,
no
write-ins
at
all
are
permitted
on
the
primary
ballot.
in
november,
the
election
is
free,
no
fees
are
charged
at
all
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
everyone.
you
can
only
vote,
and
either
there
is
a
law
which
says
you
can
only
vote
in
a
democratic
primary
or
in
republican
primary,
but
all
qualified
voters
are
eligible
to
vote
in
a
primary
election.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
no
sir,
they
do
not.
at
the
top
of
the
ballot
is
printed
the
words
which
say
that
i
pledge
to
support
the
nominees,
but
of
course
no
way
that
could
ever
be
imposed.
and
also
in
our
november
election,
we
have
a
much,
much
easier
method
for
independent
candidates
or
independent
parties
to
get
on
the
ballot
then
the
court
was
faced
with
in
the
recent
case
of
jenness
against
fortson,
there,
this
court
held
that
5%
was
alright.
in
texas,
it
is
1%
of
the
people
for
state
wide
election,
and
for
local
elections,
it
is
also
1%
except
there
is
an
absolute
maximum,
it
cannot
ever
have
to
have
more
than
500
signatures
in
order
to
get
on
the
november
ballot.
and
so,
as
the
court
is
aware,
this
is
a
consolidated
case
involving
three
different
candidates
who
desire
to
get
on
the
election.
the
two
local
candidates,
the
one
for
county
judge
in
fort
worth
and
the
one
for
county
commissioner
out
in
el
paso,
both
of
which
counties
have
populations
in
excess
of
300,000
people
only
needed
500
people
on
a
petition
in
order
to
get
on
the
november
ballot.
we
think
that
a
primary
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
no.
you
just
get
1%
of
the
people
that
want
to
support
an
independent
candidate.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
1%
of
eligible
voters,
not
1%
of
the
people
that
voted
in
the
last
election,
but
1%
of
the
eligible
voters.
now,
the
state
thinks
that
a
political
primary
is
an
extension
of
the
right
to
vote,
similar
to
which
this
court
was
faced
in
the
mcdonald
case
involving
the
absentee
ballot
for
the
inmates
of
the
cook
county
prison.
in
a
primary,
you
get
to
vote
a
second
time,
not
only
do
you
get
to
vote
in
november,
but
you
also
get
an
opportunity
to
vote
in
may.
and
we
therefore
submit
that
this
is
an
extension
as
also
you
can
see
that
a
candidate
gets
the
right
to
run
twice.
for
example,
mary
lindsay
lost
in
the
republican
primary
for
the
mayor
of
new
york
and
was
able
to
come
back
as
an
independent
in
november
and
still
win
the
election.
we
submit
that
the
footnote
in
kramer
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
which
points
out
the
distinction
between
fencing
off
case
as
happened
in
kramer,
where
the
man
was
not
eligible
to
vote
at
all,
and
the
type
of
case
that
you
have
in
mcdonald,
which
is
an
extension
of
the
voting
rights
is
a
distinction
which
this
court
should
apply
in
this
case,
and
that
the
three-judge
court
when
they
applied
the
rational
relation
test,
i
mean,
when
they
applied
the
compelling
state
interest
test
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas,
just
simply
used
the
wrong
test
and
that
therefore,
if
it
were
not
for
the
press
of
the
fact
that
we
have
new
primaries
coming
up
in
1972
and
new
deadlines
to
meet
that
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case
is
really
a
remand
to
the
three-judge
court
to
apply
the
proper
test
to
the
texas
laws.
we
submit
of
course
that
the
rational
relation
test
is
the
one
which
this
court
should
use.
now,
even
applying
a
rational
relation
test,
we
are
still
faced
with
the
problem
of
does
this
filing
fee
as
an
absolute
requirement
to
get
on
a
primary
ballot,
which
is
a
part
of
the
election
process
constitute
invidious
discrimination.
if
the
rational
relation
test
applies,
then
we
submit
that
the
court
could
look,
should
look
to
the
other
side
of
the
question,
and
what
purposes
does
the
fee
serve.
the
fee
serves
two
purposes
to
the
state
of
texas.
first,
it
serves
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
ballot
and
secondly,
it
serves
the
purpose
of
financing
the
actual
cost
of
the
election
itself.
in
other
words,
the
candidates
pay
all
the
cost
of
printing
of
the
ballots,
paying
the
voting
officials,
all
of
the
other
incidental
things,
renting
a
place
for
use
of
the
public
schools,
most
of
the
time
to
hold
the
elections
in,
getting
the
pencils,
renting
the
voting
machines
from
the
county
and
all
of
these
matters.
this
is
taxed
to
the
candidates,
and
not
to
the
states.
on
the
face
of
this,
both
of
these
reasons
would
appear
legitimate,
but
we
still
must
look
to
the
question
of
whether
they
have
the
effect
of
classifying
an
effectually
excluding
from
the
electoral
process,
people
who
are
unable
to
pay
for
the
fee.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
to
me,
inherent
in
our
constitution,
both
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
state
constitution,
we
have
an
elective
process,
that
is
the
way
we
select.
our
public
officials
is
through
election.
the
ultimate
election
since
that
is
the
way
we
are
going
to
run
our
government;
it
seems
to
me
must
be
borne,
the
cost
of
that
must
be
borne
by
the
state.
and
that
someone
who
is
unable
to
pay
the
fee
there
mr.
justice,
obviously
must
have
the
opportunity
to
stand
for
ultimate
election,
and
it
might
be
a
legitimate
purpose
to
have
finance
it
that
way,
but
you
certainly
could
not
exclude
someone
from
a
general
election
in
november
because
of
his
inability
to
pay
this
fee.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
well,
it
seems
to
me
that,
first
we
need
to
look
historically
at
the
problem
of
the
primaries.
primaries
worked
there
when
we
first
started
holding
elections
in
this
country
and
as
i
understand
it,
some
states
still
nominate
through,
through
convention
as
opposed
to
through
primary,
and
the
fact
that
someone
is
unable
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
the
primary
election,
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
cannot
get
elected,
whereas
if
he
is
unable
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
november,
the
door
is
closed,
he
is
foreclosed
of
any
possibility
for
election.
does
that
respond
sir?
that
is
the
response
i
have.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
have
been
thinking
on
the
problem
instead
of
the
attack.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
in
terms
of
total
cost,
it
is
not
sir.
the
reason
being
that
in
texas
we
hold
two
primary
elections,
and
only
one
general
election
and
therefore
you
got
to
have
two
sets
of
officials,
and
if
you
are
going
to
hold
them
in
different
places,
and
two
sets
of
ballot
boxes
for
example
or
two
sets
of
voting
machines,
where
as
in
the
general
election,
you
do
not
have
to
hold
one
of
these.
one
of
the
problems
which
i
think
needs
to
be
considered
if
the
rational
relation
test
does
apply,
what
are
the
alternatives?
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
not
the
ultimate
right
to
run,
no
sir,
i
do
not
think.
i
mean,
i
do
think
the
first
amendment
does
protect
the
ultimate
right
to
run
for
a
state
office.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
not
that
i
have
seen,
but
it
does
an
abstract
proposition.
i
would
think
that
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
would
get
the
first
amendment
back
in
and
apply
into
the
states
on
that,
i
am
saying
that
correctly.
what
the
three-judge
court
based
their
reasoning
on
sir,
was
this,
they
said
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
right,
they
said
that
this
was
a
voter
right
question,
since
voters
wanted
to
vote
for
a
particular
candidate
that
therefore
this
was
a
voter
question
and
not
a
candidate
question,
and
that
therefore
the
right
to
speak
as
vote.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
would
have
thought
that
it
probably
was.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
just
have
to
be
frank
and
say
that
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
on
the
first
question,
i
would
think
so,
but
i
must
plead
ignorance
to
that.
if
we
want
to
find
this
another
way
to
regulate
the
size
of
our
primary
ballot
other
than
fees,
we
are
reduced
ultimately
i
think
to
a
petition
which
to
me,
in
other
words
you
have
to
show
some
sort
of
modicrum
of
support
in
order
to
get
on
the
primary
ballot
because
otherwise,
you
face
the
very
real
problem
of
500
people
filing
for
the
office
of
governor
of
the
state
of
texas,
that
it
is
not
quite
the
same
problem
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
williams
against
rhodes,
there
he
talked
about
the
theoretical
possibility
of
the
proliferation,
if
i
can
get
all
those
words,
either
political
parties
and
i
think
that
the
theoretical
possibility
of
proliferation
of
candidates
is
a
much
more
real
problem
than
the
possibility
of
having
a
whole
lot
of
political
parties.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir,
they
do.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
some
do
it
by
petition,
others
have
just
not
ever
met
the
problem.
the
most
serious
situation
i
think
arose
in
the
state
of
michigan
one
time
where
they
did
end
up
with
700
people
on
a
primary
ballot.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir,
it
certainly
can.
it
is
expensive
to
hold
an
election.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
well,
for
the
district
judge's
office
which
is
a
county
office
in
the
larger
metropolitan
areas.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes,
it
is
the
county
committee.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes,
the
particular
party
committee.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
each
year
they
set
them
on
their
own
original
basis
and
this
particular
case,
this
$9,000
fee
to
file
for
district
judge,
what
they
do
is
try
to
collect
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
election
and
after
it
is
over,
they
rebate
the
excess
proportionately
depending
on
what
fee
you
pay.
in
this
particular
case,
they
rebated
57%.
in
other
words,
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
bottom
up,
they
invested
more
than
100%
on
the
amount
that
and
there
i
think
that
if
a
candidate
come
in
to
the
state
court
and
said
that
this
particular
county
chairman
or
this
particular
county
committee
abused
their
discretion
and
the
amount
of
this
fee
they
set,
i
think
you
have
got
some
redress
in
the
court
of
the
state
of
texas
in
that
matter.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
that
is
right,
ultimately
they
just
paid
for
the
actual
cost,
and
ultimately
all
of
them
divided
on
the
amount
of
payment.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
that
is
correct
sir.
they
always
try
to
get
more
because
for
a
losing
candidate
they
have
particular
amount
of
trouble
collecting
money
from
him.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
a
better
way
to
ask
that
would
be
how
many
were
unopposed,
and
in
tarrant
county
i
think
there
are
eight.
the
people
from
tarrant
county
can
answer
that
question.
i
think
all,
but
one
of
them
was
actually
unopposed
in
the
democratic
primary.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
two.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes.
the
unopposed
candidates.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
the
district
judge’s
salary
would
be
about,
there
is
two
different
ways
you
pay
for
it,
one,
the
state
pays
a
basic
amount
which
is
now
21,000
and
many
counties
vote
an
additional
emolument,
most
of
them
rounding
up
to
about
25,000.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
the
term
is
four
years.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
think
there
is
one
example
of
that
where
there
is
a
county,
where
there
was
a
$50
fee
and
he
do
not
get
paid
any
dime.
but
that
is
the
basic
fee
that
each
person
has
to
pay
$50
filling
fee
and
then
later
on
after
you
find
out
how
many
contested
races
you
have
and
how
many
candidates
you
have,
then
after
the
filing
deadline
is
when
there
is
additional
assessment
is
leveled.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir,
but
these
fees
are
different.
the
legislator
or
is
the
one
that
passes
these
laws,
and
so
therefore,
the
cost
to
run
for
a
statewide
office
somehow
seems
to
be
less
than
it
does
to
run
for
the
others
and
the
counsel
for
mr.
pate
(ph)
have
said
that
this
is
a
discrimination
in
itself.
they
charge
$150
to
run
for
the
state
legislator,
$1,000
to
run
for
governor,
that
is
the
maximum
for
statewide
office
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
not
to
the
state.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes.
to
the
secretary
of
state,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
right.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
right.
the
other
alternative
that
i
would
like
to
pose
before
i
sit
down
is,
if
the
candidates
do
not
finance
these
party
primaries,
who
must
finance
it?
the
other
alternative
is
that
of
course,
you
need
to
make
the
counties
and
state
itself
finance
these
particular
elections.
and
to
say
that
the
states
must
themselves
finance
it,
and
that
that
is
part
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
quite
a
different
thing
as
saying
that
the
legislator
can
finance
it
itself,
if
it
so
desires.
in
other
words,
to
say
that
the
state
must
finance
it,
is
to
say
that
somewhere
in
the
equal
protection
clause,
there
is
some
sort
of
affirmative
language
which
says
that
the
state
must
act,
that
the
state
must
hold
this
primary
election
and
finance
it
themselves.
because
i
think
that
ultimately
that
whether
it
is
$50
filing
fee
or
$0.05
filing
fee
or
$9,000
filing
fee,
that
the
filing
fee
itself,
because
you
are
always
going
to
run
into
that
one
person
or
that
group
of
people
that
the
$50
is
just
as
important
to
as
or
the
$5
would
be
just
as
important
or
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
harper
that,
that
the
$1.75
on
virginia,
poll
tax
does
not
really
have
any
valid
relation
to
the
man’s
ability
and
right
and
qualifications
to
stand
for
all
this
or
to
vote
for
that
particular
matter.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
no
sir.
in
their
opinion,
the
court
said
that
it
is
unconstitutional
on
two
respects.
number
one,
it
cannot
be
used,
they
used
the
word
revenue
raising
device.
it
is
not
a
revenue-raising
device
in
the
sense
that
it
goes
into
the
state
conference
like
the
school,
the
poll
tax
is
used
just
to
pay
the
cost.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
if
they
said
you
could
not
use
filing
fees
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
election
and
number
two,
they
said
it
could
not
be
made
an
absolute
requirement
to
get
on
the
ballot.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
read
it
that
way,
yes.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
when
you
see
the
requirement
that
our
state
legislator
put
on
the
affidavit
of
indigency
in
their
last
legislation,
that
is
obviously
got
to
be
bad,
i
mean
that
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
always
had
reference
sir
to
looking
at,
i
am
looking
at
the
jurisdictional
statement,
which
is
where
the
opinion
is
printed
at
the
page
10a
in
the
back.
the
top
sentence,
the
court.
now
he
says,
in
the
second
sentence,
we
have
limited
our
decision
here
to
say
that
a
filing
fee
violates
the
first
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause,
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
it
is
used
as
a
revenue
collecting
device,
that
is
what
i
thought
the
court
really
held.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir,
and
squarely
on
the
voting
rights
problem
as
opposed
to
the
candidate
right
problem.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
that
is
correct,
i
see,
if
we
have
a
first
amendment
problem
and
a
compelling
state
interest
problem,
then
these
statutes
ultimately
must
fall,
i
think
that
is
the
really
proper
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
no
sir,
i
do
not.
i
will
research
this
problem
and
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
$0.10
fee,that
is
the
way
i
read
it.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
that
is
right.
that
is
what
i
really
ultimately
--
i
did
not
think
that,
that
is
what
they
are
really
resting
it
on
since
they
had
set
it
back
at
first
and
it
is
just
a
guess
there
to
answer
that
question.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
believe
that
broadly
stated
the
issue
here
is
whether
there
should
be
the
opportunity
for
equal
participation
in
the
electoral
process
by
candidates,
with
or
without
money?
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
will
restate
it,
i
believe
broadly
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
there
should
be
the
opportunity
for
equal
participation
in
the
electoral
process
by
candidates.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
no.
should
i
continue
or
wait?
mr.
john
f.
morehead
alright.
broadly
stated
your
honors,
i
believe
the
issue
here
is
whether
there
should
be
the
opportunity
for
equal
participation
in
the
electoral
process
by
candidates
with
or
without
money
or
who
refuse
to
pay.
i
do
not
believe
that,
and
i
do
not
fully
concur
with
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court.
i
think
that
opinion
is
too
reserved
and
too
conservative
in
our
political
way
of
life,
in
our
democratic
political
way
of
life.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
the
reason
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
well,
the
reasoning,
mr.
chief
justices,
what
i
disagree
with
and
that
it
limited
only
on
first
amendment
rights,
what
i
am
saying.
my
position
is
that
the
right
to
run
to
office
is
as
much
a
fundamental
right
as
the
right
to
vote,
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
guarantees
political
association
and
that
that
right
should
not
be
impinged
upon.
that
is
my
position
and
i
think
that
if
that
is
followed,
it
would
eliminate
exactly
what
is
happening
in
texas
under
this
system,
and
that
is
a
monopoly
in
government
itself
is
what
exists
down
there.
there
is
a
monopoly
because
it
is
a
government
by
the
selected,
for
the
selected
and
now
the
selected.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
crux
of
the
issue
is
whether
the
classification
here
which
limits
the
right
to
vote
or
seek
public
office
as
a
candidate
is
per
se
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
which
is
the
rights
of
freedom
of
political
association
and
equal
protection.
the
candidate,
i
am
speaking
for
the
voter’s
rights
as
well
as
of
candidate’s
rights.
this
was,
like
in
rhodes,
there,
there
was
discrimination
between
parties
and
in
that
case,
as
justice
white
inquired,
is
there
a
case
from
this
court
that
talks
about
first
amendment
rights
in
connection
with
the
right
to
run
to
office,
and
it
did.
that
is
the
case
where
they
talked
about
first
amendment
rights
as
a
right
to
run
to
office.
i
agree
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
permits
the
states
to
make
classifications
and
it
does
not
require
them
to
treat
them
uniformly.
nevertheless,
it
bans
any
invidious
discrimination
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
involved
in
this
case,
invidious
discrimination,
unfair
discrimination.
the
primary
election
is
an
organ
of
the
state
and
as
stated
in
that
case
by
in
allwright
case,
when
primaries
become
a
part
of
the
machinery
for
choosing
official
state
and
national
as
they
have
here,
the
same
task
to
determine
the
character
of
discrimination
to
be
applied
to
the
primaries
as
they
are
applied
to
the
general
election.
the
general
election,
your
honors
and
mr.
chief
justice
merely
confirm
the
discrimination
that
exists
in
the
primaries.
and
the
alternate
about
petitions
for
independent
is
not
a
reality
in
the
political
life.
in
fact,
in
checking
that
section
of
the
law,
those
people
that
voted
in
the
primary
cannot
sign
those
petitions
for
candidates,
non-partisan
candidates
that
run
in
the
general
election.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
make
the
opposite
statement.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
differently,
but
we
have
checked
and
i
was
prepared
for
this
and
if
you
will
check
it,
i
believe
i
am
correct.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
do
not
have
it
with
me,
i
have
is
1305,
i
believe
13.50,
so
this
is
not
like
georgia
and
portison
(ph),
justice
stewart
where
the
election
process
was
wide
open.
this
is
freezing
in
the
status
quo,
the
ins
are
ins
and
the
outs
are
out.
and
that
is
why
there
is
no
opposition,
and
this
country
is
based
on
the
political
fluidity
i
believe
they
say
in
the
electoral
process
as
what
this
court
is
very
concerned
with,
that
it
is
maintained
and
that
is
just
what
this
filing
fee
system
prevents.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
correct,
and
those
concepts
of
course
eroded.
just
like
snowden
versus
hughes,
there
is
no
longer
the
law
in
this
court,
in
the
incorporation
theory
from
the
first
amendment
into
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that
is
why
i
say
snowden
is
not
the
controller
in
this
case,
what
so
ever.
it
is
totally
inapplicable
to
the
fact
situation
and
onto
the
brought
principles
of
law
that
i
have
believed
should
apply
to
deciding
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
it
would
be
truly
a
representative
democratic
type
of
government.
these
fundamental
rights
are
involved
here
both
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
say
there
is
invidious
discrimination,
we
say
there
is
first
amendment
rights
violated,
the
right
of
political
association
from
the
voter's
standpoint
and
from
the
candidate's
standpoint
and
we
also
say
that
the
classification
is
in
that
nature
or
neighborhood
or
criterion
which
is
suspect
money.
it
does
not
even
say,
wealth
or
property,
it
says
money,
cash,
and
when
that
is
involved,
when
that
is
involved
then
they
must,
this
court
must
under
its
test
give
it
a
careful,
scrutinizing
examination
and
the
state
must
show
a
necessary
compelling
interest
for
having
such
classification.
i
do
not
think
they
--
and
i
think
they
say
in
their
brief;
if
that
is
true,
the
ball
game
is
over.
i
say
the
ball
game
is
over
and
it
is
time
to
change.
and
just
briefly
interjecting
house
bill
5
in
here
which
was
not
an
issue.
i
am
going
to
ask
this
court
if
it
will
to,
when
it
makes
if
and
when
makes
its
decision,
to
make
it
so
broad
if
it
is
in
favor
of
the
appellees
that
we
would
not
have
to
be
coming
up
to
this
court
time
and
time
and
again
for
relief,
like
was
done
when
they
were
trying
to
keep
the
black
people
from
running
in
the
democratic
parties
where
five
separate
suits,
one
right
after
the
other
had
to
be
brought
because
texas
does
not
give
up
that
easy.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
suspect
classification
that
compelling
interest
test
applies,
i
further
submit
that
the
excuses
and
reasons
that
they
give
for
this
legislation
are
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
achievement
of
the
state's
objective.
that
is
of
keeping
the
--
they
say
chaos
will
result.
they
say
the
ballot
would
be
cluttered
with
a
lot
of
non-serious
and
spurious
candidates.
that
is
speculative,
that
is
remote,
the
other
states
have
worked
that
out
and
the
state
can
do
it
the
same
way.
how?
by
a
modicum
of
support
petitions
and
not
to
couple
it
with
alternatives,
if
one
can
pay,
one
candidate
can
pay
a
fee
and
the
other
one
can
get
a
petition
to
show
modicum
of
support.
that
is
again
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
if
we
are
to
envision
the
true
concept
of
government,
of
the
people
by
and
for
the
people
that
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
be
broadened,
affirmed
but
broadened
on
the
first
amendment
rights
and
the
equal
protection
rights.
that
is
as
to
candidates,
they
have
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
run
for
office.
as
long
as
they
possess
all
other
qualifications
and
there
is
shown
a
modicum
of
support
for
them.
i
believe
that
is
all
i
have
to
say.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
john
morehead,
and
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
democratic
party
of
the
state
of
texas.
this
case
involves
a
constitutionality
of
political
party
filing
fees
as
an
absolute
prerequisite
to
getting
on
the
primary
ballot.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
duly
constituted
three-judged
court.
the
court
below
held
that
filing
fees
violate
the
first
amendment,
the
due
process
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
when
used
either
as
a
revenue
collecting
device
or
when
made
an
absolute
requirement
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot.
there
were
intervenors
in
this
case
who
desired
to
vote
for
the
candidates
who
did
not
have
the
filing
fee.
judge
taylor
writing
for
the
three-judge
court
decided
that
since
the
intervenors
wanted
to
vote
for
these
particular
candidates
that
this
was
really
a
voter’s
rights
case,
and
that
therefore,
in
order
for
the
state
to
sustain
its
laws,
we
had
to
meet
the
burden
of
showing
a
compelling
state
interest.
our
position
is
that
the
primary
question
before
this
court,
is
whether
or
not
the
traditional
rational
relation
test
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
to
this
factual
situation
or
whether
or
not
the
state
must
show
a
compelling
state
interest
in
order
to
sustain
its
laws.
to
begin
with,
let
me
say
that
i
consider
the
issues
involved
in
a
nominating
primary
or
political
party,
to
be
different
from
those
issues
which
are
involved
in
a
general
election.
the
reasoning
of
mr.
justice
stewart
in
turner
against
fouche,
i
think
that
is
the
correct
pronunciation,
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
a
filing
fee
is
an
absolute
prerequisite
to
stand
for
office
in
a
general
election
would
amount
to
invidious
discrimination.
the
first
question
to
be
decided
here
today
is
whether
or
not
the
primary
should
be
treated
exactly
like
a
general
election.
there
is
language
in
the
1944
case,
smith
against
allwright
with
which
mr.
justice
marshall
is
very
familiar,
which
indicates
that
the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
and
smith,
mr.
justice
reed
said,
when
primaries
became
a
part
of
the
machinery
for
choosing
officials,
state
and
national
as
they
have
here,
the
same
test
to
determine
the
character
of
discrimination
as
a
abridgment
should
be
applied
to
the
primary
as
are
applied
to
the
general
election.
the
court
in
smith
was
talking
about
a
state
statute
which
fenced
off
the
rights
of
otherwise
qualified
black
voters
to
participate
in
the
democratic
primary.
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
smith,
many
cases
have
came
before
this
court
which
involved
both
voter
rights
and
candidate
rights.
the
issues
and
problems
have
been
definitionally
refined
to
the
extent
that
i
think
that
if
smith
were
to
come
before
this
court
today,
i
believe
that
this
court
would
probably,
would
obviously
reach
the
same
result,
but
would
probably
use
a
little
bit
different
wording
than
it
was
used
in
smith.
i
feel
like
that
it
would
be
much
more
similar
to,
for
example
the
case
of
kramer
versus
the
union
free
school
district.
in
order
to
get
an
accurate
perspective
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
a
brief
sketch
of
how
texas
election
systems
work
will
be
helpful
to
the
court.
primaries
are
held
in
may,
and
under
the
laws
as
it
exists
today,
the
payment
of
the
fee
is
an
absolute
requirement
to
get
on
the
ballot,
no
write-ins
at
all
are
permitted
on
the
primary
ballot.
in
november,
the
election
is
free,
no
fees
are
charged
at
all
in
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
everyone.
you
can
only
vote,
and
either
there
is
a
law
which
says
you
can
only
vote
in
a
democratic
primary
or
in
republican
primary,
but
all
qualified
voters
are
eligible
to
vote
in
a
primary
election.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
no
sir,
they
do
not.
at
the
top
of
the
ballot
is
printed
the
words
which
say
that
i
pledge
to
support
the
nominees,
but
of
course
no
way
that
could
ever
be
imposed.
and
also
in
our
november
election,
we
have
a
much,
much
easier
method
for
independent
candidates
or
independent
parties
to
get
on
the
ballot
then
the
court
was
faced
with
in
the
recent
case
of
jenness
against
fortson,
there,
this
court
held
that
5%
was
alright.
in
texas,
it
is
1%
of
the
people
for
state
wide
election,
and
for
local
elections,
it
is
also
1%
except
there
is
an
absolute
maximum,
it
cannot
ever
have
to
have
more
than
500
signatures
in
order
to
get
on
the
november
ballot.
and
so,
as
the
court
is
aware,
this
is
a
consolidated
case
involving
three
different
candidates
who
desire
to
get
on
the
election.
the
two
local
candidates,
the
one
for
county
judge
in
fort
worth
and
the
one
for
county
commissioner
out
in
el
paso,
both
of
which
counties
have
populations
in
excess
of
300,000
people
only
needed
500
people
on
a
petition
in
order
to
get
on
the
november
ballot.
we
think
that
a
primary
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
no.
you
just
get
1%
of
the
people
that
want
to
support
an
independent
candidate.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
1%
of
eligible
voters,
not
1%
of
the
people
that
voted
in
the
last
election,
but
1%
of
the
eligible
voters.
now,
the
state
thinks
that
a
political
primary
is
an
extension
of
the
right
to
vote,
similar
to
which
this
court
was
faced
in
the
mcdonald
case
involving
the
absentee
ballot
for
the
inmates
of
the
cook
county
prison.
in
a
primary,
you
get
to
vote
a
second
time,
not
only
do
you
get
to
vote
in
november,
but
you
also
get
an
opportunity
to
vote
in
may.
and
we
therefore
submit
that
this
is
an
extension
as
also
you
can
see
that
a
candidate
gets
the
right
to
run
twice.
for
example,
mary
lindsay
lost
in
the
republican
primary
for
the
mayor
of
new
york
and
was
able
to
come
back
as
an
independent
in
november
and
still
win
the
election.
we
submit
that
the
footnote
in
kramer
by
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
which
points
out
the
distinction
between
fencing
off
case
as
happened
in
kramer,
where
the
man
was
not
eligible
to
vote
at
all,
and
the
type
of
case
that
you
have
in
mcdonald,
which
is
an
extension
of
the
voting
rights
is
a
distinction
which
this
court
should
apply
in
this
case,
and
that
the
three-judge
court
when
they
applied
the
rational
relation
test,
i
mean,
when
they
applied
the
compelling
state
interest
test
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
texas,
just
simply
used
the
wrong
test
and
that
therefore,
if
it
were
not
for
the
press
of
the
fact
that
we
have
new
primaries
coming
up
in
1972
and
new
deadlines
to
meet
that
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case
is
really
a
remand
to
the
three-judge
court
to
apply
the
proper
test
to
the
texas
laws.
we
submit
of
course
that
the
rational
relation
test
is
the
one
which
this
court
should
use.
now,
even
applying
a
rational
relation
test,
we
are
still
faced
with
the
problem
of
does
this
filing
fee
as
an
absolute
requirement
to
get
on
a
primary
ballot,
which
is
a
part
of
the
election
process
constitute
invidious
discrimination.
if
the
rational
relation
test
applies,
then
we
submit
that
the
court
could
look,
should
look
to
the
other
side
of
the
question,
and
what
purposes
does
the
fee
serve.
the
fee
serves
two
purposes
to
the
state
of
texas.
first,
it
serves
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
ballot
and
secondly,
it
serves
the
purpose
of
financing
the
actual
cost
of
the
election
itself.
in
other
words,
the
candidates
pay
all
the
cost
of
printing
of
the
ballots,
paying
the
voting
officials,
all
of
the
other
incidental
things,
renting
a
place
for
use
of
the
public
schools,
most
of
the
time
to
hold
the
elections
in,
getting
the
pencils,
renting
the
voting
machines
from
the
county
and
all
of
these
matters.
this
is
taxed
to
the
candidates,
and
not
to
the
states.
on
the
face
of
this,
both
of
these
reasons
would
appear
legitimate,
but
we
still
must
look
to
the
question
of
whether
they
have
the
effect
of
classifying
an
effectually
excluding
from
the
electoral
process,
people
who
are
unable
to
pay
for
the
fee.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
am
sorry,
i
do
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
to
me,
inherent
in
our
constitution,
both
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
state
constitution,
we
have
an
elective
process,
that
is
the
way
we
select.
our
public
officials
is
through
election.
the
ultimate
election
since
that
is
the
way
we
are
going
to
run
our
government;
it
seems
to
me
must
be
borne,
the
cost
of
that
must
be
borne
by
the
state.
and
that
someone
who
is
unable
to
pay
the
fee
there
mr.
justice,
obviously
must
have
the
opportunity
to
stand
for
ultimate
election,
and
it
might
be
a
legitimate
purpose
to
have
finance
it
that
way,
but
you
certainly
could
not
exclude
someone
from
a
general
election
in
november
because
of
his
inability
to
pay
this
fee.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
well,
it
seems
to
me
that,
first
we
need
to
look
historically
at
the
problem
of
the
primaries.
primaries
worked
there
when
we
first
started
holding
elections
in
this
country
and
as
i
understand
it,
some
states
still
nominate
through,
through
convention
as
opposed
to
through
primary,
and
the
fact
that
someone
is
unable
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
the
primary
election,
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
cannot
get
elected,
whereas
if
he
is
unable
to
get
on
the
ballot
in
november,
the
door
is
closed,
he
is
foreclosed
of
any
possibility
for
election.
does
that
respond
sir?
that
is
the
response
i
have.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
have
been
thinking
on
the
problem
instead
of
the
attack.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
in
terms
of
total
cost,
it
is
not
sir.
the
reason
being
that
in
texas
we
hold
two
primary
elections,
and
only
one
general
election
and
therefore
you
got
to
have
two
sets
of
officials,
and
if
you
are
going
to
hold
them
in
different
places,
and
two
sets
of
ballot
boxes
for
example
or
two
sets
of
voting
machines,
where
as
in
the
general
election,
you
do
not
have
to
hold
one
of
these.
one
of
the
problems
which
i
think
needs
to
be
considered
if
the
rational
relation
test
does
apply,
what
are
the
alternatives?
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
not
the
ultimate
right
to
run,
no
sir,
i
do
not
think.
i
mean,
i
do
think
the
first
amendment
does
protect
the
ultimate
right
to
run
for
a
state
office.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
not
that
i
have
seen,
but
it
does
an
abstract
proposition.
i
would
think
that
that
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
would
get
the
first
amendment
back
in
and
apply
into
the
states
on
that,
i
am
saying
that
correctly.
what
the
three-judge
court
based
their
reasoning
on
sir,
was
this,
they
said
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
right,
they
said
that
this
was
a
voter
right
question,
since
voters
wanted
to
vote
for
a
particular
candidate
that
therefore
this
was
a
voter
question
and
not
a
candidate
question,
and
that
therefore
the
right
to
speak
as
vote.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
would
have
thought
that
it
probably
was.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
just
have
to
be
frank
and
say
that
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
on
the
first
question,
i
would
think
so,
but
i
must
plead
ignorance
to
that.
if
we
want
to
find
this
another
way
to
regulate
the
size
of
our
primary
ballot
other
than
fees,
we
are
reduced
ultimately
i
think
to
a
petition
which
to
me,
in
other
words
you
have
to
show
some
sort
of
modicrum
of
support
in
order
to
get
on
the
primary
ballot
because
otherwise,
you
face
the
very
real
problem
of
500
people
filing
for
the
office
of
governor
of
the
state
of
texas,
that
it
is
not
quite
the
same
problem
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
williams
against
rhodes,
there
he
talked
about
the
theoretical
possibility
of
the
proliferation,
if
i
can
get
all
those
words,
either
political
parties
and
i
think
that
the
theoretical
possibility
of
proliferation
of
candidates
is
a
much
more
real
problem
than
the
possibility
of
having
a
whole
lot
of
political
parties.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir,
they
do.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
some
do
it
by
petition,
others
have
just
not
ever
met
the
problem.
the
most
serious
situation
i
think
arose
in
the
state
of
michigan
one
time
where
they
did
end
up
with
700
people
on
a
primary
ballot.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir,
it
certainly
can.
it
is
expensive
to
hold
an
election.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
well,
for
the
district
judge's
office
which
is
a
county
office
in
the
larger
metropolitan
areas.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes,
it
is
the
county
committee.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes,
the
particular
party
committee.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
each
year
they
set
them
on
their
own
original
basis
and
this
particular
case,
this
$9,000
fee
to
file
for
district
judge,
what
they
do
is
try
to
collect
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
election
and
after
it
is
over,
they
rebate
the
excess
proportionately
depending
on
what
fee
you
pay.
in
this
particular
case,
they
rebated
57%.
in
other
words,
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
bottom
up,
they
invested
more
than
100%
on
the
amount
that
and
there
i
think
that
if
a
candidate
come
in
to
the
state
court
and
said
that
this
particular
county
chairman
or
this
particular
county
committee
abused
their
discretion
and
the
amount
of
this
fee
they
set,
i
think
you
have
got
some
redress
in
the
court
of
the
state
of
texas
in
that
matter.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
that
is
right,
ultimately
they
just
paid
for
the
actual
cost,
and
ultimately
all
of
them
divided
on
the
amount
of
payment.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
that
is
correct
sir.
they
always
try
to
get
more
because
for
a
losing
candidate
they
have
particular
amount
of
trouble
collecting
money
from
him.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
a
better
way
to
ask
that
would
be
how
many
were
unopposed,
and
in
tarrant
county
i
think
there
are
eight.
the
people
from
tarrant
county
can
answer
that
question.
i
think
all,
but
one
of
them
was
actually
unopposed
in
the
democratic
primary.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
two.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes.
the
unopposed
candidates.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
the
district
judge’s
salary
would
be
about,
there
is
two
different
ways
you
pay
for
it,
one,
the
state
pays
a
basic
amount
which
is
now
21,000
and
many
counties
vote
an
additional
emolument,
most
of
them
rounding
up
to
about
25,000.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
the
term
is
four
years.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
think
there
is
one
example
of
that
where
there
is
a
county,
where
there
was
a
$50
fee
and
he
do
not
get
paid
any
dime.
but
that
is
the
basic
fee
that
each
person
has
to
pay
$50
filling
fee
and
then
later
on
after
you
find
out
how
many
contested
races
you
have
and
how
many
candidates
you
have,
then
after
the
filing
deadline
is
when
there
is
additional
assessment
is
leveled.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir,
but
these
fees
are
different.
the
legislator
or
is
the
one
that
passes
these
laws,
and
so
therefore,
the
cost
to
run
for
a
statewide
office
somehow
seems
to
be
less
than
it
does
to
run
for
the
others
and
the
counsel
for
mr.
pate
(ph)
have
said
that
this
is
a
discrimination
in
itself.
they
charge
$150
to
run
for
the
state
legislator,
$1,000
to
run
for
governor,
that
is
the
maximum
for
statewide
office
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
not
to
the
state.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes.
to
the
secretary
of
state,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
right.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
right.
the
other
alternative
that
i
would
like
to
pose
before
i
sit
down
is,
if
the
candidates
do
not
finance
these
party
primaries,
who
must
finance
it?
the
other
alternative
is
that
of
course,
you
need
to
make
the
counties
and
state
itself
finance
these
particular
elections.
and
to
say
that
the
states
must
themselves
finance
it,
and
that
that
is
part
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
quite
a
different
thing
as
saying
that
the
legislator
can
finance
it
itself,
if
it
so
desires.
in
other
words,
to
say
that
the
state
must
finance
it,
is
to
say
that
somewhere
in
the
equal
protection
clause,
there
is
some
sort
of
affirmative
language
which
says
that
the
state
must
act,
that
the
state
must
hold
this
primary
election
and
finance
it
themselves.
because
i
think
that
ultimately
that
whether
it
is
$50
filing
fee
or
$0.05
filing
fee
or
$9,000
filing
fee,
that
the
filing
fee
itself,
because
you
are
always
going
to
run
into
that
one
person
or
that
group
of
people
that
the
$50
is
just
as
important
to
as
or
the
$5
would
be
just
as
important
or
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
harper
that,
that
the
$1.75
on
virginia,
poll
tax
does
not
really
have
any
valid
relation
to
the
man’s
ability
and
right
and
qualifications
to
stand
for
all
this
or
to
vote
for
that
particular
matter.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
no
sir.
in
their
opinion,
the
court
said
that
it
is
unconstitutional
on
two
respects.
number
one,
it
cannot
be
used,
they
used
the
word
revenue
raising
device.
it
is
not
a
revenue-raising
device
in
the
sense
that
it
goes
into
the
state
conference
like
the
school,
the
poll
tax
is
used
just
to
pay
the
cost.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
if
they
said
you
could
not
use
filing
fees
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
election
and
number
two,
they
said
it
could
not
be
made
an
absolute
requirement
to
get
on
the
ballot.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
read
it
that
way,
yes.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
when
you
see
the
requirement
that
our
state
legislator
put
on
the
affidavit
of
indigency
in
their
last
legislation,
that
is
obviously
got
to
be
bad,
i
mean
that
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
always
had
reference
sir
to
looking
at,
i
am
looking
at
the
jurisdictional
statement,
which
is
where
the
opinion
is
printed
at
the
page
10a
in
the
back.
the
top
sentence,
the
court.
now
he
says,
in
the
second
sentence,
we
have
limited
our
decision
here
to
say
that
a
filing
fee
violates
the
first
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause,
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
it
is
used
as
a
revenue
collecting
device,
that
is
what
i
thought
the
court
really
held.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
yes
sir,
and
squarely
on
the
voting
rights
problem
as
opposed
to
the
candidate
right
problem.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
that
is
correct,
i
see,
if
we
have
a
first
amendment
problem
and
a
compelling
state
interest
problem,
then
these
statutes
ultimately
must
fall,
i
think
that
is
the
really
proper
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
no
sir,
i
do
not.
i
will
research
this
problem
and
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
$0.10
fee,that
is
the
way
i
read
it.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
that
is
right.
that
is
what
i
really
ultimately
--
i
did
not
think
that,
that
is
what
they
are
really
resting
it
on
since
they
had
set
it
back
at
first
and
it
is
just
a
guess
there
to
answer
that
question.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
believe
that
broadly
stated
the
issue
here
is
whether
there
should
be
the
opportunity
for
equal
participation
in
the
electoral
process
by
candidates,
with
or
without
money?
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
will
restate
it,
i
believe
broadly
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
there
should
be
the
opportunity
for
equal
participation
in
the
electoral
process
by
candidates.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
no.
should
i
continue
or
wait?
mr.
john
f.
morehead
alright.
broadly
stated
your
honors,
i
believe
the
issue
here
is
whether
there
should
be
the
opportunity
for
equal
participation
in
the
electoral
process
by
candidates
with
or
without
money
or
who
refuse
to
pay.
i
do
not
believe
that,
and
i
do
not
fully
concur
with
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court.
i
think
that
opinion
is
too
reserved
and
too
conservative
in
our
political
way
of
life,
in
our
democratic
political
way
of
life.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
the
reason
--
mr.
john
f.
morehead
well,
the
reasoning,
mr.
chief
justices,
what
i
disagree
with
and
that
it
limited
only
on
first
amendment
rights,
what
i
am
saying.
my
position
is
that
the
right
to
run
to
office
is
as
much
a
fundamental
right
as
the
right
to
vote,
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
which
guarantees
political
association
and
that
that
right
should
not
be
impinged
upon.
that
is
my
position
and
i
think
that
if
that
is
followed,
it
would
eliminate
exactly
what
is
happening
in
texas
under
this
system,
and
that
is
a
monopoly
in
government
itself
is
what
exists
down
there.
there
is
a
monopoly
because
it
is
a
government
by
the
selected,
for
the
selected
and
now
the
selected.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
crux
of
the
issue
is
whether
the
classification
here
which
limits
the
right
to
vote
or
seek
public
office
as
a
candidate
is
per
se
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
which
is
the
rights
of
freedom
of
political
association
and
equal
protection.
the
candidate,
i
am
speaking
for
the
voter’s
rights
as
well
as
of
candidate’s
rights.
this
was,
like
in
rhodes,
there,
there
was
discrimination
between
parties
and
in
that
case,
as
justice
white
inquired,
is
there
a
case
from
this
court
that
talks
about
first
amendment
rights
in
connection
with
the
right
to
run
to
office,
and
it
did.
that
is
the
case
where
they
talked
about
first
amendment
rights
as
a
right
to
run
to
office.
i
agree
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
permits
the
states
to
make
classifications
and
it
does
not
require
them
to
treat
them
uniformly.
nevertheless,
it
bans
any
invidious
discrimination
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
involved
in
this
case,
invidious
discrimination,
unfair
discrimination.
the
primary
election
is
an
organ
of
the
state
and
as
stated
in
that
case
by
in
allwright
case,
when
primaries
become
a
part
of
the
machinery
for
choosing
official
state
and
national
as
they
have
here,
the
same
task
to
determine
the
character
of
discrimination
to
be
applied
to
the
primaries
as
they
are
applied
to
the
general
election.
the
general
election,
your
honors
and
mr.
chief
justice
merely
confirm
the
discrimination
that
exists
in
the
primaries.
and
the
alternate
about
petitions
for
independent
is
not
a
reality
in
the
political
life.
in
fact,
in
checking
that
section
of
the
law,
those
people
that
voted
in
the
primary
cannot
sign
those
petitions
for
candidates,
non-partisan
candidates
that
run
in
the
general
election.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
make
the
opposite
statement.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
differently,
but
we
have
checked
and
i
was
prepared
for
this
and
if
you
will
check
it,
i
believe
i
am
correct.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
i
do
not
have
it
with
me,
i
have
is
1305,
i
believe
13.50,
so
this
is
not
like
georgia
and
portison
(ph),
justice
stewart
where
the
election
process
was
wide
open.
this
is
freezing
in
the
status
quo,
the
ins
are
ins
and
the
outs
are
out.
and
that
is
why
there
is
no
opposition,
and
this
country
is
based
on
the
political
fluidity
i
believe
they
say
in
the
electoral
process
as
what
this
court
is
very
concerned
with,
that
it
is
maintained
and
that
is
just
what
this
filing
fee
system
prevents.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
correct,
and
those
concepts
of
course
eroded.
just
like
snowden
versus
hughes,
there
is
no
longer
the
law
in
this
court,
in
the
incorporation
theory
from
the
first
amendment
into
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
that
is
why
i
say
snowden
is
not
the
controller
in
this
case,
what
so
ever.
it
is
totally
inapplicable
to
the
fact
situation
and
onto
the
brought
principles
of
law
that
i
have
believed
should
apply
to
deciding
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
morehead
it
would
be
truly
a
representative
democratic
type
of
government.
these
fundamental
rights
are
involved
here
both
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
say
there
is
invidious
discrimination,
we
say
there
is
first
amendment
rights
violated,
the
right
of
political
association
from
the
voter's
standpoint
and
from
the
candidate's
standpoint
and
we
also
say
that
the
classification
is
in
that
nature
or
neighborhood
or
criterion
which
is
suspect
money.
it
does
not
even
say,
wealth
or
property,
it
says
money,
cash,
and
when
that
is
involved,
when
that
is
involved
then
they
must,
this
court
must
under
its
test
give
it
a
careful,
scrutinizing
examination
and
the
state
must
show
a
necessary
compelling
interest
for
having
such
classification.
i
do
not
think
they
--
and
i
think
they
say
in
their
brief;
if
that
is
true,
the
ball
game
is
over.
i
say
the
ball
game
is
over
and
it
is
time
to
change.
and
just
briefly
interjecting
house
bill
5
in
here
which
was
not
an
issue.
i
am
going
to
ask
this
court
if
it
will
to,
when
it
makes
if
and
when
makes
its
decision,
to
make
it
so
broad
if
it
is
in
favor
of
the
appellees
that
we
would
not
have
to
be
coming
up
to
this
court
time
and
time
and
again
for
relief,
like
was
done
when
they
were
trying
to
keep
the
black
people
from
running
in
the
democratic
parties
where
five
separate
suits,
one
right
after
the
other
had
to
be
brought
because
texas
does
not
give
up
that
easy.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
suspect
classification
that
compelling
interest
test
applies,
i
further
submit
that
the
excuses
and
reasons
that
they
give
for
this
legislation
are
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
achievement
of
the
state's
objective.
that
is
of
keeping
the
--
they
say
chaos
will
result.
they
say
the
ballot
would
be
cluttered
with
a
lot
of
non-serious
and
spurious
candidates.
that
is
speculative,
that
is
remote,
the
other
states
have
worked
that
out
and
the
state
can
do
it
the
same
way.
how?
by
a
modicum
of
support
petitions
and
not
to
couple
it
with
alternatives,
if
one
can
pay,
one
candidate
can
pay
a
fee
and
the
other
one
can
get
a
petition
to
show
modicum
of
support.
that
is
again
violating
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
if
we
are
to
envision
the
true
concept
of
government,
of
the
people
by
and
for
the
people
that
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court
be
broadened,
affirmed
but
broadened
on
the
first
amendment
rights
and
the
equal
protection
rights.
that
is
as
to
candidates,
they
have
a
right
under
the
first
amendment
to
run
for
office.
as
long
as
they
possess
all
other
qualifications
and
there
is
shown
a
modicum
of
support
for
them.
i
believe
that
is
all
i
have
to
say.
