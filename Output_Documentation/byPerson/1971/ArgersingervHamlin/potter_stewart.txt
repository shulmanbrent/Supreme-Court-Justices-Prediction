before

in

in

was
that
the

may
not
be

in

was

and
how
are

defined

justice

no

justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
starting
on
the
--
situation
is
still
is
not
clear
i
gather
in
florida,
if
the
justice
boyd's
separate
opinion
in
this
case,
he
accurately
describes
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
which
hold
that
the
--
which
he
says
extend
the
right
to
counsel
the
person
facing
possible
imprisonment
regardless
of
the
degree
of
their
offenses
or
length
of
possible
incarceration.
are
there
decisions
from
the
fifth
circuit
to
that
effect?
justice
potter
stewart
their
right
to
counsel,
whenever
imprisonment
is
a
possible
sentence
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
punishment,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
even
for
a
parking
ticket?
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
been
directed
to
inform
the
indigent
defendants
of
their
right
to
counsel,
in
what
kind
of
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
informs
of
the
right,
in
what
kind
of
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
even
in
parking
ticket
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
i
assumed
it
was.
that
is
the
reason
i
asked
you
what
kind
of
case
is
this
judge
informs
indigent
defendants
that
they
have
the
right
to
counsel?
is
it
only
in
cases
where
imprisonment
is
a
possible
punishment?
justice
potter
stewart
or
stop
light
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
not
the
parking
ticket.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course,
that
is
the
sixth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
talking
about
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
it
certainly
does.
justice
potter
stewart
i
will
agree
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
might
not
appear
so,
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
trial
before
the
trier
of
the
fact
that
had
heard
all
the
evidence
and
it
might
turn
out
to
be
a
much
more
aggravated
and
serious
situation
than
it
had
appeared
before
the
trial
began.
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
then,
that
if
a
conviction
was
followed
by
a
sentence
to
prison
and
no
lawyer
had
been
provided,
then
that
conviction
would
have
to
be
set
aside
in
the
new
trial
order,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
or
if
he
is
sent
to
prison
then
maybe
it
turns
out
that
there
was
a
very
good
reason,
why
he
be
sent
to
prison
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
gravity
or
seriousness
or
outrageousness
of
the
conduct,
but
then
a
new
trial
should
be
ordered
and
at
this
time
he
gets
a
lawyer,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
a
new
trial
would
not
be
ordered,
unless
he
appealed,
i
would
assume
that
he
would
have
appealed?
justice
potter
stewart
he
go
to
prison,
but
in
my
brother
marshall’s
hypothetical
case,
where
you
have
an
offense
where
never
in
the
particular
jurisdiction
had
anybody
been
sentenced
to
prison
for
the
commission
of
this
offense
and
so,
at
the
outset
of
the
trial,
it
could
be
fairly
confidently
assumed
that
this
defendant
was
not
going
to
prison
and
then,
it
developed
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
that
for
one
reason
or
another,
this
was
a
singularly,
egregiously,
outrageous
of
example
of
this
particular
violation
and
for
the
sufficient
reasons
after
the
defendant
was
convicted,
he
was
sentenced
to
prison
and
for
the
first
time
in
history
of
that
jurisdiction.
then
it
would
be
your
position
that
the
convicted
defendant
could
then
appeal
and
have
a
new
trial
this
time
with
a
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
a
violation
in
metro?
justice
potter
stewart
so
a
municipal
offense
or
a
metro
violation
is
something
less
even
than
a
misdemeanor?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
in
terms
of
punishment,
what
is
the
maximum
that
they
carry?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
rules
approved
by
this
court,
the
magistrates,
has
anything
to
do
with
it,
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
shea,
on
january
27
of
this
year,
this
court,
as
you
know
promulgated
the
rules
or
procedure
for
the
trial
of
minor
offenses
before
magistrates,
which
by
subsequent
enactment
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
i
understand
it
have
now
become
effective
rules.
if
many
were
those
rules
--
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
--
there
is
reference
too
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
what
bearing
if
any,
do
you
think
they
have
on
your
argument,
on
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
now
which
--
now,
you
have
given
me
two
quite
different
answers?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
are
there
unconstitutional
or
do
not
they
bare
on
your
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
your
second
answer
was
that
these
rules
do
not
say
that
person
shall
not
have
the
right
to
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
you
do
not
read
it,
which
way?
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
case,
if
your
reading
is
correct
then
they
are
not
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
earlier
in
the
argument
mr.
rogow
you
said
that
you
were
supported
by
the
government
and
i
know
that
is
true
basically.
however,
the
constitutional
rule
that
they
submit
is
not
identical
to
the
one
using
that,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
a
little
more
finally
spun
out
perhaps?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would
be
happy
and
content
with
the
government
submission,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
cases
like
drunken
driving
and
(inaudible)
justice

just

justice

justice
potter

how
many
states
which
is
mr.
general
if
you
know
or
about
how
many
now
permit
represent
--
appearance
in
court
on
behalf
of
the
indigents
by
law
students
or
people
who
are
not
yet
admitted
to
law?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
several
states
there
now,
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
before
you
are
asked
to
do
something
like
that
among
various
alternative
requests
in
the
case
of
brown
against
board
of
education,
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
effectuation
chaos
(voice

isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wasn't
clear,
but
i
read
the
opinion
and
it
indicated
to
me
the
court
was
asked
alternatively
to
do
a
variety
of
things,
one
of
which
was
to
give
a
time,
but
give
a
time
in
the
future
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
albeit
speed,
but
it
was
asked
to
do
something
else
among
other
things
and
that
was
to
give
a
certain
time
when
it
should
be
effective,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
you
said
to
court
from
the
application
of
the
rule
of
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
is
that
it
also
says
property.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
differentiate
between
the
two.
justice
potter
stewart
well
so
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned
they
are
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
unless
the
punishment
is
gong
to
be
more
than
six
months
imprisonment.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that
is
something
else
again?
justice
potter
stewart
this
parade
of
horrible
of
yours
maybe
i
do
not
know
what
your

is
in

about
jury
trials

so

as
the
federal
constitution
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
we
have
already
done
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
we
have
already
held
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
a
jury
trial
unless
the
imprisonment
is
going
to
be
longer
than
six
months.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
equal
protection
would
require
of
the
judge
inform
a
non

defendant
the
same
way,
would
he
not?
