mr.
robert
w.
geddes
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
limited
time,
i
would
like
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
to
the
court
that
the
appellee
wayne
stanton,
his
position
is
that
we
should
not
be
in
the
federal
court.
not
whether
that
we
should
be
in
this
court
so
much
or
whether
or
not
we
should
be
in
the
federal
court
if
the
doctrine
of
abstention
or
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
administrative
remedies
had
any
meaning
under
this
type
of
case.
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
it
is
fully
covered
in
our
briefs,
it
is
fully
covered
with
case
law.
there
were
charges
in
there
that
the
applicants
or
the
claimants
says
we
could
not
file
an
application
unless
we
sued
for
divorce,
unless
we
filed
for
legal
separation.
the
evidence
is
clear
in
fact
two
of
the
claimants
alone
received
benefits
less
than
three
month
after
their
husbands
separated
and
they
never
filed
for
divorce.
there
was
a
witness
smith,
she
testified
that
she
filed
her
application
immediately
and
within
a
month
she
received
aid,
she
never
filed
for
divorce.
there
was
a
witness
blake
laclair
(ph)
she
receive
aid
in
two
months
after
separation,
never
filed
for
divorce.
so
as
far
as
this
six
month
requirement
under
the
indiana
regulation,
all
the
six
month
is
a
guideline.
in
other
words,
after
six
months
is
a
conclusive
presumption.
but
if
the
need
is
there
and
the
absence
is
action
bonafide,
the
regulation
says
that
the
person
can
receive
aid
immediately.
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
damico
and
all
of
the
others
where
was
a
three
month
situation
sue
start.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
the
district
court
held
your
honor
mr.
justice
that
there
was
no
substantial
federal
question
and
the
claimants
did
not
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies
and
therefore
they
said
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
your
honor
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
the
pleadings
alleged
the
regulation
which
says
six
months
and
this
is
statutory.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
your
honor.
what
the
court
did
at
least
in
my
opinion,
they
had
the
pleadings
in
front
and
they
had
the
motions
to
dismiss
and
they
heard
60
witnesses
to
determine
whether
the
court
should
take
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case,
fully
hear
the
case
on
the
merits.
there
was
about
ten
hours
of
testimony
involved
and
after
concluding
that
and
after
hearing
the
evidence
then
they
made
their
conclusion
notes
of
substantial
federal
question
on
the
pleadings
and
the
party
failed
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
your
honor
they
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
mr.
justice
they
did
not.
this
case
is
the
only
case
i
could
find
and
the
only
case
i
know
of
where
this
court
is
faced
now
with
the
decision
to
make
with
respect
to
administrative
remedies.
now
the
appellant
have
cited
king,
they
have
cited
damico,
they
have
cited
damico
and
mcneese.
but
each
of
those
cases,
if
you
look
at
the
merits
of
those
cases,
the
administrative
remedies
involved
there
was
either
not
adequate.
it
was
not
speedy
or
it
would
have
been
feudal.
for
example,
in
mcneese
i
believe
the
parties
would
have
to
go
back
and
get
--
it
was
a
segregation
case,
they
would
have
to
get
%10
of
the
boarder
so
many
people
and
then
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
your
honor
they
just
said
that
there
was
under
1983,
you
did
not
have
the
exhaustment
state
remedy.
what
has
been
causing
confusion
with
the
federal
courts
is
whether
this
--
the
confusion
is
that
if
you
make
a
claim
under
1983,
does
that
give
you
absolute
right
to
bypass
all
administrative
remedies
and
that
is
really
the
question
before
this
court
today.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
mcneese
did
say
this
so.
they
did
say
and
they
are
not
pretty
good
exact
words,
but
they
said,
more
or
less
that
if
the
administrative
remedy
there
is
feudal
or
if
it
would
not
do
any
good,
you
do
not
have
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
my
opinion
your
honor,
in
our
opinion.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
alright
your
honor,
in
answer
to
that
question
the
administrative
procedure
setup
in
indiana
has
a
number
of
means
under
which
you
can
appeal,
administratively
appeal.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
well,
it
says
--
one
of
the
mains
it
says
if
the
applicant
believes
his
civil
or
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated,
he
can
appeal
administratively
and
under
indiana
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
alright,
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
indiana
provides
that
he
may
have
anybody
represent
him.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
who
decides
it?
this
is
a
welfare
administrator,
the
first
step.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
he
is
not.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
he
can
make
a
finding
with
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
he
can
make
finding
whether
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
he
can.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
pardon?
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
i
do
not
know
what
oath
he
takes
mr.
justice,
but
under
the
regulation
if
the
person
believes
his
constitutional
civil
rights
have
been
violated,
he
can
appeal
administratively.
now
if
the
indiana
regulation
was
a
flat
six
month
rule
where
there
was
no
leeway
for
aid
immediately,
then
i
would
say
that
whatever
decision
you
make
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
the
administrative
agency
cannot
make
that
decision.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes
he
is,
but
when
he
filed
his
complaint
with
the
federal
court
on
that,
the
federal
court,
as
interpret
the
entry,
says
there
is
not
a
substantial
constitutional
question
raised
by
this
regulation
and
therefore
the
parties
must
exhaust
their
available
or
administrative
remedies.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
it
is
our
position
that
what
they
have
alleged,
the
applicants
alleged
here.
there
is
a
entire
administrative
process
established
in
indiana
to
handle.
for
example,
one
of
the
application
is
denied
you
can
administratively
appeal
it.
if
it
is
not
acted
upon
a
reasonable
time,
you
can
administratively
appeal
it.
if
your
aid
is
revoked
or
modified
you
can
administratively
appeal
it.
if
you
go
to
a
case
worker
and
he
refuses
to
accept
your
application
you
can
administratively
appeal.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
first
step
mr.
justice
is
a
state
department
of
public
welfare
and
if
the
party
is
still
dissatisfied
then
it
is
reviewed
by
the
state
board
of
public
welfare
upon
his
request.
and
then
the
applicant
can
go
into
either
the
state
of
the
federal
court
depending
on
his
own
choice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
of
his
own,
either
of
his
own
choice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
it
is
our
opinion
your
honor
with
the
available
discovery,
the
entire
record
could
be
brought
into
the
federal
court
order
state.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
it
would
be
de
novo,
a
new
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
it
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
it
could
be
both
mr.
justice.
in
indiana,
we
adapt
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
discovery.
so
you
have
a
request
for
admission
your
deposition
to
interrogatory’s
everything.
you
could
obtain
your
entire
record
administratively.
by
the
way
which
would
only
take
five
weeks
and
with
the
request
for
admissions
alone,
you
would
establish
a
record
which
the
federal
court
could
review
and
possibly
avoid
a
two,
three,
four
week
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
it
takes
three
weeks,
two
to
three
weeks
to
have
a
hearing
once
you
ask
for
appeal.
and
then
there
is
two
weeks
for
decision.
now,
one
important
thing
about
this
administrative
review
is
once
the
applicant
files
his
appeal
ask
for
appeal,
there
is
nothing
formal
about,
it
is
all
informal,
the
county
is
mandated
to
review
the
situation.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
got
a
disgranted
welfare
applicant
he
says,
they
will
not
accept
my
application
which
they
said
here,
but
which
was
incorrect.
if
that
happens,
all
he
has
to
do
is
informally
ask
for
appeal
and
the
county
has
to
review
it.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
if
the
federal
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no.
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
five
weeks.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
five
weeks
entirely
from
the
--
if
you
go
to
the
states
board
of
public
welfare,
you
go
to
the
state
first
that
takes
five
weeks
and
then
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes.
mr.
justice
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
mr.
justice
and
i
do
not
have
the
pages
right
in
the
appellants
brief
and
their
appendix
on
the
appeal
section
under
the
indiana
procedure
appeal
section.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
it
does
happen
and
it
is
demandated
to
happen.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
five
weeks,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
this
was
a
law
suit
of
the
lawyers
not
the
applicants.
some
of
the
applicants
testifying
court
that
when
they
went
to
the
lawyers
or
the
lawyers
called
them,
they
thought
they
were
administratively
appealing.
they
got
involved
in
the
federal
law
suit
which
took
a
year
practically
to
be
heard
just
on
this
question.
where
they
could
have
administratively
had
that
out
of
the
way
in
five
weeks.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
the
testimony
showed
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
there
was,
all
the
applicant
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
i
do
not
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes
there
was.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
it
was
granted.
dorothy
enoch
one
of
the
claimants
who
said,
i
could
not
get
and
wait
six
months.
she
received
benefits
in
two
months
after
her
husband
left
the
house.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
lucille
hall
received
it
in
a
few
months.
brenda
steel
that
is
one
of
the
claimant
said,
she
said,
i
did
not
even
have
any
need
problems
i
was
living
with
my
post.
but
this
six
months
is
only
a
conclusive
presumption.
in
other
words,
if
the
need
is
there
in
the
absence
that
action
bonafide
you
can
get
it
immediately
and
the
evidence
show
that.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
it
is
given
in
the
case
where
you
see
a
conclusive
presumption,
if
is
it
over
six
months.
in
other
words,
continued
absence
you
got
to
have
certain
period
of
time.
the
question
is
how
long,
is
it
a
day,
week
or
month.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
you
still
have
to
show
need
and
the
evidence
showed
in
which
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
the
testimony
showed
that
the
standard
of
need
actually
applied
was
the
same
if
it
was
less
than
six
months
or
over
six
months.
so
this
equal
protection
argument
is
saying
that
you
depriving
somebody
less
than
six
months
over
six
months
was
completely
refuted.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
before
six
months
if
it
shown
that
it
is
action
bonafide
separation
in
the
need
they
are
immediately
eligible
and
that
is
all
that
the
social
security
act
requires.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
possibly
that
could
be
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
it
is
build-in
administrative
procedure
and
if
you
can
bypass
it
here
and
under
any
1983
claim
then
what
you
are
having
happen
is
the
federal
courts
in
reality
are
becoming
the
welfare
administrators
to
review
every
welfare
claim.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
there
is,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
part
of
witnesses
there
were
five,
i
believe
there
were
nine
witnesses
for
the
claimants
and
the
remaining
or
ten
witnesses
and
remaining
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
counting
the
witnesses
we
put
on
there
were
11.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
seven
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
(inaudible)
received
aid.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
and
i
believe
it
was
in
less
than
six
months
and
no
claim
(inaudible)
called,
i
believe
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
before
they
received
aid
from
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
they
are
receiving
inter
benefits
from
the
trustee.
or
they
were
because
in
indiana
you
can
get
immediately
benefits
from
the
trustees
as
soon
you
walk
in.
so
you
do
not
have
a
situation,
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
mr.
justice
douglas,
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
limited
time,
i
would
like
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
to
the
court
that
the
appellee
wayne
stanton,
his
position
is
that
we
should
not
be
in
the
federal
court.
not
whether
that
we
should
be
in
this
court
so
much
or
whether
or
not
we
should
be
in
the
federal
court
if
the
doctrine
of
abstention
or
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
administrative
remedies
had
any
meaning
under
this
type
of
case.
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
it
is
fully
covered
in
our
briefs,
it
is
fully
covered
with
case
law.
there
were
charges
in
there
that
the
applicants
or
the
claimants
says
we
could
not
file
an
application
unless
we
sued
for
divorce,
unless
we
filed
for
legal
separation.
the
evidence
is
clear
in
fact
two
of
the
claimants
alone
received
benefits
less
than
three
month
after
their
husbands
separated
and
they
never
filed
for
divorce.
there
was
a
witness
smith,
she
testified
that
she
filed
her
application
immediately
and
within
a
month
she
received
aid,
she
never
filed
for
divorce.
there
was
a
witness
blake
laclair
(ph)
she
receive
aid
in
two
months
after
separation,
never
filed
for
divorce.
so
as
far
as
this
six
month
requirement
under
the
indiana
regulation,
all
the
six
month
is
a
guideline.
in
other
words,
after
six
months
is
a
conclusive
presumption.
but
if
the
need
is
there
and
the
absence
is
action
bonafide,
the
regulation
says
that
the
person
can
receive
aid
immediately.
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
damico
and
all
of
the
others
where
was
a
three
month
situation
sue
start.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
the
district
court
held
your
honor
mr.
justice
that
there
was
no
substantial
federal
question
and
the
claimants
did
not
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies
and
therefore
they
said
there
was
no
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
your
honor
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
the
pleadings
alleged
the
regulation
which
says
six
months
and
this
is
statutory.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
your
honor.
what
the
court
did
at
least
in
my
opinion,
they
had
the
pleadings
in
front
and
they
had
the
motions
to
dismiss
and
they
heard
60
witnesses
to
determine
whether
the
court
should
take
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case,
fully
hear
the
case
on
the
merits.
there
was
about
ten
hours
of
testimony
involved
and
after
concluding
that
and
after
hearing
the
evidence
then
they
made
their
conclusion
notes
of
substantial
federal
question
on
the
pleadings
and
the
party
failed
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
your
honor
they
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
mr.
justice
they
did
not.
this
case
is
the
only
case
i
could
find
and
the
only
case
i
know
of
where
this
court
is
faced
now
with
the
decision
to
make
with
respect
to
administrative
remedies.
now
the
appellant
have
cited
king,
they
have
cited
damico,
they
have
cited
damico
and
mcneese.
but
each
of
those
cases,
if
you
look
at
the
merits
of
those
cases,
the
administrative
remedies
involved
there
was
either
not
adequate.
it
was
not
speedy
or
it
would
have
been
feudal.
for
example,
in
mcneese
i
believe
the
parties
would
have
to
go
back
and
get
--
it
was
a
segregation
case,
they
would
have
to
get
%10
of
the
boarder
so
many
people
and
then
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
your
honor
they
just
said
that
there
was
under
1983,
you
did
not
have
the
exhaustment
state
remedy.
what
has
been
causing
confusion
with
the
federal
courts
is
whether
this
--
the
confusion
is
that
if
you
make
a
claim
under
1983,
does
that
give
you
absolute
right
to
bypass
all
administrative
remedies
and
that
is
really
the
question
before
this
court
today.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
mcneese
did
say
this
so.
they
did
say
and
they
are
not
pretty
good
exact
words,
but
they
said,
more
or
less
that
if
the
administrative
remedy
there
is
feudal
or
if
it
would
not
do
any
good,
you
do
not
have
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
my
opinion
your
honor,
in
our
opinion.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
alright
your
honor,
in
answer
to
that
question
the
administrative
procedure
setup
in
indiana
has
a
number
of
means
under
which
you
can
appeal,
administratively
appeal.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
well,
it
says
--
one
of
the
mains
it
says
if
the
applicant
believes
his
civil
or
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated,
he
can
appeal
administratively
and
under
indiana
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
alright,
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
indiana
provides
that
he
may
have
anybody
represent
him.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
who
decides
it?
this
is
a
welfare
administrator,
the
first
step.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
he
is
not.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
he
can
make
a
finding
with
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
he
can
make
finding
whether
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
he
can.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
pardon?
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
i
do
not
know
what
oath
he
takes
mr.
justice,
but
under
the
regulation
if
the
person
believes
his
constitutional
civil
rights
have
been
violated,
he
can
appeal
administratively.
now
if
the
indiana
regulation
was
a
flat
six
month
rule
where
there
was
no
leeway
for
aid
immediately,
then
i
would
say
that
whatever
decision
you
make
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
the
administrative
agency
cannot
make
that
decision.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes
he
is,
but
when
he
filed
his
complaint
with
the
federal
court
on
that,
the
federal
court,
as
interpret
the
entry,
says
there
is
not
a
substantial
constitutional
question
raised
by
this
regulation
and
therefore
the
parties
must
exhaust
their
available
or
administrative
remedies.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
it
is
our
position
that
what
they
have
alleged,
the
applicants
alleged
here.
there
is
a
entire
administrative
process
established
in
indiana
to
handle.
for
example,
one
of
the
application
is
denied
you
can
administratively
appeal
it.
if
it
is
not
acted
upon
a
reasonable
time,
you
can
administratively
appeal
it.
if
your
aid
is
revoked
or
modified
you
can
administratively
appeal
it.
if
you
go
to
a
case
worker
and
he
refuses
to
accept
your
application
you
can
administratively
appeal.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
first
step
mr.
justice
is
a
state
department
of
public
welfare
and
if
the
party
is
still
dissatisfied
then
it
is
reviewed
by
the
state
board
of
public
welfare
upon
his
request.
and
then
the
applicant
can
go
into
either
the
state
of
the
federal
court
depending
on
his
own
choice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
of
his
own,
either
of
his
own
choice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
it
is
our
opinion
your
honor
with
the
available
discovery,
the
entire
record
could
be
brought
into
the
federal
court
order
state.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
it
would
be
de
novo,
a
new
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
it
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
it
could
be
both
mr.
justice.
in
indiana,
we
adapt
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
discovery.
so
you
have
a
request
for
admission
your
deposition
to
interrogatory’s
everything.
you
could
obtain
your
entire
record
administratively.
by
the
way
which
would
only
take
five
weeks
and
with
the
request
for
admissions
alone,
you
would
establish
a
record
which
the
federal
court
could
review
and
possibly
avoid
a
two,
three,
four
week
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
it
takes
three
weeks,
two
to
three
weeks
to
have
a
hearing
once
you
ask
for
appeal.
and
then
there
is
two
weeks
for
decision.
now,
one
important
thing
about
this
administrative
review
is
once
the
applicant
files
his
appeal
ask
for
appeal,
there
is
nothing
formal
about,
it
is
all
informal,
the
county
is
mandated
to
review
the
situation.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
got
a
disgranted
welfare
applicant
he
says,
they
will
not
accept
my
application
which
they
said
here,
but
which
was
incorrect.
if
that
happens,
all
he
has
to
do
is
informally
ask
for
appeal
and
the
county
has
to
review
it.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
if
the
federal
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no.
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
five
weeks.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
five
weeks
entirely
from
the
--
if
you
go
to
the
states
board
of
public
welfare,
you
go
to
the
state
first
that
takes
five
weeks
and
then
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes.
mr.
justice
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
mr.
justice
and
i
do
not
have
the
pages
right
in
the
appellants
brief
and
their
appendix
on
the
appeal
section
under
the
indiana
procedure
appeal
section.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
it
does
happen
and
it
is
demandated
to
happen.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
five
weeks,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
this
was
a
law
suit
of
the
lawyers
not
the
applicants.
some
of
the
applicants
testifying
court
that
when
they
went
to
the
lawyers
or
the
lawyers
called
them,
they
thought
they
were
administratively
appealing.
they
got
involved
in
the
federal
law
suit
which
took
a
year
practically
to
be
heard
just
on
this
question.
where
they
could
have
administratively
had
that
out
of
the
way
in
five
weeks.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
the
testimony
showed
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
there
was,
all
the
applicant
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
i
do
not
understand
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes
there
was.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
it
was
granted.
dorothy
enoch
one
of
the
claimants
who
said,
i
could
not
get
and
wait
six
months.
she
received
benefits
in
two
months
after
her
husband
left
the
house.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
lucille
hall
received
it
in
a
few
months.
brenda
steel
that
is
one
of
the
claimant
said,
she
said,
i
did
not
even
have
any
need
problems
i
was
living
with
my
post.
but
this
six
months
is
only
a
conclusive
presumption.
in
other
words,
if
the
need
is
there
in
the
absence
that
action
bonafide
you
can
get
it
immediately
and
the
evidence
show
that.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
it
is
given
in
the
case
where
you
see
a
conclusive
presumption,
if
is
it
over
six
months.
in
other
words,
continued
absence
you
got
to
have
certain
period
of
time.
the
question
is
how
long,
is
it
a
day,
week
or
month.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
you
still
have
to
show
need
and
the
evidence
showed
in
which
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
the
testimony
showed
that
the
standard
of
need
actually
applied
was
the
same
if
it
was
less
than
six
months
or
over
six
months.
so
this
equal
protection
argument
is
saying
that
you
depriving
somebody
less
than
six
months
over
six
months
was
completely
refuted.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
before
six
months
if
it
shown
that
it
is
action
bonafide
separation
in
the
need
they
are
immediately
eligible
and
that
is
all
that
the
social
security
act
requires.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
possibly
that
could
be
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
it
is
build-in
administrative
procedure
and
if
you
can
bypass
it
here
and
under
any
1983
claim
then
what
you
are
having
happen
is
the
federal
courts
in
reality
are
becoming
the
welfare
administrators
to
review
every
welfare
claim.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
yes,
there
is,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
part
of
witnesses
there
were
five,
i
believe
there
were
nine
witnesses
for
the
claimants
and
the
remaining
or
ten
witnesses
and
remaining
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
counting
the
witnesses
we
put
on
there
were
11.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
seven
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
(inaudible)
received
aid.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
and
i
believe
it
was
in
less
than
six
months
and
no
claim
(inaudible)
called,
i
believe
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
no,
before
they
received
aid
from
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
geddes
they
are
receiving
inter
benefits
from
the
trustee.
or
they
were
because
in
indiana
you
can
get
immediately
benefits
from
the
trustees
as
soon
you
walk
in.
so
you
do
not
have
a
situation,
thank
you.
