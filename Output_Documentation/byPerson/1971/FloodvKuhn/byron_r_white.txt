justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
practical
matter,
he
had
no
real
chance
remaining
in
st.
louis
and
negotiating
another
controversy
with
st.
louis,
he
would
have
had
to
go
to
one
on
the
other
teams
even
if
he
had
been
to
the
reserve
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it's
not
legal,
if
st.
louis
is
trading
him,
regardless
of
the
reserve
clause
they
are
not
going
to
negotiate
another
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
justice
said
just
before
you
start
on
that,
do
you
think
federal
baseball
and
toolson
indicated
that
the
baseball
was
not
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
or
is
it
that
labor
isn't
an
article
of
commerce,
service
is
not
article
of
commerce
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
than
the
intent
of
congress,
would
you
just
say
that
labor
is
an
article
of
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
flood
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
anyways
--
i
gather
radovich
settled
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
go
to
whether
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
rather
than
to
coverage?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
beg
your
pardon
you
just
said
this
litigation
was
brought
by
the
players
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
really
saying
this
is
their
law
suit
not
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your
position
that
baseball
is
not
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
extent
numbers
of
players
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
taking
the
same
position
that
the
plaintiff
here
were
a
minor
league
player?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
players
aren't
--
the
minor
league
players
at
terms
aren't
settled
by
the
bargaining
between
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then
your
position
would
not
be
the
same
if
this
is
a
point
on
the
plaintiff.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
say
at
this
point
would
you
comment
as
to
why
baseball
moved
to
extend
the
--
why
did
it
move
into
the
draft
system
in
1965,
to
the
new
player?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
bonus
system
itself
didn't
come
into
effect
until
fairly
recently?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
are
the
first
bonuses
paid?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
issue
here
whether
the
reserve
clause
violates
the
antitrust
laws.
i
didn't
know
that.
the
issue
here
was
whether
you're
exempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
believe
that
you
could
lose
the
issue
here,
that
is
here
on
coverage
and
still
win
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
reserve
system
under
the
antitrust
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
is
something
unique
in
the
union
representing
the
great
range
of
baseball
players,
all
of
them
being
neglected
bargaining
agent
for
all
of
the
players
in
a
unit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
report
to
reach
the
question
of
salary?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
unions
usually
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
it
doesn't
adhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
with
you?
you
put
it
on
the
bargaining
table.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
because
players
are
too
different
one
from
another
for
one
union
to
represent.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
rest
of
the
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
the
same
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
while
the
union
feels
that
if
in
a
new
field
apparently,
that
you
and
the
union
really
shouldn't
set
salaries
which
is
usually
the
subject
of
collective
bargaining.
you
should
be
able
to
agree
on
a
reserve
system
that
applies
the
same
to
everybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
players
are
different
one
from
another
and
their
relationships
are
collaborative--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
for
the
moment
that
both
players
and
management
as
they
do
say
pay
out
as
a
collective
bargaining
issue.
that's
going
to
be
left
to
individual
bargaining.
and
then
the
owners
among
themselves
agree
on
a
range,
on
some
maximums.
we
will
not
pay
anybody,
no
matter
who
it
is,
more
than
a
$100,000
a
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
assume
you
did.
let's
assume
you
did.
because
that's
one
of
the
suggested
alternatives
of
course
to
a
reserve
system.
there
going
to
have
to
be
some
maximums.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
then
you
wouldn't
do
that
because
you
think
that
would
be
improper.
justice
byron
r.
white
such
as
violating
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
let's
pursue
that.
i
just
want
to
get
your
position
clear.
if
the
owners
agree
on
a
max
$100,000
a
year,
against
the
background
where
both
labor
and
management
had
put
it
aside
as
a
bargaining
issue
that,
you
say
that
would
not
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
if
they
(inaudible)
among
the
owners
as
to
what
they
would
pay
their
players.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
let's
assume,
put
it
the
way
you
want.
you
had
agreed
not
to
bargain
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
because
of
the
labor
exemption.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
labor
exemption,
because
of
the
basic
exemption
to
baseball
antitrust
laws.
of
course
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
suggesting
that
this
judgment
below
would
be
upheld
on
the
grounds
not
reached
below?
justice
byron

white
do
you
think
the

is
adequate
for
that
ground?
justice
byron

you
would
oppose
the
remand.
i

on

it

you
