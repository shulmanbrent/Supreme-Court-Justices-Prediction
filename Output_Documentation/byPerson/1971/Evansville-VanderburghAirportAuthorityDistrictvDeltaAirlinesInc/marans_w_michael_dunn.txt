mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
particular
case
which
we
are
discussing
now,
the
new
hampshire
statute,
chapter
391
is
different
from
the
previous
case,
at
least
in
form
and
in
fact
i
think
it's
different
in
substance.
chapter
391
levies
against
a
scheduled
air
passenger
carrier,
a
service
fee
for
the
use
of
the
state's
facilities.
now
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
here
that
our
airports
in
new
hampshire
are
very
similar
to
the
--
currently
the
indiana
airport.
we
have
three
airport
authorities
with
which
we
are
concerned
here
and
two
municipalities.
but
for
the
most
part,
the
expense
of
the
airport,
the
operating
expense
and
to
a
large
extent
the
capital
improvement
expense
is
carried
directly
by
the
municipality
or
by
the
airport
authority
by
some
sort
of,
in
that
particular
situation
a
property
tax
for
the
most
part.
the
aeronautics
commission
through
--
the
legislature
does
appropriate
money
for
various
activities
at
the
airport,
and
the
aeronautics
commission
has
money
that
it
receives
through
fees
and
so
forth,
which
is
expended
to
these
airports.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right,
that's
state-wide.
however,
this
fee
only
affects
at
the
present
time
five
airports
and
before
a
fee
is
collected
at
these
airports,
it's
a
condition
precedent,
that
both
the
state
and
the
municipality
or
the
airport
authority
contribute
money
to
the
operating
expenses
or
construction
expenses,
not
just
one
of
them.
the
statute
is
set
out,
it
is
a
levy
against
the
carrier
in
it's
terms,
the
attorney
general
is
authorized
to
--
in
a
civil
suit
to
sue
the
carrier,
if
the
carrier
does
not
remit
the
service
fee,
returns
are
made
by
the
carrier.
the
proceeds
are
to
go,
50%
to
the
airport
authority
or
municipality
from
which
the
fee
is
measured
and
50%
to
the
aeronautics
commission
or
to
the
treasury
to
be
covered
into
the
aeronautical
fund.
now,
this
aeronautical
fund
can
only
be
used
for
air
navigational
aids.
now
the
money
that
goes
to
the
municipality
for
the
airport
authority
for
the
most
part,
i
tend
to
agree
there
was
not
a
restriction
that
it
must
be
used
for
air
navigational
aids
as
such.
but
as
you
look
at
the
total
picture,
they
are
paying
most
of
the
bill
to
the
airport
anyway
and
the
fee
would
never
replenish
the
amount
that
they
are
paying
out.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
not
in
my
opinion,
because
the
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
unfortunately,
the
tax
was
not
--
the
landing
or
service
fee
was
not
tax
on
the
basis
that
it
was
excessive,
so
there
was
no
record
whatsoever.
now
that
we
come
in
and
prove
that
it
was
not,
it
was
never
attacked.
i
think
without
doubt
we
could
show
that
it's
not
excessive
at
all.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
they
certainly
contributed
more
than
they
were
receiving
before
and
there
is
certainly
too
with
regard
to
the
municipality
that
a
trip
contributing
more
than
they
are
going
to
get
out
of
this
tax.
with
the
regard
to
the
aeronautical
fund
perhaps
there
might
be
some
money
that
could
come
in
but
it
must
be
used
to
maintain
or
operate.
if
there
is
any
surplus,
it
must
be
used
for
air
navigational
aids.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
no,
not
really
and
the
reason
is
it
was
not
attacked
as
excessive
and
there
was
--
the
state
had
no
burden
in
my
opinion
of
showing
how
the
money
was
actually
used
and
proving
in
fact
that
it
was
not
excessive.
now
the
fee
under
the
new
hampshire
statute,
the
fee
is
against
the
air
carrier
for
the
use
of
state
and
municipally
funded
facilities,
and
it
is
measured
by
two
criteria,
the
weight
of
the
aircraft,
and
the
benefit
for
right
of
the
carrier
in
terms
of
the
number
of
enplanements,
or
the
number
of
people
who
would
get
on
it.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
a
question
that
was
posed
by
mr.
justice
white
and
discussed
further
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
yesterday,
with
regard
to
the
indiana
case.
and
the
question
was,
why
not
simply
increase
the
landing
fees?
now,
the
new
hampshire
answer
to
that
question,
because
it
does
seem
like
a
far
more
simple
thing
to
do
without
perhaps
any
constitutional
problems,
was
posed
to
the
commission
and
their
answer
was
this.
this
would
be
an
inequitable
burden
against
the
air
carrier
to
simply
double
or
triple
the
landing
fee.
now,
the
fact
that
we
are
opposing
each
other
here
and
the
fact
that
the
state
indicates
that
the
fee
is
constitutionally
airlines
in
the
case
that
it
is
not,
does
not
mean
that
there
is
not
some
harmony
with
the
regard
to
the
aeronautics
commission
and
the
airlines.
we
do
not
want
to
burden
the
airlines
to
such
an
extent
they
cannot
do
business
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
because
the
airlines,
as
the
aeronautics
commission
have
looked
at
it,
cannot
afford
to
have
their
landing
fee
doubled
or
tripled,
at
this
point.
therefore,
they
instead
indicated
that
they
would
rather
have
this
sort
of
a
used
fee,
which
would
allow
the
airlines
to
grow
and
would
not
immediately
tomorrow
or
a
year
ago
double
the
cost
of
doing
businesses
on
laconia
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right,
perhaps
it’s
practical.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
no,
as
far
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now
there
is
no
doubt
that
under
the
new
hampshire
statute
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
right.
i
am
now
speaking
for
the
commission,
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
commission
and
i
am
--
the
answer
that
was
given
to
me
was
that
it
would
be
too
burdensome
on
the
to
double
or
triple
rate.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now
i
think,
it's
not,
it
not
easy
if
you
were
to
pay
the
dollar
to
the
northeast
airlines,
however,
in
the
end,
i
think
[voice
overlap].
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
i
am
not
--
i
think
the
real
problem
is
the
fact
that
the
landing
fees
are
negotiated.
they
are
apparently
an
extremely
touching
subject.
they
are
frequently
renegotiated
as
the
certified
air
carrier
relinquishes
its
commitment
to
a
lower
class
carrier
and
they
are
extremely
touching
and
the
practical
problem
is
that
service,
they
fear
their
service
will
diminish
considerably
if
a
double
or
triple
landing
fees
is
imposed.
it's
very,
very
touchy
area.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
the
ultimate
burden
on
the
airline,
i
think
ultimately
will
be
the
same.
however
under
the
new
hampshire
statutory
scheme,
as
more
people
use
the
airline,
the
burden
will
become
somewhat
greater.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes.
now
the
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
oh!
no.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
no,
our
law
says
nothing
herein
shall
prohibit
such
fee
from
being
passed
onto
the
customer.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
now
that's
--
the
two
appellants
are
passing
it
on,
yes,
but
with
regard
to
the
other
air
carriers
that
are
not
litigating
this
matter,
one
air
carrier
is
not
passing
it
on
and
one
air
carrier
is.
now,
as
far
as
passing
on
this
particular
dollar
fee,
the
statute
simply
levies
a
charge
measured
by
two
items
now,
the
weight
of
the
carrier
and
the
number
of
people
that
get
on.
now,
they
may
very
well
pass
it
on
or
they
might
not
pass
it
on.
i
think
after
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes,
i
would
agree
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
--
if
they
do
pass
it
on.
however,
if
their
expenses
are
going
to
increase
necessarily
for
a
short
time
and
their
profits
will
diminish
if
there
is
a
landing
but
a
landing
fee
however,
it
will
be
raised,
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now
it
would,
perhaps.
i
mean
i
think
that's
--
they
certainly
may
get
a
rate
increased
out
of
cab,
that
is
beyond
--
we
cannot
control
that.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
i
would
agree
with
it.
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
this
tax
is
levied
against
the
air
passenger
carrier
and
against
the
contract
carrier
which
is
not
in
litigation
here,
there
is
particularly
is
good
reason
for
this.
number
1,
that
the
carriers
derive
their
livelihood,
they
use
regulatory
routes,
they
are
in
and
out
all
the
time.
and
secondly,
all
of
the
expansion
in
the
new
hampshire
airports
can
almost
be
traced
directly
to
the
change
of
facilities
of
the
air
carrier.
for
instance,
the
dc-3,
it
was
changed
to
the
dc-6.
it
needed
a
longer
runway
and
now
that
i
believe
they
are
changing
to
a
dc-9.
the
change
of
facilities
of
the
air
carriers
appears
to
be
one
step
ahead
of
the
change
of
the
airport.
so
most
of
the
capital
expense
and
a
great
deal
of
the
operating
expense
is
directly
due
to
the
fact
that
these
airports
are
used
by
commercial
air
carriers.
number
2,
is
the
safety
devices
that
must
be
maintained
because
the
cargo
here
is
passengers,
and
this
is
--
although
some
safety
devices
of
course
would
be
there
even
if
they
had
non-commercial
flights.
i
think
it
would
definitely
be
increased
by
the
fact
that
you
have
the
commercial
flights.
i
think
when
this
statute
is
analyzed,
it
is
possible
to
look
at
it
as
a
correct
and
proper
use
fee
levied
against
the
carrier
measured
by
the
weight
of
the
--
measured
by
two
criteria,
the
weight
of
the
carrier,
that
is
the
wear
and
tear
presumptively
on
the
runway,
and
number
2,
the
benefit
provided
by
the
use
of
the
facility.
now
the
benefit
might
not
necessarily
be
equivalent
to
the
number
of
times
they
land,
particularly
in
new
hampshire,
or
laconia
or
berlin.
they
may
very
well
land
and
takeoff
with
no
one.
they
may
have
not
received
a
terrific
benefit,
they
may
land
in
manchester
and
pick
up
more
people.
so
the
benefit
here
is
and
the
fact
number
1,
the
use,
the
wear
and
tear,
the
weight
of
the
aircraft,
and
the
benefit
is
reflected
by
actually
the
number
of
people
that
they
pick
up.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes,
you
are
right.
however,
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
about
the
characterization
as
a
take-off
fee.
it
is
our
opinion
and
contention
that
this
is
a
simple
way
to
measure
the
benefit
derived
and
it
would
be
immaterial
for
instance
whether
we
call
it
a
deplaning
fee
or
an
enplaning
fee,
or
a
take-off
fee
or
whatever
because
we're
only
using
it
as
a
yardstick
to
measure
the
benefit.
therefore,
in
my
opinion,
it
would
be
excessive
for
instance
for
us
to
tax
the
enplanements,
and
then
tender
a
tax
on
deplanements
and
so
forth,
because
the
benefit
would
then
be
doubled
and
it
would
be
out
of
proportion.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that
is
our
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right.
the
two
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
among
certain,
it
is
a
week-to-week
basis.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
i
think
executive
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
there
are
contract
carriers
and
they
are
well
--
there
is
a
change
in
the
--
however
they
are
not
taxed
or
the
use
fee
does
not
apply
if
they
are
under
a
certain
weight.
but,
if
they
are
a
large
contract
carrier,
it
applies
and
they
pay
use
fee,
some
absorb
the
fee
and
some
do
not.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
no,
i
do
not
think.
there
has
been
--
they
were
suggesting
in
the
brief
that
--
i
mean,
perhaps
i
should
say
yes.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
the
brief
that
congress
because
of
the
need
for
uniformity
has
a
right
to
speak
and
even
though
they
have
not
spoken
in
the
sense
that
they
can
make
the
rights
that
are
demanded,
they
have
been
made
for
all.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
as
it
was
regard
to
the
state
law
and
in
my
opinion,
it
was
recently
regard
to
the
constitutional,
well
--
i
think
they
could
pass
it.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right.
now,
the
answer
is
i
do
not
know
if
they
are
forbidden
by
the
cab
to
pass
on.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
i
would.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
rather
than
a
landing
fee
or
other
than
an
enplanement
fee?
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
you
mean
an
enplanement
fee
as
we
are
discussing
here?
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yeah,
i
agree.
i
agree.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now,
i
could
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
an
administrative
problem
or
if
it
is
a
legal
problem.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
i
am
certain
they
will,
i
am
certain
they
will.
now,
i
think
it
could
be
argued
by,
perhaps
by
someone
who
is
in
a
position
to
do
so
that
they
shouldn't
pass
it
onto
the
passengers.
now,
our
statute
in
no
way
tells
them
or
demands
that
they
do
pass
it
on.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now,
my
answer
is
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
or
is
not
consistent.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
in
the
sense,
no.
i
would
even
say
no,
it
does
not
authorize
them,
so
it
says
nothing
herein
shall
prevent
them
from
doing,
as
it
is
as
if
nothing
was
said
whatsoever.
now,
i
am
talking
about
new
hampshire
law.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
we
are,
that's
right,
absolutely.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes.
well,
we
say
that
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes.
that
is
our
position.
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
demanding
that
they
pass
it
on,
and
we
don't
restrict
the
fact
that
they
are
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
oh!
yes.
in
my
opinion
we
are
considerably
different
from
the
indiana
case.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
true.
that
would
be
my
--
the
new
hampshire
statute
and
the
statutory
scheme
which
was
--
we
attempted
--
that
the
legislature
attempted
to
pass,
simply
is
a
use
fee
against
a
carrier
non-discriminantly
imposed
that
is
against
all
carriers
whether
intrastate
or
interstate,
whether
the
flight
is
intrastate
or
whether
the
flight
is
interstate.
for
the
benefits
they
have
received
and
will
receive,
all
of
the
funds,
all
of
the
funds
of
the
state
receives
must
go
to
air
navigational
aid
and
regard
to
the
funds,
regard
to
the
municipality,
that
simply
either
goes
to
air
navigational
aid
or
replaces
money
that
has
been
spent
for
air
navigational
aid.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
it
is
my
opinion
that
they
are
passing
the
tax
on
in
my
assumption
from
the
last
time
i
find
from
the
case.
the
new
hampshire
position
simply
is
this
is
a
use
fee
against
the
airline,
non-discriminantly
imposed
and
it
is
not
excessive,
and
it
is
not
necessarily
a
fee
against
a
passenger.
nor
we
all
do
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
no,
in
my
opinion
we
couldn't
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
not
under
the
statute,
no
and
we
do
not
force
them
to
pass
it
on.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
we
have
in
my
opinion,
what
i
know
about
fix
based
operators
at
some
of
the
airports.
they
do
work
on
airplanes,
they
pay
a
fee.
we
have
a
fee
with
regard
to
landing
of
general
aviation.
now,
that
fee
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
private
planes.
now,
that
fee
is
remarkable
as
it
seems
is
about
8
times
greater
at
some
airports
than
the
landing
fee
with
regard
to
the
commercial
aviation.
it
is
a
quite
a
bit
more
than
landed
general
private
plane
for
a
landing.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now
this
--
i
agree.
now,
this
is
not
necessarily
a
legal
point
and
i
do
not
even
think
it
is
a
constitutional
point
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
but
it
is
an
extremely
valid
practical
point
that
these
are
negotiated
and
they
are
terrifically
afraid
of,
terrifically
poor
service
if
the
landing
fee
is
too
high.
now,
this
is
just
a
fact
of
life
with
which
the
aeronautics
commission
and
the
municipalities
and
the
airport
authorities
are
faced
with.
with
regard
to
other
fees
at
the
airport,
there
are
rentals
at
some
airport
which
is
no
different
than
any
other
building
which
rents
space.
but,
the
interesting
point
is
that
where
--
for
instance
at
lebanon,
a
landing
fee
for
a
scheduled
passenger
carrier
might
be
approximately
$1.67
per
landing.
it
would
be
for
the
same
carrier
over
$12,512
for
general
aviation
aircraft
to
land.
so
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
harmony
between
the
municipalities
and
the
air
carriers.
we
need
--
we
want
their
business,
we
need
their
facilities
where
we
are
trying
to
provide
facilities
further.
this
is
not
a
necessarily,
strictly
advisory
thing
when
you
get
out
of
the
airport
so
to
speak.
this
is
strictly
a
use
fee
levied
against
a
carrier
for
facilities
provided.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
particular
case
which
we
are
discussing
now,
the
new
hampshire
statute,
chapter
391
is
different
from
the
previous
case,
at
least
in
form
and
in
fact
i
think
it's
different
in
substance.
chapter
391
levies
against
a
scheduled
air
passenger
carrier,
a
service
fee
for
the
use
of
the
state's
facilities.
now
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
here
that
our
airports
in
new
hampshire
are
very
similar
to
the
--
currently
the
indiana
airport.
we
have
three
airport
authorities
with
which
we
are
concerned
here
and
two
municipalities.
but
for
the
most
part,
the
expense
of
the
airport,
the
operating
expense
and
to
a
large
extent
the
capital
improvement
expense
is
carried
directly
by
the
municipality
or
by
the
airport
authority
by
some
sort
of,
in
that
particular
situation
a
property
tax
for
the
most
part.
the
aeronautics
commission
through
--
the
legislature
does
appropriate
money
for
various
activities
at
the
airport,
and
the
aeronautics
commission
has
money
that
it
receives
through
fees
and
so
forth,
which
is
expended
to
these
airports.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right,
that's
state-wide.
however,
this
fee
only
affects
at
the
present
time
five
airports
and
before
a
fee
is
collected
at
these
airports,
it's
a
condition
precedent,
that
both
the
state
and
the
municipality
or
the
airport
authority
contribute
money
to
the
operating
expenses
or
construction
expenses,
not
just
one
of
them.
the
statute
is
set
out,
it
is
a
levy
against
the
carrier
in
it's
terms,
the
attorney
general
is
authorized
to
--
in
a
civil
suit
to
sue
the
carrier,
if
the
carrier
does
not
remit
the
service
fee,
returns
are
made
by
the
carrier.
the
proceeds
are
to
go,
50%
to
the
airport
authority
or
municipality
from
which
the
fee
is
measured
and
50%
to
the
aeronautics
commission
or
to
the
treasury
to
be
covered
into
the
aeronautical
fund.
now,
this
aeronautical
fund
can
only
be
used
for
air
navigational
aids.
now
the
money
that
goes
to
the
municipality
for
the
airport
authority
for
the
most
part,
i
tend
to
agree
there
was
not
a
restriction
that
it
must
be
used
for
air
navigational
aids
as
such.
but
as
you
look
at
the
total
picture,
they
are
paying
most
of
the
bill
to
the
airport
anyway
and
the
fee
would
never
replenish
the
amount
that
they
are
paying
out.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
not
in
my
opinion,
because
the
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
unfortunately,
the
tax
was
not
--
the
landing
or
service
fee
was
not
tax
on
the
basis
that
it
was
excessive,
so
there
was
no
record
whatsoever.
now
that
we
come
in
and
prove
that
it
was
not,
it
was
never
attacked.
i
think
without
doubt
we
could
show
that
it's
not
excessive
at
all.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
they
certainly
contributed
more
than
they
were
receiving
before
and
there
is
certainly
too
with
regard
to
the
municipality
that
a
trip
contributing
more
than
they
are
going
to
get
out
of
this
tax.
with
the
regard
to
the
aeronautical
fund
perhaps
there
might
be
some
money
that
could
come
in
but
it
must
be
used
to
maintain
or
operate.
if
there
is
any
surplus,
it
must
be
used
for
air
navigational
aids.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
no,
not
really
and
the
reason
is
it
was
not
attacked
as
excessive
and
there
was
--
the
state
had
no
burden
in
my
opinion
of
showing
how
the
money
was
actually
used
and
proving
in
fact
that
it
was
not
excessive.
now
the
fee
under
the
new
hampshire
statute,
the
fee
is
against
the
air
carrier
for
the
use
of
state
and
municipally
funded
facilities,
and
it
is
measured
by
two
criteria,
the
weight
of
the
aircraft,
and
the
benefit
for
right
of
the
carrier
in
terms
of
the
number
of
enplanements,
or
the
number
of
people
who
would
get
on
it.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
a
question
that
was
posed
by
mr.
justice
white
and
discussed
further
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
yesterday,
with
regard
to
the
indiana
case.
and
the
question
was,
why
not
simply
increase
the
landing
fees?
now,
the
new
hampshire
answer
to
that
question,
because
it
does
seem
like
a
far
more
simple
thing
to
do
without
perhaps
any
constitutional
problems,
was
posed
to
the
commission
and
their
answer
was
this.
this
would
be
an
inequitable
burden
against
the
air
carrier
to
simply
double
or
triple
the
landing
fee.
now,
the
fact
that
we
are
opposing
each
other
here
and
the
fact
that
the
state
indicates
that
the
fee
is
constitutionally
airlines
in
the
case
that
it
is
not,
does
not
mean
that
there
is
not
some
harmony
with
the
regard
to
the
aeronautics
commission
and
the
airlines.
we
do
not
want
to
burden
the
airlines
to
such
an
extent
they
cannot
do
business
in
new
hampshire.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
because
the
airlines,
as
the
aeronautics
commission
have
looked
at
it,
cannot
afford
to
have
their
landing
fee
doubled
or
tripled,
at
this
point.
therefore,
they
instead
indicated
that
they
would
rather
have
this
sort
of
a
used
fee,
which
would
allow
the
airlines
to
grow
and
would
not
immediately
tomorrow
or
a
year
ago
double
the
cost
of
doing
businesses
on
laconia
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right,
perhaps
it’s
practical.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
no,
as
far
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now
there
is
no
doubt
that
under
the
new
hampshire
statute
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
right.
i
am
now
speaking
for
the
commission,
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
commission
and
i
am
--
the
answer
that
was
given
to
me
was
that
it
would
be
too
burdensome
on
the
to
double
or
triple
rate.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now
i
think,
it's
not,
it
not
easy
if
you
were
to
pay
the
dollar
to
the
northeast
airlines,
however,
in
the
end,
i
think
[voice
overlap].
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
i
am
not
--
i
think
the
real
problem
is
the
fact
that
the
landing
fees
are
negotiated.
they
are
apparently
an
extremely
touching
subject.
they
are
frequently
renegotiated
as
the
certified
air
carrier
relinquishes
its
commitment
to
a
lower
class
carrier
and
they
are
extremely
touching
and
the
practical
problem
is
that
service,
they
fear
their
service
will
diminish
considerably
if
a
double
or
triple
landing
fees
is
imposed.
it's
very,
very
touchy
area.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
the
ultimate
burden
on
the
airline,
i
think
ultimately
will
be
the
same.
however
under
the
new
hampshire
statutory
scheme,
as
more
people
use
the
airline,
the
burden
will
become
somewhat
greater.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes.
now
the
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
oh!
no.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
no,
our
law
says
nothing
herein
shall
prohibit
such
fee
from
being
passed
onto
the
customer.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
now
that's
--
the
two
appellants
are
passing
it
on,
yes,
but
with
regard
to
the
other
air
carriers
that
are
not
litigating
this
matter,
one
air
carrier
is
not
passing
it
on
and
one
air
carrier
is.
now,
as
far
as
passing
on
this
particular
dollar
fee,
the
statute
simply
levies
a
charge
measured
by
two
items
now,
the
weight
of
the
carrier
and
the
number
of
people
that
get
on.
now,
they
may
very
well
pass
it
on
or
they
might
not
pass
it
on.
i
think
after
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes,
i
would
agree
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
--
if
they
do
pass
it
on.
however,
if
their
expenses
are
going
to
increase
necessarily
for
a
short
time
and
their
profits
will
diminish
if
there
is
a
landing
but
a
landing
fee
however,
it
will
be
raised,
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now
it
would,
perhaps.
i
mean
i
think
that's
--
they
certainly
may
get
a
rate
increased
out
of
cab,
that
is
beyond
--
we
cannot
control
that.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
i
would
agree
with
it.
with
regard
to
the
fact
that
this
tax
is
levied
against
the
air
passenger
carrier
and
against
the
contract
carrier
which
is
not
in
litigation
here,
there
is
particularly
is
good
reason
for
this.
number
1,
that
the
carriers
derive
their
livelihood,
they
use
regulatory
routes,
they
are
in
and
out
all
the
time.
and
secondly,
all
of
the
expansion
in
the
new
hampshire
airports
can
almost
be
traced
directly
to
the
change
of
facilities
of
the
air
carrier.
for
instance,
the
dc-3,
it
was
changed
to
the
dc-6.
it
needed
a
longer
runway
and
now
that
i
believe
they
are
changing
to
a
dc-9.
the
change
of
facilities
of
the
air
carriers
appears
to
be
one
step
ahead
of
the
change
of
the
airport.
so
most
of
the
capital
expense
and
a
great
deal
of
the
operating
expense
is
directly
due
to
the
fact
that
these
airports
are
used
by
commercial
air
carriers.
number
2,
is
the
safety
devices
that
must
be
maintained
because
the
cargo
here
is
passengers,
and
this
is
--
although
some
safety
devices
of
course
would
be
there
even
if
they
had
non-commercial
flights.
i
think
it
would
definitely
be
increased
by
the
fact
that
you
have
the
commercial
flights.
i
think
when
this
statute
is
analyzed,
it
is
possible
to
look
at
it
as
a
correct
and
proper
use
fee
levied
against
the
carrier
measured
by
the
weight
of
the
--
measured
by
two
criteria,
the
weight
of
the
carrier,
that
is
the
wear
and
tear
presumptively
on
the
runway,
and
number
2,
the
benefit
provided
by
the
use
of
the
facility.
now
the
benefit
might
not
necessarily
be
equivalent
to
the
number
of
times
they
land,
particularly
in
new
hampshire,
or
laconia
or
berlin.
they
may
very
well
land
and
takeoff
with
no
one.
they
may
have
not
received
a
terrific
benefit,
they
may
land
in
manchester
and
pick
up
more
people.
so
the
benefit
here
is
and
the
fact
number
1,
the
use,
the
wear
and
tear,
the
weight
of
the
aircraft,
and
the
benefit
is
reflected
by
actually
the
number
of
people
that
they
pick
up.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes,
you
are
right.
however,
i
would
like
to
make
one
comment
about
the
characterization
as
a
take-off
fee.
it
is
our
opinion
and
contention
that
this
is
a
simple
way
to
measure
the
benefit
derived
and
it
would
be
immaterial
for
instance
whether
we
call
it
a
deplaning
fee
or
an
enplaning
fee,
or
a
take-off
fee
or
whatever
because
we're
only
using
it
as
a
yardstick
to
measure
the
benefit.
therefore,
in
my
opinion,
it
would
be
excessive
for
instance
for
us
to
tax
the
enplanements,
and
then
tender
a
tax
on
deplanements
and
so
forth,
because
the
benefit
would
then
be
doubled
and
it
would
be
out
of
proportion.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that
is
our
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right.
the
two
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
among
certain,
it
is
a
week-to-week
basis.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
i
think
executive
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
there
are
contract
carriers
and
they
are
well
--
there
is
a
change
in
the
--
however
they
are
not
taxed
or
the
use
fee
does
not
apply
if
they
are
under
a
certain
weight.
but,
if
they
are
a
large
contract
carrier,
it
applies
and
they
pay
use
fee,
some
absorb
the
fee
and
some
do
not.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
no,
i
do
not
think.
there
has
been
--
they
were
suggesting
in
the
brief
that
--
i
mean,
perhaps
i
should
say
yes.
there
was
a
suggestion
in
the
brief
that
congress
because
of
the
need
for
uniformity
has
a
right
to
speak
and
even
though
they
have
not
spoken
in
the
sense
that
they
can
make
the
rights
that
are
demanded,
they
have
been
made
for
all.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
as
it
was
regard
to
the
state
law
and
in
my
opinion,
it
was
recently
regard
to
the
constitutional,
well
--
i
think
they
could
pass
it.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right.
now,
the
answer
is
i
do
not
know
if
they
are
forbidden
by
the
cab
to
pass
on.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
i
would.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
rather
than
a
landing
fee
or
other
than
an
enplanement
fee?
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
you
mean
an
enplanement
fee
as
we
are
discussing
here?
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yeah,
i
agree.
i
agree.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now,
i
could
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
an
administrative
problem
or
if
it
is
a
legal
problem.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
i
am
certain
they
will,
i
am
certain
they
will.
now,
i
think
it
could
be
argued
by,
perhaps
by
someone
who
is
in
a
position
to
do
so
that
they
shouldn't
pass
it
onto
the
passengers.
now,
our
statute
in
no
way
tells
them
or
demands
that
they
do
pass
it
on.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now,
my
answer
is
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
or
is
not
consistent.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
in
the
sense,
no.
i
would
even
say
no,
it
does
not
authorize
them,
so
it
says
nothing
herein
shall
prevent
them
from
doing,
as
it
is
as
if
nothing
was
said
whatsoever.
now,
i
am
talking
about
new
hampshire
law.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
we
are,
that's
right,
absolutely.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes.
well,
we
say
that
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
yes.
that
is
our
position.
we
are
not
--
we
are
not
demanding
that
they
pass
it
on,
and
we
don't
restrict
the
fact
that
they
are
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
oh!
yes.
in
my
opinion
we
are
considerably
different
from
the
indiana
case.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
true.
that
would
be
my
--
the
new
hampshire
statute
and
the
statutory
scheme
which
was
--
we
attempted
--
that
the
legislature
attempted
to
pass,
simply
is
a
use
fee
against
a
carrier
non-discriminantly
imposed
that
is
against
all
carriers
whether
intrastate
or
interstate,
whether
the
flight
is
intrastate
or
whether
the
flight
is
interstate.
for
the
benefits
they
have
received
and
will
receive,
all
of
the
funds,
all
of
the
funds
of
the
state
receives
must
go
to
air
navigational
aid
and
regard
to
the
funds,
regard
to
the
municipality,
that
simply
either
goes
to
air
navigational
aid
or
replaces
money
that
has
been
spent
for
air
navigational
aid.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
it
is
my
opinion
that
they
are
passing
the
tax
on
in
my
assumption
from
the
last
time
i
find
from
the
case.
the
new
hampshire
position
simply
is
this
is
a
use
fee
against
the
airline,
non-discriminantly
imposed
and
it
is
not
excessive,
and
it
is
not
necessarily
a
fee
against
a
passenger.
nor
we
all
do
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
that's
right.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
no,
in
my
opinion
we
couldn't
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
not
under
the
statute,
no
and
we
do
not
force
them
to
pass
it
on.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
well,
we
have
in
my
opinion,
what
i
know
about
fix
based
operators
at
some
of
the
airports.
they
do
work
on
airplanes,
they
pay
a
fee.
we
have
a
fee
with
regard
to
landing
of
general
aviation.
now,
that
fee
--
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
private
planes.
now,
that
fee
is
remarkable
as
it
seems
is
about
8
times
greater
at
some
airports
than
the
landing
fee
with
regard
to
the
commercial
aviation.
it
is
a
quite
a
bit
more
than
landed
general
private
plane
for
a
landing.
mr.
marans.
w.
michael
dunn
now
this
--
i
agree.
now,
this
is
not
necessarily
a
legal
point
and
i
do
not
even
think
it
is
a
constitutional
point
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
but
it
is
an
extremely
valid
practical
point
that
these
are
negotiated
and
they
are
terrifically
afraid
of,
terrifically
poor
service
if
the
landing
fee
is
too
high.
now,
this
is
just
a
fact
of
life
with
which
the
aeronautics
commission
and
the
municipalities
and
the
airport
authorities
are
faced
with.
with
regard
to
other
fees
at
the
airport,
there
are
rentals
at
some
airport
which
is
no
different
than
any
other
building
which
rents
space.
but,
the
interesting
point
is
that
where
--
for
instance
at
lebanon,
a
landing
fee
for
a
scheduled
passenger
carrier
might
be
approximately
$1.67
per
landing.
it
would
be
for
the
same
carrier
over
$12,512
for
general
aviation
aircraft
to
land.
so
that
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
harmony
between
the
municipalities
and
the
air
carriers.
we
need
--
we
want
their
business,
we
need
their
facilities
where
we
are
trying
to
provide
facilities
further.
this
is
not
a
necessarily,
strictly
advisory
thing
when
you
get
out
of
the
airport
so
to
speak.
this
is
strictly
a
use
fee
levied
against
a
carrier
for
facilities
provided.
