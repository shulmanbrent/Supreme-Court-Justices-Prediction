justice
david
h.
souter
your
theory
of
the
penalty
is
the
theory
that,
in
effect,
the
investment
will
be
siphoned
out
of
interstate
commerce
and
into
investment
in
corporations
that
do
business
solely
intrastate.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
argument
affected
by
the
fact
that,
by
and
large,
the
investment
market
is
a
national
investment
market?
i
mean,
if
the
stock
were
being
sold
entirely
in
the
state,
your
argument
would
be
a
very
strong
one.
stock
characteristically,
though,
is
sold
on
national
markets,
and
is
this
fact,
this
tendency
to
favor
intra
rather
than
interstate
investment
in
effect
going
to
be
diluted
almost
to
the
point
of
the
incidental
by
the
fact
that
we
have
a
national
market,
and
that
the
investor
in
oregon
isn't
going
to
be
worrying
about
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
we
don't
look
any
further
than
what
justice
holmes
wrote,
wouldn't
it
be
simpler
to
say
that
what
holmes
was,
and
what
the
court
was
holding
in
that
case
was
really
something
about
equal
protection
in
judging
economic
regulation,
and
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
today
is
that
that
is
not
the
standard
for
dormant
commerce
clause
taxation
and
let
it
go
at
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean,
it
really
could
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
--looked
at
as
simply
as
that,
couldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
same...
i
mean,
i...
just
perhaps
following
up
on
justice
o'connor's
question,
i
suppose
your
reasoning
here
is
going
to
be
equally
applicable
when
we're
talking
about
related
taxes
on
different
taxpayers
who
are
themselves
related
not
as
shareholder
in
corporations
but
as
debtor
and
creditor.
i
mean,
i
suppose
this
is
going
to
be
applied,
your
rule
would
be
applied
in
the
area
of
taxation
of
savings
account
interest,
and
so
on,
on
banks,
wouldn't
it?
a
bank
could
not
say,
well...
a
state
could
not
say
well,
we
will
not
tax
interest
earned
in
the
banks
of
our
state,
but
we
will
tax
interest
earned
in
the
banks
of
other
states.
the
rule
would
be
the
same.
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
issue
has
percolated
up
through
the
appellate
courts.
justice
o'connor,
if
you
are
concerned
about
the
repeal,
the
repeal
occurred
on
april
18
of
this
year,
3
days
after
the
last
due
date
for
the
filing
of
the
'95
returns,
and
therefore
the
repeal
has
not
even
taken
effect
yet.
last
week
i
called
three
attorney...
three
accountants
and
was
told
of
five
cases
of
assessment
of
this
tax
that
have
occurred
since
the
repeal,
and
therefore
this
tax
is
ongoing
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
the
court
has
not
questioned
the
compensating
tax
defense,
and
i
will
not
dwell
on
it
except
to
say
that
it
is
designed
to
prevent
a
preference
for
interstate
commerce.
it
is
designed
to
address
the
situation
where
the
normal
taxing
regime
somehow
misses
taxation
of
interstate
commerce.
well,
here,
the
normal
taxing
regime,
the
compensated
tax,
according
to
the
decision
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,
is
the
corporate
income
tax.
what
does
the
corporate
income
tax
fall
on?
it
falls
on
all
of
the
income
earned
from
business
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
this
court
has
said
many
times
that's
all
the
state
of
north
carolina
is
entitled
to
tax
the
corporation
upon,
and
therefore,
nothing
has
been
missed.
there's
nothing
left
to
be
compensated
for,
and
yet
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
decision
did
indicate
that
the
stock
tax
was
a
proxy
for
tax
on
corporate
income
earned
out
of
state.
no
doubt
realizing
the
difficulty
of
this
position,
the
state
has
developed
a
new
theory
on
its
appeal
brief
to
this
court
that
somehow
there
must
be
a
payment
for
access
to
capital
markets
by
foreign
corporations,
and
if
the
foreign
corporation
is
not
paying
a
corporate
income
tax
to
the
state,
then
its
shareholders
must
pay
a
stock
tax,
which
is
a
proxy
tax
on
the
foreign
corporation.
getting
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
we
have
no
objection
to
a
tax
on
100
percent
of
the
value
of
the
foreign
corporation's
stock,
as
long
as
it's
also
applied
to
the
value
of
the
local
corporation's
stock.
the
issue
is
not
really
so
much
the
compensating
tax
defense
as
the
need,
as
the
other
shoe
that
the
state
has
to
drop,
which
is,
oh,
by
the
way,
we
don't
just
want
to
tax
100
percent
of
the
value
of
the
stock
for
access
to
capital
markets,
we
want
to
give
this
deduction
so
that
we
don't
have
double
taxation
intrastate,
and
that
is,
i
believe,
the
real
issue
in
this
case.
and
that
brings
us,
justice
souter,
back
to
jefferson
lines,
because
i
believe
jefferson
lines
indicated
that
a
state
cannot
attempt
to
avoid
intrastate
double
taxation
and
at
the
same
time
create
interstate
double
taxation
and
ignore
taxes
paid
to
other
states.
and
justice
rehnquist,
this
also
brings
us
back
to...
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
this
also
brings
us
back
to
darnell,
because
in
darnell
mr.
justice
holmes
said,
we
need
not,
or
the
state
of
indiana
need
not
concern
itself
with
the
taxes
paid
by
the
corporation
to
other
states.
that
can
just
simply
be
irrelevant.
well,
we
know
that
the
more
modern
commerce
clause
jurisprudence
of
this
court
indicates
that
a
state
must
concern
itself
with
taxes
paid
to
other
states,
and
that
was
mentioned
in
armco
v.
hardesty,
where
the
decision
said,
this
out-of-state
manufacturer
who
is
paying
the
local
wholesaling
tax
undoubtedly
is
paying
an
out-of-state
manufacturing
tax,
or
may
be
paying
an
out-of-state
manufacturing
tax
and
therefore
it
is
subject
to
dual
taxation,
whereas
the
manufacturer
who
sells
at
home
only
pays
one
tax.
now,
there
might
be
some
question
of
whether
other
states
have
manufacturing
taxes.
frankly,
we
don't
have
one
in
the
state
of
north
carolina,
but
there's
not
much
question
that
almost
every
state
in
these
50
states
has
a
corporate
income
tax,
so
with
respect...
so
regardless
of
how
many
states
have
stock
taxes,
every
state
has
a
corporate
income
tax,
and
therefore
to
the
extent
other
states
are
collecting
corporate
income
taxes
on
multi-state
corporations,
when
their
stock
is
held
in
north
carolina
there
will
be
double
taxation,
whereas
if
the
stock
is
owned
by
the
local
corporation,
and
more
importantly
if
the
local
corporation
just
keeps
its
business
at
home,
only
one
tax
is
paid.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
very
well,
mr.
cummings.
mr.
rothfeld,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
rothfeld,
how
does
an
individual
taxpayer
in
north
carolina,
who
perhaps
owns
some
shares
or
something,
figure
out
what
he
ought
to
pay?
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
you
know
you
can't
do--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
why
does
that
not
point
to
the
problem
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
compensatory
tax
analysis
in
effect
can
supplant
the
rule
that
requires
an
apportionment
of
income.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that's
going
to
be
the
effect
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
effect
of
your
theory,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
the
intangible
stock
is
in
effect
a
surrogate
for
income,
and
therefore
the
two
may
be
considered
in
relation
to
each
other
in
determining
what
i
should
tax,
and
if,
in
fact,
there
is
this
surrogate
relationship,
and
you
are
justified
in
taxing
the
one,
you
would
be
justified,
i
suppose,
in
taxing
100
percent
of
the
income
even
though
80
percent
of
it
was
earned
out
of
the
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
taxes
are
not
equivalent,
and
there
is
no
substantial
equivalent
of
taxing
event.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
if
your
argument
is
sound,
then
we're
going
to
read
an
awful
lot
of
recent
compensatory
taxation
law
going
off--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how
can
you
rely
on
that
kind
of
an
analysis
when
in
your
earlier
breath
you
stood
here
and
told
us
that
the
state's
theory
in
effect
is
that
this
intangible
is,
in
fact,
a
surrogate,
and
for
purposes
of
commerce
clause
analysis
somehow
can
be
identified
with
the
income
of
the
corporations?
if
we
accept
that
analysis,
then
we,
i
suppose,
should
not
give
any
kind
of
special
status
to
the
taxation
of
the
intangible
here,
and
if
we
accept
that
analysis,
it
seems
to
me
that
backs
you
right
into
the
internal
inconsistency,
because
on
that
analysis,
if
all
states
enact
the
same
tax
there's
going
to
be
more
than
100
percent
of
taxation
on
the
identical
segment
of
value,
or
the
identical
event.
i
mean,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
the
form
is
going
to
govern,
then
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
a
different
problem,
and
that
is
the
problem
of
compensatory
taxation,
supposedly,
but
involving
different
classes
of
taxpayers,
and
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
unless
you
rely
on
darnell,
we
have
never
applied
the
analysis
under
those
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
i'm
overlooking
something.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
buyer
of
the
property
is...
the
class
of
buyers
is
the
only
class
that's
being
taxed.
here,
to
the
extent
that
you
cut
the
ownership
of
shares
adrift
from
the
corporation
and
its
earned
income,
you've
got
two
classes
of
taxpayer.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
substantial
equality
we've
ever
recognized
is
between
sales
and
use,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
darnell.
justice
david
h.
souter
darnell
was
a
case
that
precedes
modern
compensatory
taxation
analysis,
so
that
the
question
is,
do
we
subsume
darnell
under
the
modern
law,
that
darnell
was
not
applying
anything
like
the
modern
law,
was
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
the
issue
before
us
is
the
validity
of
what
is
called
there
an
intangibles
tax
which
is
levied
by
the
state
of
north
carolina
on
corporate
stock
owned
by
its
residents.
the
state
taxes
are
fraction
of
the
value
of
that
stock
which
is
in
inversely
proportional
to
the
extent
of
the
issuing
corporation’s
business
done
within
north
carolina.
under
this
regime,
therefore
shareholder
taxes
increase
to
the
extent
of
the
corporations
in
which
they
invest
to
do
business
outside
the
state.
the
petitioner,
fulton
corporation,
a
north
carolina
corporation
which
owns
stock
in
corporations
doing
business
out
of
state
challenged
this
tax
in
the
state
court
system.
fulton
argued
that
that
the
tax
violated
the
commerce
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
by
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce.
the
state
supreme
court
rejected
this
argument
finding
that
the
intangibles
tax
was
valid
compensatory
tax
which
work
to
equalize
the
burdens
on
inter
and
intrastate
commerce.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
and
hold
that
the
state’s
intangibles
tax
discriminates
against
interstate
commerce
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
although
we
acknowledge
that
certain
taxes
that
facially
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce,
as
this
one
does,
may
nonetheless
be
part
of
a
valid
compensating
tax
regime,
we
have
solely
replied
this
exception
in
practice
outside
the
limited
field
of
sales
and
used
taxes.
north
carolina’s
tax
meets
none
of
the
criteria
established
in
our
cases
for
a
valid
compensatory
tax
and
accordingly
it
cannot
stand.
we
therefore
remand
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
to
determine
the
appropriate
remedy
for
this
constitutional
violation.
although
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
statement,
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
