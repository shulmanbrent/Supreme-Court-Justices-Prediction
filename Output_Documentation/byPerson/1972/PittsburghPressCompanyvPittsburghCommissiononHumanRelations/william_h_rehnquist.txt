justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
volk,
sometime
in
the
last
two
or
three
weeks
i
remember
seeing
some
sort
of
a
statement
from
some
paper
that
it
was
going
to
start
publishing
want
ads
for
nothing,
without
charging
people
for
them.
and
that
led
me
to
wonder
whether
want
ads
from
the
newspaper
point
of
view
are
an
inducement
to
buy
the
paper
to
the
readers
as
well
as
a
way
of
raising
revenues
so
far
as
the
newspaper
is
concerned.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
it's
part
of
our
contention
i
would
have
it
later
in
my
argument,
that
a
newspaper
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
a
forum,
a
country
market
place
if
you
will,
a
roman
forum
of
the
flow
of
information
and
ideas,
and
a
very
significant
part
of
this
is
the
want
ad
columns.
they
are
used
by
the
department
of
labor
for
example,
as
one
of
their
indicators
of
economic
health,
the
numbers
of
lines
appearing
in
the
accumulative
want
ads
throughout
the
country.
they
are
an
interchange
of
people
who
have
the
right
to
a
job,
seeking
a
job
and
people
who
wish
to
hire
people,
trying
to
find
these
people
who
are
seeking
jobs.
it
provides
a
very
major
community
service.
now
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer
whether
the
company
makes
money
on
them
or
not,
i
suspect
it
does,
they
charge
for
want
ads
and
they
do
make
a
lot
of
their
revenue
in
their
newspaper
through
advertising
of
course.
and
i
suspect
it
is
profitable.
now
the
pittsburgh
press
has
a
massive
organization
accepting,
editing
and
setting
up
classified
want
ads,
but
it
is
and
we
are
probably
contending
that
it
is
a
major
community
service
and
we
further
contend
that's
why
we
are
here,
that
the
complainants
find
this
to
be
a
major
throat
through
which
job
applications
flow,
the
job
seekers
seeking
employers,
and
if
they
can
control,
they
discriminate
what
they
feel
to
be
a
discriminatory
aspect
of
this
at
that
throat,
then
they
can
take
a
big
step
forward
in
eliminating
discrimination
without
the
difficulty
of
proving
any
individual
active
discrimination
or
any
individual
intent
to
discriminate.
they
can
get
what
they
culturally
seek
which
is
broader
job
opportunities
or
broader
job
opportunities
for
women
something
which
we
do
not
necessarily
disagree
with
editorially,
but
we
feel
that
the
place
to
battle
is
not
in
the
want-ad
pages
of
the
newspaper
particularly
as
it
relates
to
the
judgment
of
the
newspapers
as
to
how
they
are
going
to
run
those
ads.
i
hope
that
convoluted
answer
adequately
addressed
itself
to
your
question
sir.
the
pittsburgh
press
was
after
commission
hearings
eventually
found
to
be
violative
of
the
pittsburgh
city
ordinance
in
the
way
they
place
these
ads,
they
were
found
specifically
guilty
of
section
8(j)
which
is
aiding
an
employer
in
the
act
of
discrimination.
it
is
important
to
note
that
no
--
in
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
commission,
no
act
of
discrimination
on
the
part
of
any
employer
was
found
as
a
fact.
there
was
minimal
testimony
presented
at
the
hearing
on
the
basis
of
one
potential
discriminatee
but
no
proof
was
ever
addressed
that
this
particular
job
situation
was
covered
by
the
ordinance.
the
ordinance
has
several
exceptions,
there
can
be
a
basic
occupational
qualification,
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification
exemption.
it
applies
to
only
employers
of
five
and
more
and
it
is
limited
to
the
city
of
pittsburgh
itself,
and
does
not
apply
to
domestic
help.
so
there
was
no
indication
in
the
one
bit
of
evidence
presented
that
admit
any
of
these
tests
and
the
commission
did
not
so
find
that
it
was
discriminatory.
when
we
appealed
the
case
through
common
pleas
and
through
the
commonwealth
court,
we
were
arguing
a)
no
discrimination
was
found;
and
b)
it
was
a
violation
of
the
freedom
of
the
press
to
impinge
on
its
judgment
of
the
newspapers
to
how
it
was
going
to
arrange
it's
classified
editorial
pages.
in
both
cases
we
were,
to
finally
use
colloquial
left
off,
simply
saying
that
it
is
the
law
of
the
land
that
commercial
advertising
is
not
subject
to
first
amendment
rights.
now
these,
of
course,
are
all
contained
in
the
opinions
in
the
record.
the
case
usually
cited
was
valentine
versus
chrestensen
and
we
are
here
today
to
ask
this
court
to
extend
its
concepts
of
what
constitutes
first
amendment
rights
in
a
commercial
context.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
cammarano
versus
the
united
states
in
speaking
of
valentine
versus
chrestensen,
the
ruling
was
casual
almost
offhand
and
has
not
survived
reflection.
he
also
said
the
press
in
its
historic
connotation
comprehends
every
sort
of
publication
which
affords
a
vehicle
of
information
and
opinion,
which
is
precisely
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
free
flow
of
information
here.
and
i
think
very
well
put
was
a
comment
in
an
harvard
law
review
article
on
deceptive
advertising
in
80
harvard
law
review
article
where
the
commentator
said
“yet
no
court
talking
about
valentine
versus
chrestensen,
yet
no
court
has
undertaken
to
explain
why
commercial
advertising
does
not
deserve
a
title
speech
which
enables
and
protects
social
and
religious
advocacy
and
he
went
on
to
call
it
the
stepchild
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
we
hold
that
in
the
developing
line
of
cases
in
this
court
that
the
valentine
decision
which
was
referred
to
in
the
circuit
court
in
the
hunter
case
as
being
an
unbroken
line
of
authority
for
valentine
on.
on
the
contrary
it
maybe
unbroken
but
it
is
a
hazy
and
indistinct
line
at
best
and
in
my
reading
of
the
cases
occasionally,
if
not
broken,
certainly
it
disappears
like
a
road
line
on
a
snowy
day,
and
we
feel
that
the
concepts
developing
in
this
court
as
annunciated
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan
and
in
dissents
in
breard
versus
alexandria
and
in
all
of
the
newspaper
cases
from
grosjean
on
indicate
that
the
valentine
case
was
simplistic,
that
the
words
and
phrases
of
the
circuit
court
would
set
absolute
prohibition
of
expression
in
the
marketplace
as
illegal
and
is
not
be
saved
by
any
commercial
thing,
if
that's
to
the
expression
requires
very
serious
redefinition
by
this
court
and
we
are
asking
you
to
do
so
on
a
--
justice

h.
rehnquist

isn't
that
some
judgment
left
with
the
commission
as
to
whether
or
not
it
will
give
such
an
exemption?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
strassburger,
supposing
that
your
commission
applied
the
regulations
and
ordinance
that
it
now
has
and
you
felt
that
it
just
wasn't
getting
far
enough
in
eliminating
employment
discrimination,
because
there
were
still
nuances
in
the
want-ads
that
it
just
couldn't
seem
to
eliminate,
and
supposing,
the
city
of
pittsburgh
then
decided
that
there
will
be
no
help
wanted
ads
permitted
in
the
newspapers,
we
are
going
to
funnel
them
all
through
a
public
employment
agency,
where
we
can
make
sure
that
these
nuances
are
eliminated,
now
would
you
think
that
was
constitutional?
