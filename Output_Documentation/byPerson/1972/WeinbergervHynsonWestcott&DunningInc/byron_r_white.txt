justice
byron
r.
white
almost
(inaudible)
and
also
includes
any
drug
certified
by
nda?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
there
are
lot
of
other
drugs
that
are
coming
through
nda?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
you
call
them
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
drugs
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
involved
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
put
it
on
the
label?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
just
think
of
the
lawyers?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
died?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
died?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
specific
company
--
again
a
specific
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
--
rather
a
new
drug?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
is
the
underlying
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
the
--
this
is
its
reputation
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
its
actual
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
possibly
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
another
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say,
for
the
new
drug
thing,
clinically
to
rule
making
title?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
title
hearing
required
that,
so
is
that
an
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
still
be
an
adjudicate
--
but
it
would
be
a
hearing
for
the
purpose
of
making
it
adjudication?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
one
that's
to
be
made
on
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
that
third
circuit
agreed
on
concurrent
--
said
concurrent
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
mean
to
say
whether
a
district
court
would
have
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
very
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
if
you
get
oral
argument
and
argue
with
the
commissioner
as
to
whether
or
not
the
material
submitted
(inaudible)
before
the
bureau
of
drugs.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
go
there
and
disagree
with
the
commission
that
these
materials
submitted
in
that
make
a
threshold
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
lawyer
could
go
there,
whoever
could
appear
but
could
not
put
in
the
record
an
expert's
opinion
that
this
material
did
meet
the
threshold
requirement?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
said
put
in
the
record
as
a
matter
of
evidence,
putting
him
on
the
stand
and
introduced
as
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
you
could
submit
even
though
the
commission
determines
that
there
is
no
issue
of
fact,
you
could
submit
--
have
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
have
submitted
that
ahead
of
time
and
in
writing?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
all
these
people
applying
to
that.
i
thought
they
were
actually
hearing
of
some
kind
of
some
dimension
and
what
is
it
they
want
that
you
won't
give
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
the
difference?
you
say,
you
can
--
they
can
submit
anything
they
want
to,
all
the
experts
they
want
to,
only
in
writing
though,
but
if
the
commission
then
says
you
haven't
submitted
anything
to
create
an
issue
of
fact
and
in
our
judgment,
you
haven't
met
the
threshold
requirements,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
now
what
this
hynson
want
to
be
able
to
do
in
addition
to
what
you
want
to
permit
to
them,
what
did
they
want
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
would
like,
for
example,
to
be
able
to
do
a
chat
like
lawyers
do
with
the
other
sides
witnesses.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
they
would
like
to
know
what
do
you
mean
and
what's
your
opinion
based
on,
things
like
that,
like
lawyers
do
and
like
what
do
you
do
to
have
their
interest
determined
in
an
adversary,
adjudicatory
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
you
are
saying
is
that
you
are
doing
no
more
than
to
these
people
then
where
the
courts
normally
do
to
lawyers
and
parties
everyday
in
granting
summary
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
in
some
of
the
judgments,
you
can
submit
counter
affidavits
which
you
say
you
can
do
it,
but
you
(inaudible)
arguments
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
normally
go
out
to
the
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
a
bureau,
in
argument
with
your
body
that
kind
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
there
is
the
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
argue
with,
when
you
want
to
say
well,
you
say
i
haven't
submitted
something
and
that
i
want
to
argue,
i
want
to
try
convince
you
that
i
had
or
you
say
it'd
be
given?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commissioner
construes
the
act
to
say
that
he
is
administering
in
this
way.
i
am
going
to
withdraw
ndas
unless
you
people
who
hold
them
submit
sufficient
evidence
to
me?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
provision
under
--
for
withdrawing
(inaudible)
it's
the
(e)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
pleading
under
505
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
a
that
there
is
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
such
as
drug
was
badly
affected?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
basis
of
new
information
(inaudible)
with
drug,
exaggerated
together
with
the
other
(inaudible)
lack
of
substantial
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
right
after
that,
in
most
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
how
--
what
does
the
other,
what
do
you
opponents
want
a
hearing
about
them
to
convince
somebody
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
court
think
the
hearing
would
be
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
not
they
judgments?
are
not
they
judgments
of
–
aren't
they
sort
of
ultimate
or
intermediate
judgments
of
the
underlying
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
is
it
your
understanding
of
e3
that
the
commissioner
is
authorized
to
set
a
side
in
nda
if
there
is
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness
and
safety
and
that
he
may
put
the
burden
on
you
to
submit
evidence
--
to
submit
that
substantial
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
you
say
no,
then
what's
your
understanding.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
it
be
--
let's
assume
that
the
commissioner
does
give
you
an
hearing.
he
asks
you
to
submit
evidence.
he
says,
i
think
that
it
is
a
question
about
this
drug
and
he
asks
you
to
submit
evidence
and
you
submit
none,
for
example,
may
he
then
withdraw
the
nda
without
making
any
finding
other
than
that
there
is
a
failure
to
produce
any
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
must
--
do
you
think
he
has
got
a
verdict
going
forward
with
something
like
this
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
burden
of
truth?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
suppose
they
give
you
this
notice
that
says,
please
submit
evidence
and
you
submit
evidence.
he
says,
there
is
a
question,
now,
let's
have
a
hearing
and
you
do
submit.
we
think
there
is
some
sense.
so,
we
have
a
hearing.
now,
at
that
hearing,
while
you
have
the
hearing
and
he
then
revokes
the
nda,
what
must
he
find?
does
he
find
only
that
there
is
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
means
conclusively
drug
is
ineffective?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
the
hearing,
you
would
think
that
he
carries
the
burden
of
knowing,
if
you
have
a
hearing
that
he
puts
on
evidence
first,
if
you
are
going
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
the
report
of
the
board
or
the
scientific
commission
about
lutrexin,
for
example,
he
just
says,
here
is
what
i
have,
here
is
the
report
i
have.
would
that
be
a
prima
facie
case
for
him,
as
far
as
you
are
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
government
were
relying
for
example
on
conclusions
of
some
outside
specialists,
you
would
want
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
has
substance
only
if
the
statute
puts
the
burden
going
forward
and
on
the
--
and
approve
some
kind
of
the
burden
the
administrator
rather
than
upon
you
to
convince
him
of
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
almost
(inaudible)
and
also
includes
any
drug
certified
by
nda?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
there
are

of
other
drugs
that
are
coming

so,
we
have
a
hearing.
now,
at
that
hearing,
while
you
have
the
hearing
and
he
then
revokes
the
nda,
what
must
he
find?
does
he
find
only
that
there
is
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
of
effectiveness?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
means
conclusively
drug
is
ineffective?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
the
hearing,
you
would
think
that
he
carries
the
burden
of
knowing,
if
you
have
a
hearing
that
he
puts
on
evidence
first,
if
you
are
going
to
have
an
evidentiary
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
the
report
of
the
board
or
the
scientific
commission
about
lutrexin,
for
example,
he
just
says,
here
is
what
i
have,
here
is
the
report
i
have.
would
that
be
a
prima
facie
case
for
him,
as
far
as
you
are
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
government
were
relying
for
example
on
conclusions
of
some
outside
specialists,
you
would
want
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
point
has
substance
only
if
the
statute
puts
the
burden
going
forward
and
on
the
--
and
approve
some
kind
of
the
burden
the
administrator
rather
than
upon
you
to
convince
him
of
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
