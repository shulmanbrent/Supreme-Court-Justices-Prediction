mr.
freedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
five
consolidated
cases
present
important
questions
under
the
1962
amendments
to
the
federal
food,
drug
&
cosmetic
law.
under
the
predecessor
statute,
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
granting
pre-marketing
clearance
to
new
drugs
is
limited
to
considering
the
safety
of
those
drugs,
that's
it
views,
whether
the
drug
was
safe,
and
the
major
change
made
in
the
1962
amendment,
insofar
as
these
cases
are
concerned,
is
that
this
pre-marketing
clearance
was
extended
to
cover
the
effectiveness
of
drugs
as
well
as
their
safety.
and
these
cases
present
before
the
court
the
questions
of
the
standards
under
the
statute
and
the
procedures
by
which
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
the
large
number
of
drugs
now
on
the
market,
and
thereby
to
protect
the
public
against
the
distribution
in
interstate
commerce
of
ineffective
drugs.
the
statutory
provisions
are
quite
detailed
and
complicated.
and
in
order
to
put
the
issues
in
a
proper
perspective
and
indicate
the
interrelationship
among
the
issues
in
the
cases,
before
discussing
the
particular
cases,
i
would
like
to
make
a
rather
generalized
statement
that
is
applicable
to
all
of
the
cases,
in
which
i'll
first
describe
the
background
and
history
of
the
statute,
then
deal
with
its
particular
provisions,
and
finally
explain
the
administrative
statute
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
taken
to
implement
the
statute.
after
this
opening
statement,
which
according
to
my
best
estimate
should
take
around
20
minutes,
the
cases
will
then
be
argued
in
three
separate
segments.
the
first
segment
will
consist
of
the
bentex
and
ciba
cases,
which
i
will
argue
for
the
government,
and
in
each
segment,
the
case
will
be
viewed
as
a
separate
case.
that
is,
the
opening
argument
will
be
made
by
the
government
in
the
first
two,
and
by
respondents,
petitioners'
counsel,
the
drug
company
in
the
third,
then
there
will
be
an
answering
argument,
and
this
in
turn
will
be
followed
by
rebuttal.
so
if
the
court
will
have
in
the
way
of
an
oral
presentation,
as
an
opening
statement
applicable
to
all
of
the
cases
followed
in
effect
by
three
separate
consecutive
arguments,
in
which
as
i
think
it
will
develop
the
issues
are
somewhat
interrelated.
now
the
starting
point
in
the
analysis
of
the
statute
is
the
1906
food
&
drug
act.
now
that
act
prohibited
to
the
distribution
and
interstate
commerce
of
adulterated
and
misbranded
drugs,
but
the
act
had
no
provision
for
pre-marketing
clearance
of
the
drugs
by
any
administrative
agency.
the
only
sanctions
under
that
act
were
proceeding
to
forfeit
the
misbranded
or
adulterated
drugs
and
criminal
prosecutions.
in
1938,
as
the
result
of
a
tragic
accident
in
which
a
number
of
people
died,
as
a
result
of
taking
a
drug
that
had
not
been
tested
and
proved
to
be
unsafe,
congress
passed
the
federal
food
drug
&
cosmetic
act,
which
for
the
first
time
provided
for
pre-marketing
clearance
of
drugs,
before
the
drugs
could
be
distributed
in
interstate
commerce.
the
statute
prohibited
the
introduction
of
any
new
drug,
unless
there
was
in
effect
an
application
that
had
been
filed
with
and
permitted
to
become
effective
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
these
applications
for
the
marketing
of
new
drugs
are
known
in
the
industry
as
nda’s,
new
drug
applications,
and
both
the
government
and
the
counsel
for
respondents
will
use
that
term
to
describe
them.
the
statute
also
provided
that
after
notice
and
opportunity
for
hearing,
the
secretary
could
deny
any
application
for
new
drug
approval
if
he
found
either
that
the
drug
was
not
safe
or
that
he
was
unable
to
find
that
it
was
safe,
and
finally,
it
permitted
the
suspension
of
an
approved
new
drug
application
if
subsequent
evidence
developed
to
show
that
the
drug
was
unsafe.
the
1938
statute
also
substantially
expanded
the
enforcement
authority
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
it
gave
the
administrate,
correction,
the
secretary
of
agriculture;
the
statute
in
terms
delegates
the
powers
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
that
was
transferred
to
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
but
he
has
delegated
virtually
all
of
his
powers
under
the
statute
to
the
food
and
drug
administration,
and
i
would
use
the
term
secretary
and
food
and
drug
administration
interchangeably.
it
--
the
statute
authorized
the
secretary
to
promulgate
regulations
for
the
efficient
enforcement
of
the
act,
gave
the
agency
authority
to
conduct
investigations,
and
finally
expanded
the
district
court
authority
to
include
suits
for
injunction
in
addition
to
forfeiture
in
criminal
proceedings.
now
the
processing
of
these
new
drug
applications
is
a
--
mr.
freedman
no,
no
--
mr.
freedman
no,
in
addition
to
that,
in
addition
to
that
under
the
19
--
before
the
1962
act,
the
secretary
had
authority
to
deny
approval
to
a
new
drug
application
if
he
either
found
that
the
new
drug
application,
that
the
drug
was
not
safe,
or
that
they
had
failed
to
find
it
was
safe,
and
in
addition
to
that,
he
had
the
authority
to
withdraw
approval
after
notice
and
opportunity
for
hearing,
if
subsequent
developments
after
the
nda
had
become
effective,
indicated
the
drug
was
not
safe.
then
in
addition
to
that
if
there
were
the
ancillaries,
we
believe
the
ancillary
remedies
of
proceedings
in
the
district
court
under
which
--
under
the
1938
act,
prior
to
the
1938
act,
they
could
only
proceed
under
--
through
criminal
proceedings
or
forfeiture,
but
the
1938
act
expanded
this
to
give
food
and
drug,
the
government
the
authority
to
seek
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
court.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
as
a
practical
matter
because
of
the
nature
of
drugs
and
public
concern,
it's
a
rare
instance
in
which
a
drug
manufacturer
would
attempt
to
market
a
drug,
if
the
food
and
drug
administration
concluded
that
it
could
not
permit
the
new
drug
application
to
become
effective.
in
other
words,
our
basic
position
here
is
that
the
primary
enforcement
method
that
congress
selected
in
the
1938
act,
and
increased
and
improved,
and
the
1962
act
was
the
administrative
procedure
of
pre-drug
marketing,
pre-marketing
clearance
for
drugs.
that
is,
that
the
agency
would
stand
at
the
gateway
before
the
drugs
could
get
into
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce,
and
say,
whether
or
not
they
would
permit
these
drugs
to
be
distributed.
now
--
mr.
freedman
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
freedman
yes,
i
will
come
to
that
in
one
or
two
minutes
mr.
justice.
after
just
making
this
one
point
that
the
processing
of
these
new
drug
applications
is
an
extremely
time
consuming
and
difficult
task,
they
are
huge
things;
they
are
filled
with
a
mountain
of
scientific
information.
they
may
have
statements
from
as
many
as
several
hundred
doctors
giving
their
views
on
these
drugs,
they
are
papers,
they
are
lengthy
analysis.
i
am
told
that
they
are
sometimes
occupy
as
much
as
several
hundred
volumes.
they
may
fill
half
of
a
room,
and
obviously,
it
would
have
been
an
enormous
task
for
food
and
drug
just
to
process
these
applications
as
they
were
filed,
and
i
would
mention
that
in
the
period
between
the
1938
act,
and
1962
act,
food
and
drug
processed
and
permitted
to
become
effective
almost
10,000
of
these
applications,
and
at
the
time
the
1962
act
was
passed,
it
was
estimated
there
were
approximately
4,000
of
these
applications
covering
drugs
that
were
then
being
distributed.
now
the
fact
of
life
in
the
drug
industry
is
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
drugs
on
the
market,
which
are
basically
the
same
generic
drug,
but
with
various
chemical
differences,
that
they
are
fundamentally
the
same,
but
they
have
slight
variations.
most
of
these
drugs
would
come
on
the
market
after
a
new
drug
application
had
become
effective.
what
would
happen
is
one
or
two
new
drug
applications
would
come
on
the
market,
the
drug
would
be
in
use
for
two
or
three
years,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
safe,
and
of
course,
under
the
1938
act,
safety
was
the
sole
criteria
for
passing
on
new
drug
applications.
and
following
this,
a
large
number
of
other
pharmaceutical
firms
would
put
on
the
market,
sell
their
products
for
normally
labeled,
label
goes
of
course
to
the
doctor,
we
are
not
talking
of
a
label
on
the
package
of
packed
medicine,
this
is
the
label
that
tells
the
doctor
what
the
drug
will
do,
label,
basically
making
the
same
or
very
similar
claims
to
those
in
the
drugs
whether
the
new
drug
applications
were
outstanding.
since
under
the
1938
statute,
the
test
of
a
new
drug
was
whether
the
drug
was
safe,
and
since
by
definition,
after
these
new
drug
applications
had
been
determined
to
be
safe,
the
so
called
'me-too'
drugs
which
is
what
the
industry
calls
the
drugs
that
a
pattern
after
the
nda
drugs,
but
for
which
no
nda
is
in
effect,
they
came
to
be
recognized
as
not
new
drugs
or
old
drugs,
and
they
came
on
the
market.
the
estimates
are
that
in
the
prescription
drug
field,
there
is
anywhere
from
5
to
13
'me-toos'
for
every
drug
with
respect
to
which
an
nda
is
outstanding.
so
that
by
1962
when
the
amendments
were
passed,
the
best
estimate
is
that
there
were
probably
30,000
to
50,000
drugs
outstanding
in
the
'me-too'
category,
and
that
is
just
in
the
prescription
drug
field.
in
addition
to
the
old
accounted
drug
field
has
vastly
greater
number.
it's
impossible
to
know,
but
the
best
estimate
of
food
and
drug
would
probably,
there
were
200,000
drugs
in
all
over-the-counter
market.
mr.
freedman
application,
but
it
is
also
the
--
mr.
freedman
well,
it's
used
interchangeable
--
mr.
freedman
i
am
going
to
use
it
primarily
as
new
drug
approval,
that
is
as
a
new
drug
application
that
has
been
approved,
and
the
phrase
is
sometimes
used
as
nda,
but
what
i
think
i
will
do
is,
when
i
am
speaking
of
the
application
refer
to
it
as
the
application,
and
when
i
am
speaking
it
to
the
approval,
i
will
use
the
short
phrase,
nda.
mr.
freedman
that
is
the
approved
application,
improved
application.
mr.
freedman
well,
it
may
be
identical,
it
may
actually
be
identical,
but
at
least
it's
similar.
the
--
mr.
freedman
now
mr.
justice,
it's
used
in
the
trade,
it's
used
in
the
trade
to
relate
just
to
drugs,
which
are
similar
to
the
drugs
which
are
nda.
mr.
freedman
oh
yes,
they
are.
mr.
freedman
just
--
mr.
freedman
drugs?
oh,
they
are
mostly
--
they
are
in
the
over-counter-market,
and
they
are
many,
many
hundreds
of
them
--
mr.
freedman
they
are
not
directly
involved
in
this
case,
but
some
of
the
principles
involved
in
this
case
will
be
significant,
when
food
and
drug
implements
its
recently
established
procedures
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
the
over-the-counter
drugs.
mr.
freedman
well,
common
aspirin
at
the
moment
i
assume
is
viewed
as
a
drug
that
is
both
safe
and
effective.
now
--
mr.
freedman
it
long
predates,
it's
not
a
prescription
drug,
it's
over-the-counter.
there
is
of
course
no
nda
for
common
aspirin.
now
there
are
various
compounds
of
aspirin.
there
is
bufferin,
various
types
of
analgesics.
they
are
advertised,
many
of
them
are
advertised,
perhaps
as
effective
for
various
things.
food
and
drug
may
want
to
consider,
whether
in
fact,
the
claims
made
for
aspirin
and
related
aspirin
drugs,
whether
these
claims
are
valid
in
the
sense
that
the
drug
is
effective
for
the
particular
condition
that
it
is
alleged
that
it
can
alleviate.
now,
let
me
take
you
one
step
beyond
that.
suppose
one
of
the
aspirin
companies
came
out
and
announced
that
they
discovered
that
if
took
four
tablets
of
aspirin
four
times
a
day,
it
would
cure
acne.
this
would
be
a
new
claim,
and
under
the
statute
even
though
there
is
no
nda,
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
--
to
the
–
excuse
me,
food
and
drug
could
consider
whether
the
drug
would
be
effective
for
that
particular
new
claim.
mr.
freedman
if
they
put
it
on
the
label.
now
with
the
limited
staff
that
food
and
drug
has,
it
was
obviously
impossible
for
it
to
police
this
vast
number
of
new
drug,
of
these
drugs,
and
particularly
the
'me-toos.'
occasionally
they
brought
a
proceeding
against
a
violator
which
was
a
sporadic
thing,
but
by
and
large,
in
this
period,
the
food
and
drug
administration
could
not
deal
with
the
vast
number
of
'me-toos.'
mr.
freedman
relatively
small,
at
the
time
of
the
statute
i
think
in
1962
the
budget
was
just
few
million
dollars,
it's
expanded
somewhat,
a
good
bit
now,
but
nevertheless
it
seems
the
staff
is
still
inadequate
to
handle
the
policing
job,
if
you
were
trying
to
police
this
on
a
drug-to-drug
basis.
a
hearing,
if
you
have
full
hearing
on
a
single
drug,
it
can
take
3
or
4
months,
and
when
we
point
out
that
they
are
just
thousands
of
these
drugs,
and
one
of
our
points
is,
it'd
just
be
impractical
for
a
food
and
drug
administration
to
deal
with
them
on
a
single
drug-to-drug
basis.
mr.
freedman
sir,
i
am
advised
6000
altogether,
but
this
includes
all
the
scientific
people,
the
technical
people,
the
statistical
people,
and
so
on.
that
may
seem
like
a
lowest
staff
mr.
justice,
but
it's
an
enormous
problem,
and
they
assure
me
the
staff
is
quite
inadequate
to
deal
effectively.
mr.
freedman
no,
no,
that's
the
whole
agency.
mr.
freedman
food
and
cosmetics.
mr.
freedman
yes,
--
all
of
the
premise
and
selling.
the
actual
number
of
people
working
on
the
drug
phase
of
the
--
mr.
freedman
new
drug
application.
mr.
freedman
much
smaller,
oh
yes.
mr.
freedman
unfortunately,
[attempt
to
laughter]
they
don't
have
enough
lawyers
either
mr.
justice.
now
between
1959
and
1961,
the
senate
conducted
lengthy
hearings
on
the
drug
industry,
and
one
of
the
things
that
came
out
in
these
hearings,
was
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
powerless
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
many,
many
drugs
were
ineffective
to
accomplish
the
claims
made
for
them,
and
the
problem
was
recognized
as
a
serious
one.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony,
but
food
and
drug
of
course,
at
this
time
had
no
authority
to
provide
pre
clearance
approval
for
marketing
drugs
on
the
grounds
of
ineffectiveness.
and
congress
in
1962
closed
this
regulatory
gap
by
giving
food
and
drug
for
the
first
time
the
authority
to
apply
the
pre
clearance
technique
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
drugs,
as
well
as
their
safety.
and
under
the
amended
statute
in
section
505,
the
secretary
is
required
to
disapprove
an
application
for
a
new
drug,
if
he
finds
there
is
substantial
evidence,
i
am
sorry,
if
he
finds
there
is
a
lack
of
"substantial
evidence"
that
the
that
drug
will
be
able
to
have
the
effects,
and
do
the
things
claimed
for
the
drug
on
the
label.
the
congress
also
heard
at
these
hearings
of
the
importance,
in
ascertaining
the
effectiveness
of
drugs,
that
there
be
adequate
clinical
scientific
studies,
there
was
repeated
testimony
of,
much
of
which
which
have
summarized
in
our
brief
in
the
hynson
case,
repeated
testimony
that
you
cannot
determine
how
effective
a
drug
is,
merely
because
various
doctors
state
that
they
use
it
in
their
practice
and
they
found
it
worked,
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
a
control.
mr.
freedman
the
anecdotal
testimony.
mr.
freedman
yes.
mr.
freedman
anecdotal.
the
doctor
said
he
treated
6
patients
for
this
condition
and
they
recovered,
yes.
that
–
the
congress
did
a
very
unusual
--
mr.
freedman
excuse
me.
mr.
freedman
not
normally
--
mr.
freedman
--
the
doctors
--
the
anecdotal
evidence
doesn't
bring
that.
mr.
freedman
anecdotal
as
distinguished
from
the
scientific
clinical
studies.
congress
did
a
rather
unusual
thing
in
this
statute,
because
of
the
evidence
before
it,
that
clinical
studies
were
important.
when
it
said
--
it
said
in
the
statue
that
the
secretary
should
not
approve
a
new
drug
application,
unless
he
found
by
'substantial
evidence'
it
was
effective,
it
went
on
and
defined
in
the
statue
what
it
meant
by
the
substantial
evidence.
now
substantial
evidence
under
this
statute
means
something
very
different
than
substantial
evidence
in
the
traditional
administrative
statutes.
it
defines
substantial
evidence
in
the
statute
as
constituting,
meaning,
adequate
and
well
controlled
investigations,
including
clinical
investigations
by
experts
qualified
by
scientific
training
and
experience,
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
a
drug
involved.
and
congress
also
expanded
the
definition
of
new
drug
to
cover
effectiveness,
so
that
a
new
drug
is
now
defined
as
one
not
generally
recognized
among
the
experts
qualified
by
scientific
training
and
experience,
to
evaluate
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
drugs.
two
other
things
that
the
statute
did
in
the
way
of
strengthening
the
administrative
authority
of
the
food
and
drug
authority;
first
under
the
predecessor
statute
in
1938,
a
drug
new
application
became
effective
automatically,
unless
the
secretary
affirmatively
disapproved
it.
this
was
changed
in
the
1962
act,
to
provide
that
the
application
did
not
become
effective
unless
the
secretary
affirmatively
approved
it.
the
statute
also
provided
that
after
an
interim
period
of
two
years
the
secretary
was
required,
if
on
the
basis
of
new
information
before
it,
there
was
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
that
the
drug
will
have
the
effective,
proposes
to
have,
in
that
situation
the
secretary
was
to
withdraw
approval
of
the
new
drug
application.
finally,
there
is
in
the
statute
a
"grandfather"
clause,
which
i
will
not
go
into,
because
that
will
be
discussed
in
some
of
the
succeeding
cases,
under
which
certain
drugs
that
were
being
distributed
on
the
effective
date
of
the
statute
are
exempt
from
the
effectiveness
requirements
as
could
be
expected
as
a
shortest
agreement
between
the
government
and
the
companies
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
exemption.
now
--
mr.
freedman
statute
for
october
1962,
so
that
it
meant
that
until
october
10th
1964,
food
and
drug
could
not
began
proceeding
to
withdraw
the
new
drug
approvals,
on
the
ground
that
the
drugs
would
be
ineffective.
now
the
food
and
drug
administration
recognized
immediately
that
with
4000
new
drug
applications
outstanding,
approved
applications,
ndas,
it
just
couldn't
itself
undertake
with
it's
limited
staff
to
evaluate
everyone
of
these.
so
what
it
did
was,
it
called
upon
a
group
of
eminent
scientists,
the
national
academy
sciences
and
it's
constituent
national
research
council,
for
aid
in
determining
the
validity
of
the
effectiveness
claims
of
this
large
number
of
drugs.
and
what
the
national
academy
of
sciences
did
was,
it
set
up
panels;
30
panels,
each
panel
containing
6
experts
with
respect
to
the
particular
type
of
drug
involved.
the
companies
were
requested
to
submit
all
evidence
they
had
concerning
the
effectiveness
of
their
drugs
as
claimed
to
these
panels.
the
panels
then
evaluated
each
of
these
drugs,
and
made
recommendations
to
food
and
drug
with
respect
to
their
effectiveness.
they
evaluated
the
drugs,
and
what
happened
was
as
follows.
these
panels
found
all
of
these
drugs,
these
4000
ndas
that
were
reviewed,
7%
were
ineffective.
a
considerable
number
were
described
as
effective,
and
the
balance
was
somewhere
in
between,
they
described,
and
it
was
possibly
effective,
probably
effective,
effective,
but
effective
with
respect
to
some
claims
and
not
all.
many
of
the
labels
of
course
suggested
the
drug
was
suitable
for
more
than
one
condition,
and
of
the
4000
ndas,
there
were
approximately
16,000
claims,
and
the
national
academy
of
science
panels
found
that
only
19%
of
these
alleged
claims
of
effectiveness
were
valid.
after
these
studies
were
made
the
food
and
drug
administration
had
a
large
conference
with
the
industry
in
the
january
of
1968,
and
it
announced
that
it's
policy
would
be
to
apply
the
conclusions
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
to
all
drugs,
not
only
to
the
drugs
that
were
covered
by
the
ndas,
but
also
by
the
'me-too'
drugs.
and
what
they
announced,
they
said
that
they
would
do,
is
they
would
issue
notices
and
opportunity
for
hearing,
whether
as
to
all
of
the
nda
manufacturers
whose
drugs
were
found
ineffective,
and
that
they
would
permit
the
'me-toos'
to
come
in
to
those
hearings
to
be
heard.
following
--
the
best
estimate
was
that
as
a
result
of
these
procedures,
they
would
have
to
conduct
something
like
a
thousand
hearings,
and
in
1969,
in
the
hope
of
making
this
problem
manageable,
they
issued
further
regulations
in
which
they
defined
what
would
constitute
an
adequate
and
well
controlled
study,
and
very
specifically
they
told
exactly
what
it
had
to
be,
and
they
also
said
that
if
a
manufacturer
requested
a
hearing,
they
would
not
grant
a
hearing
unless
he
produced
as
indicated
as
the
substantial
evidence
that
he
would
produce,
that
type
of
evidence,
that
is
the
well
controlled
studies.
the
validity
of
this
regulation
is
at
issue
in
another
one
of
these
cases.
and
then
finally
in
1972,
the
food
and
drug
administration
issued
another
regulation
which
more
specifically
put
the
'me-toos'
on
notice,
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
nda
for
the
so
called
the
"pioneer"
drugs
would
also
apply
to
the
'me-too'
drugs.
mr.
freedman
there
is
a
specific
general
authority
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations,
section
701
and
it's
a
very
broad
statute,
it
authorizes
them
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
necessary
for
the
effective
implementation
of
the
act.
there
is
no
specific
provision
giving
the
commissioner
authority
to
define
further,
what
constitutes
"substantial
evidence,"
but
we
believe
that
as
a
general
exercise
in
administrative
authority
this
broad
rule
making
power
does
permit
him
further
to
define
and
particularize
the
standard
of
"substantial
evidence,"
which
congress
provides.
he
is
not
changing
it,
he
is
merely
explaining
what
is
meant
by
well
conducted
clinical
studies
and
investigations.
now
we
think
that
this
legislative
history
that
i
have
given,
privatizes
and
brings
home
three
things,
which
i
just
like
to
reiterate
now,
because
i
think
they
are
critical
to
the
legal
issues
in
the
cases.
first,
by
the
1962
amendments,
congress
intended
to
take
off
the
market,
to
take
off
the
market
drugs
that
had
not
been
shown
to
be
effective.
and
congress
decided
to
do
this
primarily
by
expanding
the
authority
of
the
food
and
drug
administration,
it's
pre-marketing
clearance
authority
to
cover
effectiveness
as
well
as
safety.
it
required
that
the
definition
of
whether
a
drug
be
effective,
be
put
in
terms
of
high
probative
scientific
studies.
secondly,
as
i
think
i
have
indicated,
food
and
drug
was
faced
with
this
enormous
administrative
problem
and
it
couldn't
possibly
deal
with
the
situation
on
the
basis
of
a
drug-by-drug
procedure,
of
bringing
4000
separate
proceedings.
it
had
to
deal
with
it
on
a
more
comprehensive
basis
and
finally,
we
think
the
method
it
has
selected,
the
use
of
the
national
academy,
with
it's
panels
of
experts,
the
opportunity
given
to
the
manufacturers
to
come
in
after
the
scientific
studies
have
been
made
and
to
show
why
in
effect,
in
fact,
their
drugs
were
effective
in
accordance
with
their
claims
under
principles
of
adequate
and
well
controlled
clinical
investigations,
it
was
a
reasonable
and
fair
method
of
dealing
with
the
problem.
and
with
this
as
the
background,
i
now
would
like
to
turn
to
the
two
cases
i
am
going
to
argue,
the
bentex
case,
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
ciba
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit.
the
question
in
each
of
these
cases,
is
whether
the
food
an
drug
administration
has
jurisdiction
to
determine,
whether
a
product
is
a
new
drug
to
which
the
pre-marketing
clearance
procedures
and
the
withdrawal
procedures
of
section
505
of
the
statute
are
applicable.
our
contention
is
that
the
secretary
and
the
fda
does
have
that
authority.
the
fourth
circuit
held
and
the
respondents
contend
that
he
does
not,
and
as
they
view
his
authority,
the
only
thing
he
can
do
is
pass
upon
applications
for
new
drug
approvals
or
withdraw
previously
affective
applications.
he
cannot
according
to
their
theory
decide
the
threshold
question,
whether
or
not,
something
is
a
new
drug.
bentex
involves
a
drug
to
deal
with
the
mental
problems
of
senility.
now
bentex
is
a
'me-too'
manufacturer.
there
is
no
nda
outstanding
for
bentex
as
product,
but
prior
to
1962,
there
were
three
ndas
outstanding
for
a
similar
product.
upon
its
review
of
these
drugs,
the
national
science
foundation
panel
concluded
that
these
drugs
were
in
affective
for
their
stated
purposes.
after
evaluating
the
academy
studies,
food
and
drug
concluded
preliminary
that
there
was
not
'substantial
evidence'
of
effectiveness,
and
put
out
a
notice
of
hearing,
so
stating
and
giving
the
manufacturers
of
these
three
drugs
the
opportunity
to
request
a
hearing,
to
show
why
the
drug
was
effective,
and
it
also
invited
any
interested
persons
who
might
be
adversely
affected
by
the
removal
of
these
drugs
from
the
market
to
participate
it.
and
finally
the
notices
stated
that
withdrawal
of
ndas
for
these
three
drugs
will
cause
any
such
drug
on
the
market
to
be
a
new
drug
for
which
an
approved
new
drug
application
is
not
in
effect,
and
will
make
it
subject
to
regulatory
action.
one
of
the
three
nda
holders
submitted
some
material
which
food
and
drug
found
was
not
the
substantial
evidence
as
defined
by
the
statute.
and
after
a
second
notice
published
in
the
federal
register,
which
again
gave
interested
parties
the
opportunity
to
come
in,
and
which
again
pointed
out
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
nda
would
cause
the
'me-toos'
to
be
new
drugs.
food
and
drug
administration
withdrew
its
approval
of
the
three
ndas
covering
this
drug.
no
court
review
was
sought
of
that
action
by
the
three
nda
manufacturers.
now
under
food
and
drug's
view
of
law,
the
withdrawal
of
the
nda
also
had
the
affect
of
making
the
'me-toos'
into
new
drugs,
subject
to
the
pre-marketing
clearance,
and
accordingly
food
and
drug
sent
out
letters
to
a
number
of
manufacturers
of
the
'me-too'
drugs
pointing
this
at
to
them,
and
it
specifically
sent
such
a
letter
to
bentex
as
reprinted
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
asking
bentex
what
its
intentions
were
with
respect
to
removing
this
drug
from
the
market?
mr.
freedman
well,
we
don't
know
--
mr.
freedman
we
don't
know
--
we
are
not
sure
that
these
are
all
'me-too'
drugs.
we
do
know
that
22
of
these
people
brought
this
lawsuit.
they
sent
out
to
those
that
they
knew
about
it.
i
think
they
are
informed
people,
they
have
some
knowledge.
they
may
not
have
gotten
all
for
me.
mr.
freedman
there
is
no
real
way,
except
for
the
drug
registration
statute,
and
that
will
no
be
effective
till
to
june
of
this
year.
mr.
freedman
that's
right.
they
did
had
no
way,
but
they
did
know,
they
did
know
at
least
that
bentex
and
some
of
others
were
manufacturing
this
drug.
now
the
response
of
bentex
to
this
request
for
information
as
to
what
it
was
going
to
do
remove
the
drug
from
the
market,
was
to
bring
to
a
lawsuit
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
in
which
bentex
is
joined
by
22
other
'me-too'
manufactures.
they
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
that
their
products
were
not
new
drugs,
and
were
not
subject
to
the
application
procedures
of
section
505.
the
government
--
the
district
court
moved
to
dismiss
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
determine
this
question,
that
this
was
a
--
we
made
two
arguments.
one,
that
this
was
a
matter
within
the
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
to
food
and
drug
and
secondly,
that
since
bentex
had
had
the
opportunity
to
come
into
the
proceedings
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
ndas,
bentex
was
barred
from
litigating
this
question
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
rejected
those
arguments,
and
held
that
it
and
food
and
drug
had
concurrent
jurisdiction,
but
it
also
rejected
the
plaintiffs'
contention
in
that
lawsuit
that
the
district
court
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
question
of
new
drug
status.
and
what
it
said
was,
that
the
authority
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
approve,
or
withhold
approval
of
the
ndas,
necessarily
implies
authority
for
food
and
drug
to
determine
the
threshold
question
of
whether
the
article
involved
is
a
drug
which
requires
an
approved
new
drug
application
for
lawful
interstate
shipment?
and
the
court
then
said,
that
it
thought
it
was
appropriate
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
should
decide
this
question
in
the
first
instance,
because
it
said,
the
nature
of
the
proof
relevant
to
that
issue
makes
food
and
drug
the
more
able
arbitrator
of
the
question.
so
the
evaluation
of
conflicting
reports
in
the
field
is
not
a
matter
well
left
to
a
court
without
chemical
or
medical
background.
and
accordingly,
the
district
court
deferred
any
proceedings
in
the
case,
until
food
and
drug
had
an
opportunity
to
conduct
a
hearing
on
the
new
drug
issue.
the
government
did
not
appeal
that
aspect
of
the
case,
and
has
accepted
the
remand.
though
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
to
the
court
that
while
we
do,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
in
this
case,
plan
to
hold
a
hearing,
we
do
not
contemplate
that
the
hearing
will
be
of
the
typical
evidentiary
trial
type
hearing.
we
think
it
will
be
appropriate
to
conduct
a
hearing
along
the
rule
making
lines
which
the
agency
is
now
using
in
this
case.
mr.
freedman
yes.
mr.
freedman
well,
there
are
--
mr.
freedman
well
--
mr.
freedman
well,
that's
a
matter
of
disagreement.
again,
it's
the
statutory
definition
of
new
drug,
one
which
is
generally
recognized
among
this
group
of
experts
as
being
effective
for
it
uses.
and
that
we
think
as
mr.
frey
will
develop,we
think
that
the
general
recognition
standard
in
the
statute
is
something
in
addition
to
the
'substantial
evidence.'
that
is,
we
think
that
if
a
panel
of
experts
concludes
that
there's
not
substantial
evidence
based
on
well
conducted
clinical
studies
to
show
that
the
drug
is
effective,
the
same
experts
could
not
--
mr.
freedman
--
possibly
be
recognize
its
general
effectiveness.
we
think
the
recognition
is
something
else,
that's
the
issue.
and
for
example,
there
maybe
questions
in
these
cases,
they
claim
that
they
are
not
a
new
drug,
because
the
'me-too,'
the
nda
drugs
contain
an
additional
element
that
their
drug
doesn't
contain.
they
say
one
of
the
drugs
was
administered
intravenously,
another
is
orally
and
that's
the
distinction.
so
there
are
two
questions
really;
one
--
mr.
freedman
that
is
another
claim,
that
is
a
claim.
they
also
claimed
that
it
is
covered
by
the
'grandfather'
exemption.
mr.
freedman
that's
another
problem.
mr.
freedman
not
a
rule
making
title.
what
i
am
suggesting
mr.
justice
is,
we
do
not
contemplate
that
there
would
be
a
hearing
in
the
sense
of
a
trial
type
hearing
at
which
large
number
of
doctors
will
take
the
stand
and
give
their
opinion.
they
will
have
full
opportunity
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
commissioner
all
pertinent
material
bearing
on
their
claim,
that
their
drug
is
not
a
new
drug,
because
it
is
effective
or
because
it's
covered
by
the
'grandfather'
exemption.
mr.
freedman
i
think
that
is
an
issue,
because
of
the
fact
that
in
one
of
the
other
cases
a
hearing
was
denied,
because
of
the
failure
of
the
parties
to
produce
the
kind
of
evidence
requisite.
mr.
freedman
to
these
drugs;
i
use
the
word
rule
making
perhaps
too
loosely.
what
i
would
suggest
it
would
be
a
hearing
appropriate,
concerning
all
the
circumstances
for
determining
this
question
which
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
kind
of
a
hearing
to
decide
for
an
instance
whether
an
employer
fired
a
man
for
his
union
activities
or
for
inefficiency.
mr.
freedman
yes,
it
would
be
a
hearing
to
determine
--
mr.
freedman
on
the
record,
and
we
say,
and
would
be
traditionally
revealable.
mr.
freedman
well,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
statute
has
to
--
mr.
freedman
whether
it
would
be
to
establish
a
definition,
a
determination
as
to
whether
this
type
of
drug,
whether
this
type
of
drug
is
effective
and
there
would
be
i
suppose
two
issues.
one
would
be
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
these
people’s
drugs
are
--
they
would
have
the
opportunity
under
this
particular
hearing
procedure
to
come
in
and
produce
any
additional
evidence
not
before,
for
example,
the
national
academy
proceedings,
why
their
drug
is
effective?
that
is
if
they
had
well
established
studies
that
had
not
been
presented,
they
could
present
those
to
the
commissioner.
in
addition,
they
could
come
in
and
explain
why
they
think
their
drug
is
different
from
the
fda
drug,
so
that
their
drug,
whatever
one
might
say
as
to
the
nda
drug,
as
to
why
the
'me-too'
drugs
are
not
new
drugs?
why
their
drugs
are
effective
even
though
the
'me-too'
drugs
have
been
--
although
the
fda
drugs
have
been
determined
not
to
be
effective.
if
i
may
just
--
mr.
freedman
that's
a
word
of
art,
mr.
justice.
mr.
freedman
if
it
makes
it
effective
under
the
standards,
if
it
makes
it
effective
under
this
standards,
then
it
would
not
be
a
new
drug.
in
other
words,
if
it
was
effective,
if
it's
effective,
then
it
does
not
have
to
meet
with
the
--
mr.
freedman
that's
under
the
theory,
because
he
had
the
opportunity
to
come
in.
now
we
are
not
arguing
that
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
are
not
arguing,
but
it's
--
mr.
freedman
pardon?
mr.
freedman
no,
it's
not
in
one
of
them.
what
is
is
the
question
is,
whether
the
kind
of
evidence
they
have
to
produce,
they
have
to
produce
that.
mr.
freedman
yes.
but
we
are
not
contending
in
this
case,
we
are
not
contending
in
this
case,
that
they
are
barred.
that's
what
we
argued
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
rejected,
that
was
in
the
field,
although
for
the
future
we
are
going
to
take
position,
if
they
had
the
opportunity
to
come
in
and
produce
all
the
evidence
in
the
proceeding,
and
if
they
don't
do
it,
they
are
barred.
now
the
court
of
appeal
just
briefly
held
in
this
case
that
the
--
mr.
freedman
--
fourth
circuit
in
the
bentex
case
held
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
new
drug
applications.
it
said
basically
that
the
statute
has
two
different
procedures.
food
and
drug
can
do
nothing,
but
pass
on
applications
for
approval
and
withdraw
approved
applications
if
it
finds
that
they
are
not,
the
drug
isn't
effective,
but
it
cannot
do
anything
in
the
way
of
trying
to
determine
the
threshold
question
of
whether
something
is
a
new
drug.
that
they
said
is
a
question
solely
for
the
district
court
to
be
decided
either
in
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
brought
by
the
manufacturers
or
to
be
decided
by
the
district
court
when
the
government
moves
against
the
drug.
now,
and
i
will
just
briefly
turn
to
the
facts
in
the
ciba
case,
which
presents
the
same
issue
though
in
a
different
context.
ciba
did
have
an
nda,
and
its
drug
was
reveiwed
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences,
the
claims
were
found
ineffective.
they
went
through
a
whole
series
of
procedures,
notices
were
given.
the
climax
of
this
was
that
food
and
drug
withdrew
the
nda
for
ciba’s
drug.
ciba
took
that
question
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
at
this
point
--
in
the
interval,
ciba
then
filed
a
district
court
suit
in
new
jersey,
in
which
ciba
claimed
that
it
was
not
a
new
drug,
and
that
it
was
exempt,
and
it
wanted
to
have
that
issue
determined.
the
district
court
dismissed,
the
third
circuit
affirmed,
basically
following
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
in
the
bentex
case
saying
that
when
food
and
drug
undertook
to
withdraw
the
new
drug
application,
that
it
necessarily
had
--
must
have
decided
the
threshold
question
of
whether
it
was
a
new
drug,
that
ciba
challenged
the
order
of
food
and
drug
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
that
decision,
it
will
also
upheld
the
determination
that
this
was
a
new
drug.
now,
the
problem
in
this
case
and
the
reason
we
think
that
the
third
circuit
is
correct
and
the
fourth
circuit
is
in
error
is
that
--
mr.
freedman
no,
the
third
circuit
said
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
had
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
new
drug
question
that
it
had
necessarily
decided
it
when
it
withdrew
the
application
that,
that
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
and
there
was
no
occasion
for
ciba
to
be
permitted
to
re-litigate
the
new
drug
question
in
an
independent
suit
brought
--
mr.
freedman
no,
it
did
not
-
-
all
that
it
held
was
that
food
and
drug
did
have
jurisdiction
and
that
of
course
is
the
only
issue
directly
involved
in
these
cases
whether
the
food
and
drug
has
jurisdiction.
now
the
problem
we
have
with
the
decisions
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case,
and
the
contentions
of
the
respondent
is
that
it
would
basically
transfer
to
the
district
courts,
to
the
district
courts
the
primary
enforcement
responsibility,
that
is,
it
would
bar
food
and
drug
from
making
these
threshold
determinations,
even
though
congress
in
the
1962
statute
made
it's
intention
quite
clear
that
it
intended
to
strengthen
the
hand
of
food
and
drug
in
withdrawing
from
the
market
the
drugs
posed,
stated
to
be
ineffective.
mr.
freedman
oh
yes,
that
will,
under
that
theory
it
would
be
a
de
novo
proceeding.
mr.
freedman
it
can
initiate
in
that
matter
mr.
justice,
but
it
cannot
deal
with
the
vast
bulk
of
these
applications,
because
prosecution
is
not
really
--
in
this
field
is
not
an
effective
method.
it's
not
an
effective
method
for
getting
off
the
market
these
thousands
of
drugs
which
seemingly
on
the
basis
of
the
national
academy
of
science
and
studies
are
ineffective.
that
is
to
the
whole
purpose,
the
whole
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
give
food
and
drug
administrative
authority,
to
do
the
job
that
it
had
not
been
able
to
do
under
the
1938
act.
and
the
issues
for
example
in
defining
the
new
drug
as
distinguished
from
determining
whether
there
was
'substantial
evidence'
of
effectiveness.
there
is
a
disagreement
between
the
parties
as
to
exactly
what
the
standards.
but
however
one
defines
the
standard,
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
kind
of
question,
it's
a
kind
of
question
that
calls
for
expert
skills
and
knowledge.
these
are
analysis
of
detailed
scientific
information
from
ecological
studies.
it's
the
kind
of
thing,
it's
the
kind
of
thing,
the
kind
of
expert
issue
that
traditionally
is
for
the
administrative
agencies.
and
we
think
the
district
court
in
the
bentex
case
was
well
warranted
in
sending
this
matter
to
food
and
drug.
it's
traditional
that
administrative
agencies
have
authority
to
determine
their
own
jurisdiction,
that's
the
threshold
question.
when
a
claim
is
made
that
somebody,
to
an
agency,
that
someone
is
doing
something
in
violation
of
a
statute
the
agency
administers,
the
first
question
the
agency
has
to
decide,
is
whether
or
not
the
thing
is
covered
by
the
statute?
before
you
decide
whether
there
is
a
violation,
you
decide
it
whether
the
statute
is
covered.
and
before
you
can
decide
whether
or
not
a
new
drug
application
is
required,
you'll
have
to
find
out
whether
it's
a
new
drug,
and
it
seems
to
us
rather
incongruous
to
suggest
that
congress
which
attempted
to
strengthen
fda's
authority
in
the
1962
amendments,
intended
to
deny
to
fda
this
kind
of
authority
to
determine
it's
own
jurisdiction
that
agencies
traditionally
have.
mr.
freedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
like
to
say
two
things
briefly
in
rebuttal.
first
in
response
to
a
colloquially
that
justice
stewart
had
with
mr.
szuch.
the
fda
on
many
occasions
has
sent
back
applications
that
had
been
filed
for
new
drugs
on
the
ground
that
nobody
--
that
it
was
not
needed,
i.e.
that
it
wasn't
a
new
drug.
secondly
i
just
want
to
stress
--
it
seems
to
us
that
the
anomaly
of
the
respondent's
position
here
is
well
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
the
ciba
case
itself.
the
reason
food
and
drug
initiated
a
withdrawal
proceeding
in
the
ciba
case
was
because
it
had
reason
to
believe
that
ciba's
drug
was
ineffective
and
it
wanted
to
stop
ciba
from
marketing
that.
it
held
a
full
proceeding.
it
concluded
that
ciba's
drug
was
ineffective.
it
withdrew
the
nda
and
that
action
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now
under
this
theory
that
food
and
drug
is
no
authority
to
determine
the
new
drug
status,
this
whole
proceeding
was
amounted
to
basically
annuity
because
ciba
now
claims
it
can
turn
around
and
re-litigate
under
the
new
drug
standard
in
the
district
court,
the
question
whether
or
not
it's
able
to
market
it
at
all.
mr.
freedman
it
could
be
prosecuted
mr.
justice
but
again
i
come
back
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
freedman
there
could
be,
there
could
be
a
seizure.
but
i
come
back
to
the
fact
once
again
that
is
just
not
a
practical
method
of
dealing
with
this
large
number
of
drugs
that
we
have.
you
just
cannot
accomplish
the
congressional
purpose
of
getting
these
ineffective
drugs
off
the
market,
but
the
only
thing
that
food
and
drug
can
do
is
that
when
it
finds
one
that
it
thinks
is
ineffective
is
to
bring
the
suit
in
the
district
court
to
enjoin
them
to
seize
the
drug
or
to
prosecute
them
criminally.
mr.
freedman
it
depends
on
the
type
of
action.
if
it's
the
action
in
either
denying
a
new
drug
application
or
withdrawing
the
effective
nda
that
would
be
under
section
505
(a)
that
permits
court
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
the
route
of
course,
ciba
followed.
if
it's
in
a
determination
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
made
declaratory
judgment
that
would
be
reviewable
we
think
in
the
district
court
under
the
administrative
procedure.
mr.
frey
will
now
continue
the
argument.
mr.
freedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
five
consolidated
cases
present
important
questions
under
the
1962
amendments
to
the
federal
food,
drug
&
cosmetic
law.
under
the
predecessor
statute,
the
food
and
drug
administration
in
granting
pre-marketing
clearance
to
new
drugs
is
limited
to
considering
the
safety
of
those
drugs,
that's
it
views,
whether
the
drug
was
safe,
and
the
major
change
made
in
the
1962
amendment,
insofar
as
these
cases
are
concerned,
is
that
this
pre-marketing
clearance
was
extended
to
cover
the
effectiveness
of
drugs
as
well
as
their
safety.
and
these
cases
present
before
the
court
the
questions
of
the
standards
under
the
statute
and
the
procedures
by
which
the
food
and
drug
administration
is
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
the
large
number
of
drugs
now
on
the
market,
and
thereby
to
protect
the
public
against
the
distribution
in
interstate
commerce
of
ineffective
drugs.
the
statutory
provisions
are
quite
detailed
and
complicated.
and
in
order
to
put
the
issues
in
a
proper
perspective
and
indicate
the
interrelationship
among
the
issues
in
the
cases,
before
discussing
the
particular
cases,
i
would
like
to
make
a
rather
generalized
statement
that
is
applicable
to
all
of
the
cases,
in
which
i'll
first
describe
the
background
and
history
of
the
statute,
then
deal
with
its
particular
provisions,
and
finally
explain
the
administrative
statute
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
taken
to
implement
the
statute.
after
this
opening
statement,
which
according
to
my
best
estimate
should
take
around
20
minutes,
the
cases
will
then
be
argued
in
three
separate
segments.
the
first
segment
will
consist
of
the
bentex
and
ciba
cases,
which
i
will
argue
for
the
government,
and
in
each
segment,
the
case
will
be
viewed
as
a
separate
case.
that
is,
the
opening
argument
will
be
made
by
the
government
in
the
first
two,
and
by
respondents,
petitioners'
counsel,
the
drug
company
in
the
third,
then
there
will
be
an
answering
argument,
and
this
in
turn
will
be
followed
by
rebuttal.
so
if
the
court
will
have
in
the
way
of
an
oral
presentation,
as
an
opening
statement
applicable
to
all
of
the
cases
followed
in
effect
by
three
separate
consecutive
arguments,
in
which
as
i
think
it
will
develop
the
issues
are
somewhat
interrelated.
now
the
starting
point
in
the
analysis
of
the
statute
is
the
1906
food
&
drug
act.
now
that
act
prohibited
to
the
distribution
and
interstate
commerce
of
adulterated
and
misbranded
drugs,
but
the
act
had
no
provision
for
pre-marketing
clearance
of
the
drugs
by
any
administrative
agency.
the
only
sanctions
under
that
act
were
proceeding
to
forfeit
the
misbranded
or
adulterated
drugs
and
criminal
prosecutions.
in
1938,
as
the
result
of
a
tragic
accident
in
which
a
number
of
people
died,
as
a
result
of
taking
a
drug
that
had
not
been
tested
and
proved
to
be
unsafe,
congress
passed
the
federal
food
drug
&
cosmetic
act,
which
for
the
first
time
provided
for
pre-marketing
clearance
of
drugs,
before
the
drugs
could
be
distributed
in
interstate
commerce.
the
statute
prohibited
the
introduction
of
any
new
drug,
unless
there
was
in
effect
an
application
that
had
been
filed
with
and
permitted
to
become
effective
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
these
applications
for
the
marketing
of
new
drugs
are
known
in
the
industry
as
nda’s,
new
drug
applications,
and
both
the
government
and
the
counsel
for
respondents
will
use
that
term
to
describe
them.
the
statute
also
provided
that
after
notice
and
opportunity
for
hearing,
the
secretary
could
deny
any
application
for
new
drug
approval
if
he
found
either
that
the
drug
was
not
safe
or
that
he
was
unable
to
find
that
it
was
safe,
and
finally,
it
permitted
the
suspension
of
an
approved
new
drug
application
if
subsequent
evidence
developed
to
show
that
the
drug
was
unsafe.
the
1938
statute
also
substantially
expanded
the
enforcement
authority
of
the
food
and
drug
administration.
it
gave
the
administrate,
correction,
the
secretary
of
agriculture;
the
statute
in
terms
delegates
the
powers
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
that
was
transferred
to
the
secretary
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
but
he
has
delegated
virtually
all
of
his
powers
under
the
statute
to
the
food
and
drug
administration,
and
i
would
use
the
term
secretary
and
food
and
drug
administration
interchangeably.
it
--
the
statute
authorized
the
secretary
to
promulgate
regulations
for
the
efficient
enforcement
of
the
act,
gave
the
agency
authority
to
conduct
investigations,
and
finally
expanded
the
district
court
authority
to
include
suits
for
injunction
in
addition
to
forfeiture
in
criminal
proceedings.
now
the
processing
of
these
new
drug
applications
is
a
--
mr.
freedman
no,
no
--
mr.
freedman
no,
in
addition
to
that,
in
addition
to
that
under
the
19
--
before
the
1962
act,
the
secretary
had
authority
to
deny
approval
to
a
new
drug
application
if
he
either
found
that
the
new
drug
application,
that
the
drug
was
not
safe,
or
that
they
had
failed
to
find
it
was
safe,
and
in
addition
to
that,
he
had
the
authority
to
withdraw
approval
after
notice
and
opportunity
for
hearing,
if
subsequent
developments
after
the
nda
had
become
effective,
indicated
the
drug
was
not
safe.
then
in
addition
to
that
if
there
were
the
ancillaries,
we
believe
the
ancillary
remedies
of
proceedings
in
the
district
court
under
which
--
under
the
1938
act,
prior
to
the
1938
act,
they
could
only
proceed
under
--
through
criminal
proceedings
or
forfeiture,
but
the
1938
act
expanded
this
to
give
food
and
drug,
the
government
the
authority
to
seek
injunctive
relief
in
the
district
court.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
as
a
practical
matter
because
of
the
nature
of
drugs
and
public
concern,
it's
a
rare
instance
in
which
a
drug
manufacturer
would
attempt
to
market
a
drug,
if
the
food
and
drug
administration
concluded
that
it
could
not
permit
the
new
drug
application
to
become
effective.
in
other
words,
our
basic
position
here
is
that
the
primary
enforcement
method
that
congress
selected
in
the
1938
act,
and
increased
and
improved,
and
the
1962
act
was
the
administrative
procedure
of
pre-drug
marketing,
pre-marketing
clearance
for
drugs.
that
is,
that
the
agency
would
stand
at
the
gateway
before
the
drugs
could
get
into
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce,
and
say,
whether
or
not
they
would
permit
these
drugs
to
be
distributed.
now
--
mr.
freedman
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
freedman
yes,
i
will
come
to
that
in
one
or
two
minutes
mr.
justice.
after
just
making
this
one
point
that
the
processing
of
these
new
drug
applications
is
an
extremely
time
consuming
and
difficult
task,
they
are
huge
things;
they
are
filled
with
a
mountain
of
scientific
information.
they
may
have
statements
from
as
many
as
several
hundred
doctors
giving
their
views
on
these
drugs,
they
are
papers,
they
are
lengthy
analysis.
i
am
told
that
they
are
sometimes
occupy
as
much
as
several
hundred
volumes.
they
may
fill
half
of
a
room,
and
obviously,
it
would
have
been
an
enormous
task
for
food
and
drug
just
to
process
these
applications
as
they
were
filed,
and
i
would
mention
that
in
the
period
between
the
1938
act,
and
1962
act,
food
and
drug
processed
and
permitted
to
become
effective
almost
10,000
of
these
applications,
and
at
the
time
the
1962
act
was
passed,
it
was
estimated
there
were
approximately
4,000
of
these
applications
covering
drugs
that
were
then
being
distributed.
now
the
fact
of
life
in
the
drug
industry
is
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
drugs
on
the
market,
which
are
basically
the
same
generic
drug,
but
with
various
chemical
differences,
that
they
are
fundamentally
the
same,
but
they
have
slight
variations.
most
of
these
drugs
would
come
on
the
market
after
a
new
drug
application
had
become
effective.
what
would
happen
is
one
or
two
new
drug
applications
would
come
on
the
market,
the
drug
would
be
in
use
for
two
or
three
years,
and
it
turned
out
to
be
safe,
and
of
course,
under
the
1938
act,
safety
was
the
sole
criteria
for
passing
on
new
drug
applications.
and
following
this,
a
large
number
of
other
pharmaceutical
firms
would
put
on
the
market,
sell
their
products
for
normally
labeled,
label
goes
of
course
to
the
doctor,
we
are
not
talking
of
a
label
on
the
package
of
packed
medicine,
this
is
the
label
that
tells
the
doctor
what
the
drug
will
do,
label,
basically
making
the
same
or
very
similar
claims
to
those
in
the
drugs
whether
the
new
drug
applications
were
outstanding.
since
under
the
1938
statute,
the
test
of
a
new
drug
was
whether
the
drug
was
safe,
and
since
by
definition,
after
these
new
drug
applications
had
been
determined
to
be
safe,
the
so
called
'me-too'
drugs
which
is
what
the
industry
calls
the
drugs
that
a
pattern
after
the
nda
drugs,
but
for
which
no
nda
is
in
effect,
they
came
to
be
recognized
as
not
new
drugs
or
old
drugs,
and
they
came
on
the
market.
the
estimates
are
that
in
the
prescription
drug
field,
there
is
anywhere
from
5
to
13
'me-toos'
for
every
drug
with
respect
to
which
an
nda
is
outstanding.
so
that
by
1962
when
the
amendments
were
passed,
the
best
estimate
is
that
there
were
probably
30,000
to
50,000
drugs
outstanding
in
the
'me-too'
category,
and
that
is
just
in
the
prescription
drug
field.
in
addition
to
the
old
accounted
drug
field
has
vastly
greater
number.
it's
impossible
to
know,
but
the
best
estimate
of
food
and
drug
would
probably,
there
were
200,000
drugs
in
all
over-the-counter
market.
mr.
freedman
application,
but
it
is
also
the
--
mr.
freedman
well,
it's
used
interchangeable
--
mr.
freedman
i
am
going
to
use
it
primarily
as
new
drug
approval,
that
is
as
a
new
drug
application
that
has
been
approved,
and
the
phrase
is
sometimes
used
as
nda,
but
what
i
think
i
will
do
is,
when
i
am
speaking
of
the
application
refer
to
it
as
the
application,
and
when
i
am
speaking
it
to
the
approval,
i
will
use
the
short
phrase,
nda.
mr.
freedman
that
is
the
approved
application,
improved
application.
mr.
freedman
well,
it
may
be
identical,
it
may
actually
be
identical,
but
at
least
it's
similar.
the
--
mr.
freedman
now
mr.
justice,
it's
used
in
the
trade,
it's
used
in
the
trade
to
relate
just
to
drugs,
which
are
similar
to
the
drugs
which
are
nda.
mr.
freedman
oh
yes,
they
are.
mr.
freedman
just
--
mr.
freedman
drugs?
oh,
they
are
mostly
--
they
are
in
the
over-counter-market,
and
they
are
many,
many
hundreds
of
them
--
mr.
freedman
they
are
not
directly
involved
in
this
case,
but
some
of
the
principles
involved
in
this
case
will
be
significant,
when
food
and
drug
implements
its
recently
established
procedures
to
determine
the
effectiveness
of
the
over-the-counter
drugs.
mr.
freedman
well,
common
aspirin
at
the
moment
i
assume
is
viewed
as
a
drug
that
is
both
safe
and
effective.
now
--
mr.
freedman
it
long
predates,
it's
not
a
prescription
drug,
it's
over-the-counter.
there
is
of
course
no
nda
for
common
aspirin.
now
there
are
various
compounds
of
aspirin.
there
is
bufferin,
various
types
of
analgesics.
they
are
advertised,
many
of
them
are
advertised,
perhaps
as
effective
for
various
things.
food
and
drug
may
want
to
consider,
whether
in
fact,
the
claims
made
for
aspirin
and
related
aspirin
drugs,
whether
these
claims
are
valid
in
the
sense
that
the
drug
is
effective
for
the
particular
condition
that
it
is
alleged
that
it
can
alleviate.
now,
let
me
take
you
one
step
beyond
that.
suppose
one
of
the
aspirin
companies
came
out
and
announced
that
they
discovered
that
if
took
four
tablets
of
aspirin
four
times
a
day,
it
would
cure
acne.
this
would
be
a
new
claim,
and
under
the
statute
even
though
there
is
no
nda,
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
--
to
the
–
excuse
me,
food
and
drug
could
consider
whether
the
drug
would
be
effective
for
that
particular
new
claim.
mr.
freedman
if
they
put
it
on
the
label.
now
with
the
limited
staff
that
food
and
drug
has,
it
was
obviously
impossible
for
it
to
police
this
vast
number
of
new
drug,
of
these
drugs,
and
particularly
the
'me-toos.'
occasionally
they
brought
a
proceeding
against
a
violator
which
was
a
sporadic
thing,
but
by
and
large,
in
this
period,
the
food
and
drug
administration
could
not
deal
with
the
vast
number
of
'me-toos.'
mr.
freedman
relatively
small,
at
the
time
of
the
statute
i
think
in
1962
the
budget
was
just
few
million
dollars,
it's
expanded
somewhat,
a
good
bit
now,
but
nevertheless
it
seems
the
staff
is
still
inadequate
to
handle
the
policing
job,
if
you
were
trying
to
police
this
on
a
drug-to-drug
basis.
a
hearing,
if
you
have
full
hearing
on
a
single
drug,
it
can
take
3
or
4
months,
and
when
we
point
out
that
they
are
just
thousands
of
these
drugs,
and
one
of
our
points
is,
it'd
just
be
impractical
for
a
food
and
drug
administration
to
deal
with
them
on
a
single
drug-to-drug
basis.
mr.
freedman
sir,
i
am
advised
6000
altogether,
but
this
includes
all
the
scientific
people,
the
technical
people,
the
statistical
people,
and
so
on.
that
may
seem
like
a
lowest
staff
mr.
justice,
but
it's
an
enormous
problem,
and
they
assure
me
the
staff
is
quite
inadequate
to
deal
effectively.
mr.
freedman
no,
no,
that's
the
whole
agency.
mr.
freedman
food
and
cosmetics.
mr.
freedman
yes,
--
all
of
the
premise
and
selling.
the
actual
number
of
people
working
on
the
drug
phase
of
the
--
mr.
freedman
new
drug
application.
mr.
freedman
much
smaller,
oh
yes.
mr.
freedman
unfortunately,
[attempt
to
laughter]
they
don't
have
enough
lawyers
either
mr.
justice.
now
between
1959
and
1961,
the
senate
conducted
lengthy
hearings
on
the
drug
industry,
and
one
of
the
things
that
came
out
in
these
hearings,
was
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
was
powerless
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
many,
many
drugs
were
ineffective
to
accomplish
the
claims
made
for
them,
and
the
problem
was
recognized
as
a
serious
one.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony,
but
food
and
drug
of
course,
at
this
time
had
no
authority
to
provide
pre
clearance
approval
for
marketing
drugs
on
the
grounds
of
ineffectiveness.
and
congress
in
1962
closed
this
regulatory
gap
by
giving
food
and
drug
for
the
first
time
the
authority
to
apply
the
pre
clearance
technique
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
drugs,
as
well
as
their
safety.
and
under
the
amended
statute
in
section
505,
the
secretary
is
required
to
disapprove
an
application
for
a
new
drug,
if
he
finds
there
is
substantial
evidence,
i
am
sorry,
if
he
finds
there
is
a
lack
of
"substantial
evidence"
that
the
that
drug
will
be
able
to
have
the
effects,
and
do
the
things
claimed
for
the
drug
on
the
label.
the
congress
also
heard
at
these
hearings
of
the
importance,
in
ascertaining
the
effectiveness
of
drugs,
that
there
be
adequate
clinical
scientific
studies,
there
was
repeated
testimony
of,
much
of
which
which
have
summarized
in
our
brief
in
the
hynson
case,
repeated
testimony
that
you
cannot
determine
how
effective
a
drug
is,
merely
because
various
doctors
state
that
they
use
it
in
their
practice
and
they
found
it
worked,
there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
a
control.
mr.
freedman
the
anecdotal
testimony.
mr.
freedman
yes.
mr.
freedman
anecdotal.
the
doctor
said
he
treated
6
patients
for
this
condition
and
they
recovered,
yes.
that
–
the
congress
did
a
very
unusual
--
mr.
freedman
excuse
me.
mr.
freedman
not
normally
--
mr.
freedman
--
the
doctors
--
the
anecdotal
evidence
doesn't
bring
that.
mr.
freedman
anecdotal
as
distinguished
from
the
scientific
clinical
studies.
congress
did
a
rather
unusual
thing
in
this
statute,
because
of
the
evidence
before
it,
that
clinical
studies
were
important.
when
it
said
--
it
said
in
the
statue
that
the
secretary
should
not
approve
a
new
drug
application,
unless
he
found
by
'substantial
evidence'
it
was
effective,
it
went
on
and
defined
in
the
statue
what
it
meant
by
the
substantial
evidence.
now
substantial
evidence
under
this
statute
means
something
very
different
than
substantial
evidence
in
the
traditional
administrative
statutes.
it
defines
substantial
evidence
in
the
statute
as
constituting,
meaning,
adequate
and
well
controlled
investigations,
including
clinical
investigations
by
experts
qualified
by
scientific
training
and
experience,
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
a
drug
involved.
and
congress
also
expanded
the
definition
of
new
drug
to
cover
effectiveness,
so
that
a
new
drug
is
now
defined
as
one
not
generally
recognized
among
the
experts
qualified
by
scientific
training
and
experience,
to
evaluate
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
drugs.
two
other
things
that
the
statute
did
in
the
way
of
strengthening
the
administrative
authority
of
the
food
and
drug
authority;
first
under
the
predecessor
statute
in
1938,
a
drug
new
application
became
effective
automatically,
unless
the
secretary
affirmatively
disapproved
it.
this
was
changed
in
the
1962
act,
to
provide
that
the
application
did
not
become
effective
unless
the
secretary
affirmatively
approved
it.
the
statute
also
provided
that
after
an
interim
period
of
two
years
the
secretary
was
required,
if
on
the
basis
of
new
information
before
it,
there
was
a
lack
of
substantial
evidence
that
the
drug
will
have
the
effective,
proposes
to
have,
in
that
situation
the
secretary
was
to
withdraw
approval
of
the
new
drug
application.
finally,
there
is
in
the
statute
a
"grandfather"
clause,
which
i
will
not
go
into,
because
that
will
be
discussed
in
some
of
the
succeeding
cases,
under
which
certain
drugs
that
were
being
distributed
on
the
effective
date
of
the
statute
are
exempt
from
the
effectiveness
requirements
as
could
be
expected
as
a
shortest
agreement
between
the
government
and
the
companies
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
exemption.
now
--
mr.
freedman
statute
for
october
1962,
so
that
it
meant
that
until
october
10th
1964,
food
and
drug
could
not
began
proceeding
to
withdraw
the
new
drug
approvals,
on
the
ground
that
the
drugs
would
be
ineffective.
now
the
food
and
drug
administration
recognized
immediately
that
with
4000
new
drug
applications
outstanding,
approved
applications,
ndas,
it
just
couldn't
itself
undertake
with
it's
limited
staff
to
evaluate
everyone
of
these.
so
what
it
did
was,
it
called
upon
a
group
of
eminent
scientists,
the
national
academy
sciences
and
it's
constituent
national
research
council,
for
aid
in
determining
the
validity
of
the
effectiveness
claims
of
this
large
number
of
drugs.
and
what
the
national
academy
of
sciences
did
was,
it
set
up
panels;
30
panels,
each
panel
containing
6
experts
with
respect
to
the
particular
type
of
drug
involved.
the
companies
were
requested
to
submit
all
evidence
they
had
concerning
the
effectiveness
of
their
drugs
as
claimed
to
these
panels.
the
panels
then
evaluated
each
of
these
drugs,
and
made
recommendations
to
food
and
drug
with
respect
to
their
effectiveness.
they
evaluated
the
drugs,
and
what
happened
was
as
follows.
these
panels
found
all
of
these
drugs,
these
4000
ndas
that
were
reviewed,
7%
were
ineffective.
a
considerable
number
were
described
as
effective,
and
the
balance
was
somewhere
in
between,
they
described,
and
it
was
possibly
effective,
probably
effective,
effective,
but
effective
with
respect
to
some
claims
and
not
all.
many
of
the
labels
of
course
suggested
the
drug
was
suitable
for
more
than
one
condition,
and
of
the
4000
ndas,
there
were
approximately
16,000
claims,
and
the
national
academy
of
science
panels
found
that
only
19%
of
these
alleged
claims
of
effectiveness
were
valid.
after
these
studies
were
made
the
food
and
drug
administration
had
a
large
conference
with
the
industry
in
the
january
of
1968,
and
it
announced
that
it's
policy
would
be
to
apply
the
conclusions
of
the
national
academy
of
sciences
to
all
drugs,
not
only
to
the
drugs
that
were
covered
by
the
ndas,
but
also
by
the
'me-too'
drugs.
and
what
they
announced,
they
said
that
they
would
do,
is
they
would
issue
notices
and
opportunity
for
hearing,
whether
as
to
all
of
the
nda
manufacturers
whose
drugs
were
found
ineffective,
and
that
they
would
permit
the
'me-toos'
to
come
in
to
those
hearings
to
be
heard.
following
--
the
best
estimate
was
that
as
a
result
of
these
procedures,
they
would
have
to
conduct
something
like
a
thousand
hearings,
and
in
1969,
in
the
hope
of
making
this
problem
manageable,
they
issued
further
regulations
in
which
they
defined
what
would
constitute
an
adequate
and
well
controlled
study,
and
very
specifically
they
told
exactly
what
it
had
to
be,
and
they
also
said
that
if
a
manufacturer
requested
a
hearing,
they
would
not
grant
a
hearing
unless
he
produced
as
indicated
as
the
substantial
evidence
that
he
would
produce,
that
type
of
evidence,
that
is
the
well
controlled
studies.
the
validity
of
this
regulation
is
at
issue
in
another
one
of
these
cases.
and
then
finally
in
1972,
the
food
and
drug
administration
issued
another
regulation
which
more
specifically
put
the
'me-toos'
on
notice,
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
nda
for
the
so
called
the
"pioneer"
drugs
would
also
apply
to
the
'me-too'
drugs.
mr.
freedman
there
is
a
specific
general
authority
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations,
section
701
and
it's
a
very
broad
statute,
it
authorizes
them
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
necessary
for
the
effective
implementation
of
the
act.
there
is
no
specific
provision
giving
the
commissioner
authority
to
define
further,
what
constitutes
"substantial
evidence,"
but
we
believe
that
as
a
general
exercise
in
administrative
authority
this
broad
rule
making
power
does
permit
him
further
to
define
and
particularize
the
standard
of
"substantial
evidence,"
which
congress
provides.
he
is
not
changing
it,
he
is
merely
explaining
what
is
meant
by
well
conducted
clinical
studies
and
investigations.
now
we
think
that
this
legislative
history
that
i
have
given,
privatizes
and
brings
home
three
things,
which
i
just
like
to
reiterate
now,
because
i
think
they
are
critical
to
the
legal
issues
in
the
cases.
first,
by
the
1962
amendments,
congress
intended
to
take
off
the
market,
to
take
off
the
market
drugs
that
had
not
been
shown
to
be
effective.
and
congress
decided
to
do
this
primarily
by
expanding
the
authority
of
the
food
and
drug
administration,
it's
pre-marketing
clearance
authority
to
cover
effectiveness
as
well
as
safety.
it
required
that
the
definition
of
whether
a
drug
be
effective,
be
put
in
terms
of
high
probative
scientific
studies.
secondly,
as
i
think
i
have
indicated,
food
and
drug
was
faced
with
this
enormous
administrative
problem
and
it
couldn't
possibly
deal
with
the
situation
on
the
basis
of
a
drug-by-drug
procedure,
of
bringing
4000
separate
proceedings.
it
had
to
deal
with
it
on
a
more
comprehensive
basis
and
finally,
we
think
the
method
it
has
selected,
the
use
of
the
national
academy,
with
it's
panels
of
experts,
the
opportunity
given
to
the
manufacturers
to
come
in
after
the
scientific
studies
have
been
made
and
to
show
why
in
effect,
in
fact,
their
drugs
were
effective
in
accordance
with
their
claims
under
principles
of
adequate
and
well
controlled
clinical
investigations,
it
was
a
reasonable
and
fair
method
of
dealing
with
the
problem.
and
with
this
as
the
background,
i
now
would
like
to
turn
to
the
two
cases
i
am
going
to
argue,
the
bentex
case,
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
ciba
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit.
the
question
in
each
of
these
cases,
is
whether
the
food
an
drug
administration
has
jurisdiction
to
determine,
whether
a
product
is
a
new
drug
to
which
the
pre-marketing
clearance
procedures
and
the
withdrawal
procedures
of
section
505
of
the
statute
are
applicable.
our
contention
is
that
the
secretary
and
the
fda
does
have
that
authority.
the
fourth
circuit
held
and
the
respondents
contend
that
he
does
not,
and
as
they
view
his
authority,
the
only
thing
he
can
do
is
pass
upon
applications
for
new
drug
approvals
or
withdraw
previously
affective
applications.
he
cannot
according
to
their
theory
decide
the
threshold
question,
whether
or
not,
something
is
a
new
drug.
bentex
involves
a
drug
to
deal
with
the
mental
problems
of
senility.
now
bentex
is
a
'me-too'
manufacturer.
there
is
no
nda
outstanding
for
bentex
as
product,
but
prior
to
1962,
there
were
three
ndas
outstanding
for
a
similar
product.
upon
its
review
of
these
drugs,
the
national
science
foundation
panel
concluded
that
these
drugs
were
in
affective
for
their
stated
purposes.
after
evaluating
the
academy
studies,
food
and
drug
concluded
preliminary
that
there
was
not
'substantial
evidence'
of
effectiveness,
and
put
out
a
notice
of
hearing,
so
stating
and
giving
the
manufacturers
of
these
three
drugs
the
opportunity
to
request
a
hearing,
to
show
why
the
drug
was
effective,
and
it
also
invited
any
interested
persons
who
might
be
adversely
affected
by
the
removal
of
these
drugs
from
the
market
to
participate
it.
and
finally
the
notices
stated
that
withdrawal
of
ndas
for
these
three
drugs
will
cause
any
such
drug
on
the
market
to
be
a
new
drug
for
which
an
approved
new
drug
application
is
not
in
effect,
and
will
make
it
subject
to
regulatory
action.
one
of
the
three
nda
holders
submitted
some
material
which
food
and
drug
found
was
not
the
substantial
evidence
as
defined
by
the
statute.
and
after
a
second
notice
published
in
the
federal
register,
which
again
gave
interested
parties
the
opportunity
to
come
in,
and
which
again
pointed
out
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
nda
would
cause
the
'me-toos'
to
be
new
drugs.
food
and
drug
administration
withdrew
its
approval
of
the
three
ndas
covering
this
drug.
no
court
review
was
sought
of
that
action
by
the
three
nda
manufacturers.
now
under
food
and
drug's
view
of
law,
the
withdrawal
of
the
nda
also
had
the
affect
of
making
the
'me-toos'
into
new
drugs,
subject
to
the
pre-marketing
clearance,
and
accordingly
food
and
drug
sent
out
letters
to
a
number
of
manufacturers
of
the
'me-too'
drugs
pointing
this
at
to
them,
and
it
specifically
sent
such
a
letter
to
bentex
as
reprinted
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
asking
bentex
what
its
intentions
were
with
respect
to
removing
this
drug
from
the
market?
mr.
freedman
well,
we
don't
know
--
mr.
freedman
we
don't
know
--
we
are
not
sure
that
these
are
all
'me-too'
drugs.
we
do
know
that
22
of
these
people
brought
this
lawsuit.
they
sent
out
to
those
that
they
knew
about
it.
i
think
they
are
informed
people,
they
have
some
knowledge.
they
may
not
have
gotten
all
for
me.
mr.
freedman
there
is
no
real
way,
except
for
the
drug
registration
statute,
and
that
will
no
be
effective
till
to
june
of
this
year.
mr.
freedman
that's
right.
they
did
had
no
way,
but
they
did
know,
they
did
know
at
least
that
bentex
and
some
of
others
were
manufacturing
this
drug.
now
the
response
of
bentex
to
this
request
for
information
as
to
what
it
was
going
to
do
remove
the
drug
from
the
market,
was
to
bring
to
a
lawsuit
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
in
which
bentex
is
joined
by
22
other
'me-too'
manufactures.
they
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
that
their
products
were
not
new
drugs,
and
were
not
subject
to
the
application
procedures
of
section
505.
the
government
--
the
district
court
moved
to
dismiss
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
determine
this
question,
that
this
was
a
--
we
made
two
arguments.
one,
that
this
was
a
matter
within
the
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
to
food
and
drug
and
secondly,
that
since
bentex
had
had
the
opportunity
to
come
into
the
proceedings
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
ndas,
bentex
was
barred
from
litigating
this
question
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
rejected
those
arguments,
and
held
that
it
and
food
and
drug
had
concurrent
jurisdiction,
but
it
also
rejected
the
plaintiffs'
contention
in
that
lawsuit
that
the
district
court
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
question
of
new
drug
status.
and
what
it
said
was,
that
the
authority
of
the
food
and
drug
administration
to
approve,
or
withhold
approval
of
the
ndas,
necessarily
implies
authority
for
food
and
drug
to
determine
the
threshold
question
of
whether
the
article
involved
is
a
drug
which
requires
an
approved
new
drug
application
for
lawful
interstate
shipment?
and
the
court
then
said,
that
it
thought
it
was
appropriate
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
should
decide
this
question
in
the
first
instance,
because
it
said,
the
nature
of
the
proof
relevant
to
that
issue
makes
food
and
drug
the
more
able
arbitrator
of
the
question.
so
the
evaluation
of
conflicting
reports
in
the
field
is
not
a
matter
well
left
to
a
court
without
chemical
or
medical
background.
and
accordingly,
the
district
court
deferred
any
proceedings
in
the
case,
until
food
and
drug
had
an
opportunity
to
conduct
a
hearing
on
the
new
drug
issue.
the
government
did
not
appeal
that
aspect
of
the
case,
and
has
accepted
the
remand.
though
i
want
to
make
it
quite
clear
to
the
court
that
while
we
do,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
in
this
case,
plan
to
hold
a
hearing,
we
do
not
contemplate
that
the
hearing
will
be
of
the
typical
evidentiary
trial
type
hearing.
we
think
it
will
be
appropriate
to
conduct
a
hearing
along
the
rule
making
lines
which
the
agency
is
now
using
in
this
case.
mr.
freedman
yes.
mr.
freedman
well,
there
are
--
mr.
freedman
well
--
mr.
freedman
well,
that's
a
matter
of
disagreement.
again,
it's
the
statutory
definition
of
new
drug,
one
which
is
generally
recognized
among
this
group
of
experts
as
being
effective
for
it
uses.
and
that
we
think
as
mr.
frey
will
develop,we
think
that
the
general
recognition
standard
in
the
statute
is
something
in
addition
to
the
'substantial
evidence.'
that
is,
we
think
that
if
a
panel
of
experts
concludes
that
there's
not
substantial
evidence
based
on
well
conducted
clinical
studies
to
show
that
the
drug
is
effective,
the
same
experts
could
not
--
mr.
freedman
--
possibly
be
recognize
its
general
effectiveness.
we
think
the
recognition
is
something
else,
that's
the
issue.
and
for
example,
there
maybe
questions
in
these
cases,
they
claim
that
they
are
not
a
new
drug,
because
the
'me-too,'
the
nda
drugs
contain
an
additional
element
that
their
drug
doesn't
contain.
they
say
one
of
the
drugs
was
administered
intravenously,
another
is
orally
and
that's
the
distinction.
so
there
are
two
questions
really;
one
--
mr.
freedman
that
is
another
claim,
that
is
a
claim.
they
also
claimed
that
it
is
covered
by
the
'grandfather'
exemption.
mr.
freedman
that's
another
problem.
mr.
freedman
not
a
rule
making
title.
what
i
am
suggesting
mr.
justice
is,
we
do
not
contemplate
that
there
would
be
a
hearing
in
the
sense
of
a
trial
type
hearing
at
which
large
number
of
doctors
will
take
the
stand
and
give
their
opinion.
they
will
have
full
opportunity
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
commissioner
all
pertinent
material
bearing
on
their
claim,
that
their
drug
is
not
a
new
drug,
because
it
is
effective
or
because
it's
covered
by
the
'grandfather'
exemption.
mr.
freedman
i
think
that
is
an
issue,
because
of
the
fact
that
in
one
of
the
other
cases
a
hearing
was
denied,
because
of
the
failure
of
the
parties
to
produce
the
kind
of
evidence
requisite.
mr.
freedman
to
these
drugs;
i
use
the
word
rule
making
perhaps
too
loosely.
what
i
would
suggest
it
would
be
a
hearing
appropriate,
concerning
all
the
circumstances
for
determining
this
question
which
is
not
the
same
thing
as
the
kind
of
a
hearing
to
decide
for
an
instance
whether
an
employer
fired
a
man
for
his
union
activities
or
for
inefficiency.
mr.
freedman
yes,
it
would
be
a
hearing
to
determine
--
mr.
freedman
on
the
record,
and
we
say,
and
would
be
traditionally
revealable.
mr.
freedman
well,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
statute
has
to
--
mr.
freedman
whether
it
would
be
to
establish
a
definition,
a
determination
as
to
whether
this
type
of
drug,
whether
this
type
of
drug
is
effective
and
there
would
be
i
suppose
two
issues.
one
would
be
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
these
people’s
drugs
are
--
they
would
have
the
opportunity
under
this
particular
hearing
procedure
to
come
in
and
produce
any
additional
evidence
not
before,
for
example,
the
national
academy
proceedings,
why
their
drug
is
effective?
that
is
if
they
had
well
established
studies
that
had
not
been
presented,
they
could
present
those
to
the
commissioner.
in
addition,
they
could
come
in
and
explain
why
they
think
their
drug
is
different
from
the
fda
drug,
so
that
their
drug,
whatever
one
might
say
as
to
the
nda
drug,
as
to
why
the
'me-too'
drugs
are
not
new
drugs?
why
their
drugs
are
effective
even
though
the
'me-too'
drugs
have
been
--
although
the
fda
drugs
have
been
determined
not
to
be
effective.
if
i
may
just
--
mr.
freedman
that's
a
word
of
art,
mr.
justice.
mr.
freedman
if
it
makes
it
effective
under
the
standards,
if
it
makes
it
effective
under
this
standards,
then
it
would
not
be
a
new
drug.
in
other
words,
if
it
was
effective,
if
it's
effective,
then
it
does
not
have
to
meet
with
the
--
mr.
freedman
that's
under
the
theory,
because
he
had
the
opportunity
to
come
in.
now
we
are
not
arguing
that
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
are
not
arguing,
but
it's
--
mr.
freedman
pardon?
mr.
freedman
no,
it's
not
in
one
of
them.
what
is
is
the
question
is,
whether
the
kind
of
evidence
they
have
to
produce,
they
have
to
produce
that.
mr.
freedman
yes.
but
we
are
not
contending
in
this
case,
we
are
not
contending
in
this
case,
that
they
are
barred.
that's
what
we
argued
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
rejected,
that
was
in
the
field,
although
for
the
future
we
are
going
to
take
position,
if
they
had
the
opportunity
to
come
in
and
produce
all
the
evidence
in
the
proceeding,
and
if
they
don't
do
it,
they
are
barred.
now
the
court
of
appeal
just
briefly
held
in
this
case
that
the
--
mr.
freedman
--
fourth
circuit
in
the
bentex
case
held
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
has
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
new
drug
applications.
it
said
basically
that
the
statute
has
two
different
procedures.
food
and
drug
can
do
nothing,
but
pass
on
applications
for
approval
and
withdraw
approved
applications
if
it
finds
that
they
are
not,
the
drug
isn't
effective,
but
it
cannot
do
anything
in
the
way
of
trying
to
determine
the
threshold
question
of
whether
something
is
a
new
drug.
that
they
said
is
a
question
solely
for
the
district
court
to
be
decided
either
in
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
brought
by
the
manufacturers
or
to
be
decided
by
the
district
court
when
the
government
moves
against
the
drug.
now,
and
i
will
just
briefly
turn
to
the
facts
in
the
ciba
case,
which
presents
the
same
issue
though
in
a
different
context.
ciba
did
have
an
nda,
and
its
drug
was
reveiwed
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences,
the
claims
were
found
ineffective.
they
went
through
a
whole
series
of
procedures,
notices
were
given.
the
climax
of
this
was
that
food
and
drug
withdrew
the
nda
for
ciba’s
drug.
ciba
took
that
question
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
at
this
point
--
in
the
interval,
ciba
then
filed
a
district
court
suit
in
new
jersey,
in
which
ciba
claimed
that
it
was
not
a
new
drug,
and
that
it
was
exempt,
and
it
wanted
to
have
that
issue
determined.
the
district
court
dismissed,
the
third
circuit
affirmed,
basically
following
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
in
the
bentex
case
saying
that
when
food
and
drug
undertook
to
withdraw
the
new
drug
application,
that
it
necessarily
had
--
must
have
decided
the
threshold
question
of
whether
it
was
a
new
drug,
that
ciba
challenged
the
order
of
food
and
drug
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
that
decision,
it
will
also
upheld
the
determination
that
this
was
a
new
drug.
now,
the
problem
in
this
case
and
the
reason
we
think
that
the
third
circuit
is
correct
and
the
fourth
circuit
is
in
error
is
that
--
mr.
freedman
no,
the
third
circuit
said
that
the
food
and
drug
administration
had
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
new
drug
question
that
it
had
necessarily
decided
it
when
it
withdrew
the
application
that,
that
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
and
there
was
no
occasion
for
ciba
to
be
permitted
to
re-litigate
the
new
drug
question
in
an
independent
suit
brought
--
mr.
freedman
no,
it
did
not
-
-
all
that
it
held
was
that
food
and
drug
did
have
jurisdiction
and
that
of
course
is
the
only
issue
directly
involved
in
these
cases
whether
the
food
and
drug
has
jurisdiction.
now
the
problem
we
have
with
the
decisions
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case,
and
the
contentions
of
the
respondent
is
that
it
would
basically
transfer
to
the
district
courts,
to
the
district
courts
the
primary
enforcement
responsibility,
that
is,
it
would
bar
food
and
drug
from
making
these
threshold
determinations,
even
though
congress
in
the
1962
statute
made
it's
intention
quite
clear
that
it
intended
to
strengthen
the
hand
of
food
and
drug
in
withdrawing
from
the
market
the
drugs
posed,
stated
to
be
ineffective.
mr.
freedman
oh
yes,
that
will,
under
that
theory
it
would
be
a
de
novo
proceeding.
mr.
freedman
it
can
initiate
in
that
matter
mr.
justice,
but
it
cannot
deal
with
the
vast
bulk
of
these
applications,
because
prosecution
is
not
really
--
in
this
field
is
not
an
effective
method.
it's
not
an
effective
method
for
getting
off
the
market
these
thousands
of
drugs
which
seemingly
on
the
basis
of
the
national
academy
of
science
and
studies
are
ineffective.
that
is
to
the
whole
purpose,
the
whole
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
give
food
and
drug
administrative
authority,
to
do
the
job
that
it
had
not
been
able
to
do
under
the
1938
act.
and
the
issues
for
example
in
defining
the
new
drug
as
distinguished
from
determining
whether
there
was
'substantial
evidence'
of
effectiveness.
there
is
a
disagreement
between
the
parties
as
to
exactly
what
the
standards.
but
however
one
defines
the
standard,
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
kind
of
question,
it's
a
kind
of
question
that
calls
for
expert
skills
and
knowledge.
these
are
analysis
of
detailed
scientific
information
from
ecological
studies.
it's
the
kind
of
thing,
it's
the
kind
of
thing,
the
kind
of
expert
issue
that
traditionally
is
for
the
administrative
agencies.
and
we
think
the
district
court
in
the
bentex
case
was
well
warranted
in
sending
this
matter
to
food
and
drug.
it's
traditional
that
administrative
agencies
have
authority
to
determine
their
own
jurisdiction,
that's
the
threshold
question.
when
a
claim
is
made
that
somebody,
to
an
agency,
that
someone
is
doing
something
in
violation
of
a
statute
the
agency
administers,
the
first
question
the
agency
has
to
decide,
is
whether
or
not
the
thing
is
covered
by
the
statute?
before
you
decide
whether
there
is
a
violation,
you
decide
it
whether
the
statute
is
covered.
and
before
you
can
decide
whether
or
not
a
new
drug
application
is
required,
you'll
have
to
find
out
whether
it's
a
new
drug,
and
it
seems
to
us
rather
incongruous
to
suggest
that
congress
which
attempted
to
strengthen
fda's
authority
in
the
1962
amendments,
intended
to
deny
to
fda
this
kind
of
authority
to
determine
it's
own
jurisdiction
that
agencies
traditionally
have.
mr.
freedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
like
to
say
two
things
briefly
in
rebuttal.
first
in
response
to
a
colloquially
that
justice
stewart
had
with
mr.
szuch.
the
fda
on
many
occasions
has
sent
back
applications
that
had
been
filed
for
new
drugs
on
the
ground
that
nobody
--
that
it
was
not
needed,
i.e.
that
it
wasn't
a
new
drug.
secondly
i
just
want
to
stress
--
it
seems
to
us
that
the
anomaly
of
the
respondent's
position
here
is
well
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
the
ciba
case
itself.
the
reason
food
and
drug
initiated
a
withdrawal
proceeding
in
the
ciba
case
was
because
it
had
reason
to
believe
that
ciba's
drug
was
ineffective
and
it
wanted
to
stop
ciba
from
marketing
that.
it
held
a
full
proceeding.
it
concluded
that
ciba's
drug
was
ineffective.
it
withdrew
the
nda
and
that
action
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now
under
this
theory
that
food
and
drug
is
no
authority
to
determine
the
new
drug
status,
this
whole
proceeding
was
amounted
to
basically
annuity
because
ciba
now
claims
it
can
turn
around
and
re-litigate
under
the
new
drug
standard
in
the
district
court,
the
question
whether
or
not
it's
able
to
market
it
at
all.
mr.
freedman
it
could
be
prosecuted
mr.
justice
but
again
i
come
back
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
freedman
there
could
be,
there
could
be
a
seizure.
but
i
come
back
to
the
fact
once
again
that
is
just
not
a
practical
method
of
dealing
with
this
large
number
of
drugs
that
we
have.
you
just
cannot
accomplish
the
congressional
purpose
of
getting
these
ineffective
drugs
off
the
market,
but
the
only
thing
that
food
and
drug
can
do
is
that
when
it
finds
one
that
it
thinks
is
ineffective
is
to
bring
the
suit
in
the
district
court
to
enjoin
them
to
seize
the
drug
or
to
prosecute
them
criminally.
mr.
freedman
it
depends
on
the
type
of
action.
if
it's
the
action
in
either
denying
a
new
drug
application
or
withdrawing
the
effective
nda
that
would
be
under
section
505
(a)
that
permits
court
review
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
the
route
of
course,
ciba
followed.
if
it's
in
a
determination
by
the
food
and
drug
administration
made
declaratory
judgment
that
would
be
reviewable
we
think
in
the
district
court
under
the
administrative
procedure.
mr.
frey
will
now
continue
the
argument.
