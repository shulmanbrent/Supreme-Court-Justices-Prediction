mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
truth
in
lending
act
is
an
important
elaborate,
a
very
complex
piece
of
social
legislation,
designed
and
indented
to
cover
an
enormous,
absolutely
enormous
array
of
consumer
credit
transactions.
in
light
of
the
complexities
involved,
congress
gave
the
federal
reserve
board
very
broad
powers
to
implement
the
purposes
of
the
act,
to
construe
it
and
to
interpret
it,
to
adopt
regulations
in
order
to
facilitate
compliance
and
so
forth.
the
four
installment
rule
is
not
an
interpretation
of
the
act.
it
is
not
a
construction
of
the
act.
it
does
not
come
under
all
those
rubrics
like
udall
and
tallman
of
a
contemporaneous
interpretation.
the
four
installment
rule
is
an
amendment
to
the
act.
it
rewrites
the
act.
it
rewrites
the
very
definitions
of
the
act
and
the
operative
provisions
of
the
act.
and
i
submit
that
because
it
brings
within
the
scope
of
the
civil
and
criminal
penalties
of
the
act,
both
of
which
can
be
quite
segregate.
it
is
invalid
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
explicit
language
an
intention
of
congress.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
calling
the
court's
attention
to
these
specific
statutory
provisions
on
which
we
rely.
the
portions
i
am
relying
are
set
forth
that
the
appendix
to
our
blue
brief
starting
at
the
page
1a.
first,
congress
declared
its
purpose.
it
said
that
the
informed
use
of
credit
results
from
an
awareness
of
a
cost
thereof
by
consumers
and
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
act
to
disclose
that
cost.
i
can
emphasis
too
strongly
that
what
the
act
deals
with
from
beginning
to
end
is
the
cost
of
credit,
not
the
business
costs
of
the
businessman
who
may
vary
his
charges
or
un-vary
them
but
the
cost
to
the
consumer.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
price,
the
cost.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
price
of
credit,
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement,
which
for
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
called
the
finance
charge,
a
bundled
word.
now,
they
go
on
in
the
definitions
to
define
the
term
creditor
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
act.
the
term
creditor,
it
says
in
1602
f,
refers
only
to
creditors
who
regularly
extend
or
arrange
for
the
extension
of
credit
for
which
the
payment
of
a
finance
charge
is
required.
the
provisions
of
this
sub-chapter
apply
to
any
such
creditor
irrespective
of
its
status.
so
at
the
very
outset,
the
congress
is
saying
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
creditors
who
impose
finance
charges
and
there
are
creditors
who
don't
impose
finance
charges.
we
are
talking
about
the
ones
who
did.
the
next
critical
section
or
i
should
add
at
that
point,
that
the
rewriting
of
the
act
begins
at
that
point.
the
federal
reserve
board's
definition
of
credit
omits
the
phrase,
for
which
the
payment
of
a
finance
charge
is
required.
that's
in
regulation
to
226.2
m
at
page
10a
of
our
brief.
the
next
section,
the
next
critically
operative
section
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
submit
that
the
act
does
not
distinguish
between
identified
and
unidentified
finance
charges,
hidden
or
patent
finance
charges.
it
says
finance
charges
imposed
by
a
creditor
must
in
all
circumstances
be
disclosed
without
question.
now,
i
add
the
proposition,
that
congress
did
not
share.
the
solicitor
general's
view
or
the
reserve
board's
view,
that
every
creditor
imposes
a
finance
charge
in
some
ambient
economic
sense.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
law
guarantee
that
you
are
going
to
stay
in
business
as
fois
discovered.
people
do
not
always
recover
their
cost
from
their
customers.
but
there
are
more
simple
situations.
a
patient
comes
to
a
doctor,
has
a
major
operation,
and
the
doctor
says,
well
my
fee
for
removing
your
appendix
is
$2,000,
i
know
you
can't
pay
me
for
it
now,
pay
me
$100
a
week
for
the
next
20
weeks.
no
one
in
his
right
mind,
i
think,
suppose
that
doctor
is
imposing
a
finance
charge
but
the
federal
reserve
board
says
he
is
subject
to
the
four
installment
rule.
doctor,
of
course
has
a
cost
of
business.
he
has
to
pay
his
telephone
operator,
his
nurse,
for
his
stethoscope,
and
do
whatever
doctors
do.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
oh,
i
quite
agree.
if
it
is
shown
that
the
normal
price,
this
doctor
has
been
contemporary
for
an
appendectomy
is
$1,000,
but
he
charged
$2,000
for
letting
a
patient
pay
it
for
over
two
years.
you
prove
a
finance
charge
just
simply
as
that.
and
i
--
if
the
board
wants
to
regulate
that,
i
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all,
i
think
the
act
regulates
and
requires
that
the
doctor
disclose
in
those
circumstances.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
there
are
in
fact,
in
practical
experience
as
we
all
know
situations
in
which
the
fee,
the
charge,
the
cost
imposed
on
a
customer
does
not
in
fact
vary
with
defermative
payments.
and
at
least
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
that
the
seller
experience
the
cost?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
which
he
may
or
may
not
pass
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
which
he
may
or
may
not
realize
and
he
may
or
may
not
impose
on
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
true,
that
is
correct.
now,
i
turn
to
section
(16)
(31)
(a)
of
the
act
which
is
the
page
6(a)
of
our
appendix
in
our
brief.
and
this
is
the
general
disclosure
requirement.
it
says
that
each
creditors
,
we
have
already
defined
each
creditor
to
mean
creditors
who
regularly
impose
finance
charges.
if
such
creditor
in
accordance
with
regulations
prescribed
by
the
board
shall
disclose
to
each
person
to
whom
credit
is
extended
and
upon
whom
a
finance
charge
is
or
maybe
imposed,
the
information
required
under
this
part.
so
not
only
you
start
with
a
class
of
creditors
who
imposed
finance
charges,
you
go
on
to
those
transactions
in
which
they
in
fact
imposed
them
as
congress
has
wrote.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
maybe
there.
there
has
been
some
temptation
i
think,
in
the
briefs
for
the
government
and
petitioner,
suppose
that
maybe
means
maybe,
perhaps
it
is
there
and
perhaps
it
isn't.
it
clearly
doesn't
mean
that.
it
is
meant
that
word
'may'
as
defined
in
the
act
does
not
carrying
forward
into
the
code
except
the
footnote.
'may'
is
defined
as
an
act
that
is
authorized
or
permative.
in
other
words,
if
the
contract
says
you
may
defer
your
payments
and
if
you
do
so
after
the
first
30
days,
the
interest
rate
will
be
5%,
that's
a
situation
in
which
interest
--
finance
charge
maybe
imposed
pursuant
to
the
agreement.
so
to
some
conditions
it's
subsequent,
but
it
doesn't
mean
might
be
or
can't
tell
whether
it's
there
or
not.
it
doesn't
mean
maybe.
contrary
to
the
government's
--
contrary
to
the
petitioner's
suggestion
at
pages
12
and
13
of
its
brief,
the
act
does
not
impose
the
disclosure
requirements
on
all
credit
transactions,
even
of
those
who
regularly
impose
finance
charges
but
only
in
those
transactions
in
which
a
finance
charge
was
imposed.
now
the
legislative
history
behind
section
1631
shed
some
light
at
this
point.
the
senate
and
house
reports
--
the
senate
report
is
quoted
at
page
17
and
18
of
our
brief,
say
that
this
language
in
1631,
the
language
upon
whom
finance
charges
maybe
imposed
is
intended
to
make
clear
that
disclosure
need
only
be
made
to
persons
upon
whom
finance
charges
maybe
imposed.
thus
the
disclosure
requirement
would
not
apply
to
transactions
which
are
not
commonly
thought
of
as
credit
transactions,
including
trade
credit,
open
account
credit,
30,
60,
or
90
day
credit,
etcetera,
for
which
a
charge
is
not
made.
congress
didn't
have
to
say
that,
it
didn't
have
to
go
out
of
its
way
to
say
that.
it
was
briefly
simple
to
a
middle
office
language
but
it
has
reiterated
now
three
times
that
what
it's
talking
about
is
the
imposition
of
a
cost
of
credit.
finally
--
well
and
ultimately,
the
act
sets
forth,
the
disclosures
are
to
be
made,
those
are
contained
in
two
sections
in
1637,
which
sets
forth
the
disclosures
for
open
ended
credit,
charge
accounts,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
that
is
not
in
our
brief.
the
disclosures
required
there
include
the
conditions
under
which
a
finance
charge
maybe
imposed,
the
method
of
determining
the
balance
upon
which
a
finance
charge
will
be
imposed,
the
method
of
determining
the
amount
of
the
finance
charge,
and
such
like.
in
1638
which
is
the
section
applicable
if
any
is
applicable
here,
they
talked
about
the
cash
price
and
so
on.
going
on
to
the
total
amount
to
be
financed,
the
amount
of
the
finance
charge,
the
financed
charge
expressed
as
an
annual
percentage
rate
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
am
trying
to
show
mr.
justice
white
that
the
regulation
is
inconsistent
with
the
manifest
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
sir.
yes,
he
did.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
right.
i
might
say
in
that
connection
that
1638
demonstrates
the
quandary
created
by
imposing,
by
validating
the
four
installment
rule.
because
if
the
four
installment
rule
applies
and
you
are
required
to
make
the
disclosures,
calls
whereby
1638,
you
are
called
upon
to
make
a
disclosure
of
your
finance
charge,
and
the
annual
percentage
rate,
and
you
are
supposed
to
do
it
precisely.
no
one
has
given
us
any
clue
as
to
how
if
their
economic
theory
not
shared
by
congress
is
correct,
how
we
are
supposed
to
ascertain
it,
what
we
have
been
told
is
that
the
federal
reserve
board
doesn't
know
how
to
ascertain
it
and
that
the
whole
committee
of
homers,
who
opposed
these
regulations
didn't
know
how
to
do
it.
but
we
must
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
transactions
each
year,
do
it
at
(inaudible)
of
a
liability
of
$100
to
every
customer
and
if
criminalized.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
federal
reserve
board
has
suggested
not
by
regulation
but
by
the
way
informally,
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
said,
well
maybe
you
don't
have
to
disclose
the
finance
charge
and
the
percentage
rate,
after
all
if
it’s
hard
to
do.
how
that
waiver
of
the
requirements
of
the
act,
furthers
the
purposes
of
the
act,
as
having
brought
within
the
ambit
of
the
act,
a
large
class
of
people
who
everyone
thought
didn't
have
finance
charges
and
then
say,
well
you
don't
have
to
disclose
your
finance
charges
after
all.
how
that
furthers
the
purpose
of
the
disclosure
of
credit
terms,
i
don't
really
see.
but
whether
or
not
the
statement
by
the
board
that
you
don't
have
to
make
those
disclosures
would
bind
mrs.
mourning
in
her
suit
or
any
of
the
other
people
who
brought
suit
or
indeed
would
bind
any
grand
jury
that
wanted
to
begin
a
criminal
proceedings
under
this
act.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
let
me
say
that--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
we
had
a
time
price
differential,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
just
a
second,
just
to
finish
with
the
act,
i
just
have
one
last
section
to
call
your
attention
to
the
act,
the
section
under
which
this
suit
actually
arise
is
1640,
finally
wraps
it
all
up
by
saying
that
if
you
violated,
if
you
failed
to
make
the
disclosures,
the
liability
imposed
is
twice
the
amount
of
the
finance
charged
in
connection
with
the
transaction.
so,
congress
apparently
thought
that
the
finance
charge
was
there
and
that
it
was
sufficiently
ascertainable
to
be
used
as
a
convenient
measuring
rod
for
the
really
penalties.
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
compensatory,
it
isn't
damage,
it's
a
penalty.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
you
multiply
it
by
250,000
customers
then
it
is
a
staggering
penalty.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
they
say
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
minimum
amount
of
$100
per
person,
250,000
customers
a
year
that's
$45,000,000.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
as
far
as
congress,
robinson,
harman
in
another
case
as
where
congress
left
though
the
act
clearly
didn't
apply.
let
me
go
now
to
the
--
what
you
are
raising
mr.
justice
stewart.
our
footnote
concerning
that
our
discovery
quite
late
in
the
day,
i
can
see
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
our
selling
operations
apparently
had
closed
down.
that
in
some
few
instances,
there
was
indication
that
some
customers
who
pay
cash
did
not
pay
the
full
price.
i
thought
candor
required
me
to
call
but
to
the
court's
attention
but
i
think
it
is
also
totally
irrelevant.
the
complaint
in
this
action,
indeed
the
second
amended
complaint
does
not
allege
that
there
was
a
finance
charge.
the
case
was
presented
in
the
district
court
on
the
plaintiff's
notion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
proposition
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
was
a
finance
charge
or
not
and
the
plaintiff
had
no
interest
in
proving
it
because
he
relied
entirely
on
regulation
z.
the
district
court
didn't
find
that
there
was
a
finance
charge,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
find
that
there
was
a
finance
charge
and
i
don't
think
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
the
plaintiff
can
now
rely
on
the
proposition
that
maybe
there
was
a
finance
charge
there.
that
isn't
the
case
that's
presented.
i
will
say
that
if
there
were
a
finance
charge
in
the
transaction,
regulation
z
is
wholly
irrelevant.
we
are
clearly
responsible
to
disclose
it
and
liable.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
to
me,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
was
not.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
district
court
said
that
the
letters
written
after
the
contract,
the
dunning
letters
written
to
mrs.
mourning,
evidenced
that,
it
was
credit
that
the
non-cancelable
provisions
of
the
contract,
the
statement
of
the
contract
was
non-cancelable,
needed
a
credit
of
transaction.
and
it's
one
of
the
ground
that
the
--
i
think
there
is
an
exemplary
of
the
grounds
he
went
on,
he
certainly
did
not
rely
on
the
proposition
that
fps,
family
publication
service
had
incurred
cost
and
paid
money
to
publishers
which
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
except
these
dunning
letters.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
he
did.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
a
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
he
did.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
was
no
trial.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
were
affidavits.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
only
the
dunning
letters
that
have
been
described.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
question
as
all
the
parties
here
agree.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
on
the
--
since
the
only
document
that
is
relevant,
is
an
document
that
all
of
the
parties,
i
think
concede
as
an
unambiguous
contract
and
that
is,
that
is
what
tells
you
whether
it's
a
credit
transaction
as
a
matter
of
law
or
not.
that
this
court
could
readily
proceed
to
determine
that
this
was
not
a
credit
transaction.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
does
and
i
must
say
as
i
read
some
of
the
opinions
that
have
been
issued
by
the
federal
reserve
board,
they
seem
to
be
reading
out
the
credit
requirement
of
the
act
as
well.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it's
not
the
regulation,
it's
more
the
regulation
as
applied
that
lead
to
reading
it
out
because
what
they
keep
saying
that
they
are
interested
in
is
disclosing
the
sum
total
of
installment
payments
and
they
have
gone
after
getting
the
statement
of
the
sum
of
installment
payments
to
be
disclosed
but
installment
agreements,
not
all
installment
agreements,
are
credit
agreements
and
that's
perfectly
fundamental,
and
i
think
the
federal
reserve
board
has
lost
track
of
that.
an
example
was
given
in
one
of
the
hearings
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
they
have
lost
track
of
it
in
this
case
too.
i
should
say
that
the
government
below
declined
to
take
a
position
of
whether
it
was
credit
and
expressed
no
opinion
at
all,
in
its
amicus
participation.
perhaps
that
was
why
fifth
circuit
never
reached
the
question.
i
am
not
quite
clear
what
position
i
take
on
the
credit
question
here,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear,
if
you
look
at
the
opinions,
opinion
letters
that
the
board
has
issued
that
they
are
reading
out
diminishing
the
requirement
of
credit
in
these
installment
contracts.
now
that's
the
underlying
rationale
of
what
they
are
trying
to
do
here.
they
keep
telling
us,
you
don't
have
to
disclose
the
finance
charge
that
would
be
too
hard.
but
what
you
have
to
disclose
is
the
sum
total
of
installment
payments.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
we
were
cross
motions
for
summary
judgments.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
that
seems
to
me
that
the
contract
on
its
base
is
really
the
answer
to
whether
or
not
it
is,
that's
what
the
district
judge
thought
too,
he
said
the
acceleration
cost,
their
brand,
i
have
forgotten,
the
non-cancel
of
the
provision
and
perhaps
also
the
dunning
letters,
came
together
to
support
that
conclusion.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
i
don't
think
so--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
would
think
that
when
i
go
to
buy
a
car
on
time
from
general
motors'
dealer,
it
really
whether
my
relationship
with
him
is
a
credit
relationship,
doesn't
depend
upon
whether
he
has
already
bought
the
car
from
general
motors
and
he
has
been
holding
it
or
he
plans
to
buy
in
the
future
from
general
motors.
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is,
is
he
extending
the
credit,
not
what
he
is
doing
with
his
money,
how
he
raises
his
money.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
buyer
is
extending
credit
to
the
publisher
that
is
exactly
what
is
happening
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
district
court
didn't
hear--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
our
answer
to
the
complaint
did
say
at
no
point
during
the
life
of
the
contract
has
defended,
that's
fps
paid
money
to
a
third
person
or
supplied
goods
or
services
to
the
customer
for
which
reimbursement
is
expected
from
the
customer
in
the
future.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
paid
magazine
publishers
after
we
received
payment
from
the
customer,
and
that
is
not
clearly
established
in
the
record,
but
district
court
thought
it
was
irrelevant,
and
not
necessary
to
its
conclusion,
and
i
think
the
grounds
on
which
the
district
court
relied
are
legal
error.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
one
of
the
reasons
for
acceleration
clause
is
precisely
that
we
did
not
care
to
become
creditors;
we
wanted
to
be
paid
in
advance.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
were
willing
to
be
paid
at
sort
of
double
the
rate
--
but
if
they
fell
into
the
pot
we
wanted
the
whole
amount
in
advance
but
we
didn't
want
to
be
sending
magazines
to
people
who
had
not
paid
us.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes
we
would
be
substantially
in
mrs.
mournings'
debts.
she
would
have
paid
us
$122,
three
magazines.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
in
the
original
contract,
it
says--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
if
it's
credit
running
from
mrs.
mourning
to
us
the
act
doesn't
apply
because
it
only
applies
the
other
way
around.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
the
answer
is
it
applies
only
to
consumers.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
on
this
record,
it
will
at
least
to
be
remanded
to
the
fifth
circuit
to
consider
the
question.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
difference
between
affirming
with
the
fifth
circuit
on
another
ground
that
it
didn't
reach
and
reversing
it
on
a
ground
that
it
didn't
consider.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
it
would
be
more
conformable
to
the
normal
practice
of
the
court
in
those
circumstances
to
remand
it
to
fifth
circuit
and
that
may
be
in
the
last
analysis
you
have
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
for
an
evidentiary
examination
of
the
question.if
i
am
right
then
you
can
answer
the
question
on
the
face
of
the
contract,
it
seems
to
be,
it
can
be
answered
here
as
well
as
in
the
other
court.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
could
see
the
court
saying
that
it
ought
to
reach
the
credit
argument
first,
i
think
it
was
thrown
off
that
normal
course--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
certainly
was,
argued
late,
i
think
the
thing
that
may
have
deterred
from
deciding
it,
is
that
justice
department
came
in
and
said
we
must
have
a
ruling
on
the
validity
of
regulation.
we
express
no
opinion
on
the
credit
question.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
just
to
pursue
the
credit
question
once
more
in
the
legislative
hearings,
i
think
the
chairman
of
federal
trade
commission
was
asset
to
the
senate
committee.
suppose
i
hire
my
neighbor's
son
to
come
in
each
saturday
and
mow
my
lawn
and
suppose
i
agreed
to
pay
him
a
dollar
each
saturday
after
he
has
done
it.
is
that
a
credit
transaction?
and
after
a
lot
of
legal
talk,
the
answer
was
no,
there
was
no
finance
charge
and
there
was
no
credit,
so
i
understand.
that
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
normal,
healthy
example
of
an
installment
arrangement
in
which
both
sides
are
contractually
obligated
to
continue
rendering
performance
over
a
substantial
period
of
time,
but
not
a
credit
transaction,
because
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
suppose
that
the
shrewd
youngster
would
say
now
mr.
gentleman
before
i
agree
to
mow
your
lawn
and
forgo
mowing
other
people's
lawns
this
summer,
i
want
you
to
write
me
a
promise
that
you
will
pay
me
a
dollar
every
week,
i
don't
want
you
to
move
it
off
to
the
seashore
and
leaving
the
—
without
a
lawn
to
mow.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
confess
i
don't
have
a
lawn
just
about
sure.
the
analogy
to
our
case
is
i
go
to
my
news
stand
and
say
to
the,
maybe
on
safer
ground
and
say
to
my
news
dealer
i
would
like
to
get
the
manchester
guardian
on
friday.
he
says
i
am
sorry
i
will
only
get
it
for
you
if
you
will
promise
to
come
in
and
pay
me
every
friday.
i
said
sure
and
he
does
it.
now
we
are
bound,
he
may
be
bound
for
a
year
or
two
years
or
whatever
deal
i
make
for
it,
but
neither
of
us
has
extended
a
credit
to
the
other.
now,
if
he
was
a
(inaudible)
news
dealer,
as
fps
was
and
said,
look,
how
do
i
know
you
are
good
to
me,
you
pay
me
on
monday
and
i
will
have
manchester
guardian
for
you
here
on
friday,
a
fortiori,
no
credit
has
been
extended
to
the
consumer,
to
me.
by
the
contrary
i
have
extended
credit
to
the
news
dealer
and
that
is
exactly
what
happens
in
the
fps
transaction.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
contract
that
it
would
suggest
that
it
was
a
tripod
type
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
that
is
correct,
but
neither
is
the
departments
or
the
manufacturer
must
do
things
as
loyal
department
store.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
do.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
the
key
thing
though
is
that
if
the
magazine
doesn't
get
delivered
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
fps
is
liable,
not
the
magazine
publisher.
this
is
not
a
subscription
with
the
magazine
publisher,
it
is
a
subscription
with
all
the
rights
flow
from
fps
to
the
customer
and
indeed
serious
problems
have
arisen
where
for
example
the
saturday
evening
post,
or
look
magazine
closes
down.
it
is
the
pds
it
is
called,
pay
during
service
magazine
sales
organization
that
may
well
be
left
holding
the
bag,
unable
to
perform
a
contract
which
it
undertook
to
perform.
there
is
nothing
except
for
the
fact
that
it
says
delivery
will
come
from
the
publisher's
office.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
we
are
not
the
required
to
be.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
charge
customers
more
than
we
are
charged
by
the
magazine
publisher,
exactly
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
are
not
an
agent.
it
happens
that
fps
is
on
wholly
on
subsidiary
typing,
but
it
deals
in
the
magazines
of
a
lot
of
publishers
as
well
as
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
that
would
be
difficult.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
i
think
not
because
in
fact
the
arrangements
with
the
magazine
publisher
sort
of
invoke
not
just
as
i
understand
for
mrs.
mourning
but
for
some
substantial
group
whatever
came
in
that
week
and
i
don't
know
whether
she
had
a
pro-rata
interest
in
that,
may
be
as
a
member
of
class
she
does.
i
think
though
that,
go
back
to
the
manchester
guardian,
my
news
dealer
didn't
have
it
in
stock
either,
he
had
to
order
it
in
some
place
but
that
didn't
make
him
my
creditor.
similarly,
here
the
fact
that
fps
doesn't
have
the
magazine
or
the
newspaper
in
stock
doesn't
make
fps
a
bank
in
a
relationship
between
mrs.
mourning
and
holiday.
i
also
urge
that
the
court
may
feel
that
it
has
to
reach
the
credit
issue
in
all
events
here
because
assuming
that
the
government's
thesis
that
somehow
there
is
always
a
finance
charge
buried
in
credit
transactions,
assuming
that
has
any
validity
the
four
installment
rule
even
under
that
theory
could
not
logically
or
rationally
extend
to
non-credit
situations
and
if
that's
what
they
mean,
they
mean
really
to
all
installment
contract
situations
where
there
is
no
necessary
or
logical
implicit
finance
charge
then
it
means
to
me
the
rule
has
to
be
over
broad
by
all
text.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
truth
in
lending
act
is
an
important
elaborate,
a
very
complex
piece
of
social
legislation,
designed
and
indented
to
cover
an
enormous,
absolutely
enormous
array
of
consumer
credit
transactions.
in
light
of
the
complexities
involved,
congress
gave
the
federal
reserve
board
very
broad
powers
to
implement
the
purposes
of
the
act,
to
construe
it
and
to
interpret
it,
to
adopt
regulations
in
order
to
facilitate
compliance
and
so
forth.
the
four
installment
rule
is
not
an
interpretation
of
the
act.
it
is
not
a
construction
of
the
act.
it
does
not
come
under
all
those
rubrics
like
udall
and
tallman
of
a
contemporaneous
interpretation.
the
four
installment
rule
is
an
amendment
to
the
act.
it
rewrites
the
act.
it
rewrites
the
very
definitions
of
the
act
and
the
operative
provisions
of
the
act.
and
i
submit
that
because
it
brings
within
the
scope
of
the
civil
and
criminal
penalties
of
the
act,
both
of
which
can
be
quite
segregate.
it
is
invalid
because
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
explicit
language
an
intention
of
congress.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
calling
the
court's
attention
to
these
specific
statutory
provisions
on
which
we
rely.
the
portions
i
am
relying
are
set
forth
that
the
appendix
to
our
blue
brief
starting
at
the
page
1a.
first,
congress
declared
its
purpose.
it
said
that
the
informed
use
of
credit
results
from
an
awareness
of
a
cost
thereof
by
consumers
and
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
act
to
disclose
that
cost.
i
can
emphasis
too
strongly
that
what
the
act
deals
with
from
beginning
to
end
is
the
cost
of
credit,
not
the
business
costs
of
the
businessman
who
may
vary
his
charges
or
un-vary
them
but
the
cost
to
the
consumer.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
price,
the
cost.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
price
of
credit,
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement,
which
for
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
called
the
finance
charge,
a
bundled
word.
now,
they
go
on
in
the
definitions
to
define
the
term
creditor
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
act.
the
term
creditor,
it
says
in
1602
f,
refers
only
to
creditors
who
regularly
extend
or
arrange
for
the
extension
of
credit
for
which
the
payment
of
a
finance
charge
is
required.
the
provisions
of
this
sub-chapter
apply
to
any
such
creditor
irrespective
of
its
status.
so
at
the
very
outset,
the
congress
is
saying
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
creditors
who
impose
finance
charges
and
there
are
creditors
who
don't
impose
finance
charges.
we
are
talking
about
the
ones
who
did.
the
next
critical
section
or
i
should
add
at
that
point,
that
the
rewriting
of
the
act
begins
at
that
point.
the
federal
reserve
board's
definition
of
credit
omits
the
phrase,
for
which
the
payment
of
a
finance
charge
is
required.
that's
in
regulation
to
226.2
m
at
page
10a
of
our
brief.
the
next
section,
the
next
critically
operative
section
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
submit
that
the
act
does
not
distinguish
between
identified
and
unidentified
finance
charges,
hidden
or
patent
finance
charges.
it
says
finance
charges
imposed
by
a
creditor
must
in
all
circumstances
be
disclosed
without
question.
now,
i
add
the
proposition,
that
congress
did
not
share.
the
solicitor
general's
view
or
the
reserve
board's
view,
that
every
creditor
imposes
a
finance
charge
in
some
ambient
economic
sense.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
law
guarantee
that
you
are
going
to
stay
in
business
as
fois
discovered.
people
do
not
always
recover
their
cost
from
their
customers.
but
there
are
more
simple
situations.
a
patient
comes
to
a
doctor,
has
a
major
operation,
and
the
doctor
says,
well
my
fee
for
removing
your
appendix
is
$2,000,
i
know
you
can't
pay
me
for
it
now,
pay
me
$100
a
week
for
the
next
20
weeks.
no
one
in
his
right
mind,
i
think,
suppose
that
doctor
is
imposing
a
finance
charge
but
the
federal
reserve
board
says
he
is
subject
to
the
four
installment
rule.
doctor,
of
course
has
a
cost
of
business.
he
has
to
pay
his
telephone
operator,
his
nurse,
for
his
stethoscope,
and
do
whatever
doctors
do.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
oh,
i
quite
agree.
if
it
is
shown
that
the
normal
price,
this
doctor
has
been
contemporary
for
an
appendectomy
is
$1,000,
but
he
charged
$2,000
for
letting
a
patient
pay
it
for
over
two
years.
you
prove
a
finance
charge
just
simply
as
that.
and
i
--
if
the
board
wants
to
regulate
that,
i
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all,
i
think
the
act
regulates
and
requires
that
the
doctor
disclose
in
those
circumstances.
all
i
am
saying
is
that
there
are
in
fact,
in
practical
experience
as
we
all
know
situations
in
which
the
fee,
the
charge,
the
cost
imposed
on
a
customer
does
not
in
fact
vary
with
defermative
payments.
and
at
least
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
that
the
seller
experience
the
cost?
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
which
he
may
or
may
not
pass
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
which
he
may
or
may
not
realize
and
he
may
or
may
not
impose
on
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
true,
that
is
correct.
now,
i
turn
to
section
(16)
(31)
(a)
of
the
act
which
is
the
page
6(a)
of
our
appendix
in
our
brief.
and
this
is
the
general
disclosure
requirement.
it
says
that
each
creditors
,
we
have
already
defined
each
creditor
to
mean
creditors
who
regularly
impose
finance
charges.
if
such
creditor
in
accordance
with
regulations
prescribed
by
the
board
shall
disclose
to
each
person
to
whom
credit
is
extended
and
upon
whom
a
finance
charge
is
or
maybe
imposed,
the
information
required
under
this
part.
so
not
only
you
start
with
a
class
of
creditors
who
imposed
finance
charges,
you
go
on
to
those
transactions
in
which
they
in
fact
imposed
them
as
congress
has
wrote.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
about
maybe
there.
there
has
been
some
temptation
i
think,
in
the
briefs
for
the
government
and
petitioner,
suppose
that
maybe
means
maybe,
perhaps
it
is
there
and
perhaps
it
isn't.
it
clearly
doesn't
mean
that.
it
is
meant
that
word
'may'
as
defined
in
the
act
does
not
carrying
forward
into
the
code
except
the
footnote.
'may'
is
defined
as
an
act
that
is
authorized
or
permative.
in
other
words,
if
the
contract
says
you
may
defer
your
payments
and
if
you
do
so
after
the
first
30
days,
the
interest
rate
will
be
5%,
that's
a
situation
in
which
interest
--
finance
charge
maybe
imposed
pursuant
to
the
agreement.
so
to
some
conditions
it's
subsequent,
but
it
doesn't
mean
might
be
or
can't
tell
whether
it's
there
or
not.
it
doesn't
mean
maybe.
contrary
to
the
government's
--
contrary
to
the
petitioner's
suggestion
at
pages
12
and
13
of
its
brief,
the
act
does
not
impose
the
disclosure
requirements
on
all
credit
transactions,
even
of
those
who
regularly
impose
finance
charges
but
only
in
those
transactions
in
which
a
finance
charge
was
imposed.
now
the
legislative
history
behind
section
1631
shed
some
light
at
this
point.
the
senate
and
house
reports
--
the
senate
report
is
quoted
at
page
17
and
18
of
our
brief,
say
that
this
language
in
1631,
the
language
upon
whom
finance
charges
maybe
imposed
is
intended
to
make
clear
that
disclosure
need
only
be
made
to
persons
upon
whom
finance
charges
maybe
imposed.
thus
the
disclosure
requirement
would
not
apply
to
transactions
which
are
not
commonly
thought
of
as
credit
transactions,
including
trade
credit,
open
account
credit,
30,
60,
or
90
day
credit,
etcetera,
for
which
a
charge
is
not
made.
congress
didn't
have
to
say
that,
it
didn't
have
to
go
out
of
its
way
to
say
that.
it
was
briefly
simple
to
a
middle
office
language
but
it
has
reiterated
now
three
times
that
what
it's
talking
about
is
the
imposition
of
a
cost
of
credit.
finally
--
well
and
ultimately,
the
act
sets
forth,
the
disclosures
are
to
be
made,
those
are
contained
in
two
sections
in
1637,
which
sets
forth
the
disclosures
for
open
ended
credit,
charge
accounts,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
that
is
not
in
our
brief.
the
disclosures
required
there
include
the
conditions
under
which
a
finance
charge
maybe
imposed,
the
method
of
determining
the
balance
upon
which
a
finance
charge
will
be
imposed,
the
method
of
determining
the
amount
of
the
finance
charge,
and
such
like.
in
1638
which
is
the
section
applicable
if
any
is
applicable
here,
they
talked
about
the
cash
price
and
so
on.
going
on
to
the
total
amount
to
be
financed,
the
amount
of
the
finance
charge,
the
financed
charge
expressed
as
an
annual
percentage
rate
and
so
on.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
am
trying
to
show
mr.
justice
white
that
the
regulation
is
inconsistent
with
the
manifest
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
sir.
yes,
he
did.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
right.
i
might
say
in
that
connection
that
1638
demonstrates
the
quandary
created
by
imposing,
by
validating
the
four
installment
rule.
because
if
the
four
installment
rule
applies
and
you
are
required
to
make
the
disclosures,
calls
whereby
1638,
you
are
called
upon
to
make
a
disclosure
of
your
finance
charge,
and
the
annual
percentage
rate,
and
you
are
supposed
to
do
it
precisely.
no
one
has
given
us
any
clue
as
to
how
if
their
economic
theory
not
shared
by
congress
is
correct,
how
we
are
supposed
to
ascertain
it,
what
we
have
been
told
is
that
the
federal
reserve
board
doesn't
know
how
to
ascertain
it
and
that
the
whole
committee
of
homers,
who
opposed
these
regulations
didn't
know
how
to
do
it.
but
we
must
in
hundreds
of
thousands
of
transactions
each
year,
do
it
at
(inaudible)
of
a
liability
of
$100
to
every
customer
and
if
criminalized.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
federal
reserve
board
has
suggested
not
by
regulation
but
by
the
way
informally,
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
said,
well
maybe
you
don't
have
to
disclose
the
finance
charge
and
the
percentage
rate,
after
all
if
it’s
hard
to
do.
how
that
waiver
of
the
requirements
of
the
act,
furthers
the
purposes
of
the
act,
as
having
brought
within
the
ambit
of
the
act,
a
large
class
of
people
who
everyone
thought
didn't
have
finance
charges
and
then
say,
well
you
don't
have
to
disclose
your
finance
charges
after
all.
how
that
furthers
the
purpose
of
the
disclosure
of
credit
terms,
i
don't
really
see.
but
whether
or
not
the
statement
by
the
board
that
you
don't
have
to
make
those
disclosures
would
bind
mrs.
mourning
in
her
suit
or
any
of
the
other
people
who
brought
suit
or
indeed
would
bind
any
grand
jury
that
wanted
to
begin
a
criminal
proceedings
under
this
act.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
let
me
say
that--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
we
had
a
time
price
differential,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
just
a
second,
just
to
finish
with
the
act,
i
just
have
one
last
section
to
call
your
attention
to
the
act,
the
section
under
which
this
suit
actually
arise
is
1640,
finally
wraps
it
all
up
by
saying
that
if
you
violated,
if
you
failed
to
make
the
disclosures,
the
liability
imposed
is
twice
the
amount
of
the
finance
charged
in
connection
with
the
transaction.
so,
congress
apparently
thought
that
the
finance
charge
was
there
and
that
it
was
sufficiently
ascertainable
to
be
used
as
a
convenient
measuring
rod
for
the
really
penalties.
it's
not
--
it's
not
a
compensatory,
it
isn't
damage,
it's
a
penalty.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
if
you
multiply
it
by
250,000
customers
then
it
is
a
staggering
penalty.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
they
say
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
minimum
amount
of
$100
per
person,
250,000
customers
a
year
that's
$45,000,000.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
as
far
as
congress,
robinson,
harman
in
another
case
as
where
congress
left
though
the
act
clearly
didn't
apply.
let
me
go
now
to
the
--
what
you
are
raising
mr.
justice
stewart.
our
footnote
concerning
that
our
discovery
quite
late
in
the
day,
i
can
see
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
after
our
selling
operations
apparently
had
closed
down.
that
in
some
few
instances,
there
was
indication
that
some
customers
who
pay
cash
did
not
pay
the
full
price.
i
thought
candor
required
me
to
call
but
to
the
court's
attention
but
i
think
it
is
also
totally
irrelevant.
the
complaint
in
this
action,
indeed
the
second
amended
complaint
does
not
allege
that
there
was
a
finance
charge.
the
case
was
presented
in
the
district
court
on
the
plaintiff's
notion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
proposition
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
was
a
finance
charge
or
not
and
the
plaintiff
had
no
interest
in
proving
it
because
he
relied
entirely
on
regulation
z.
the
district
court
didn't
find
that
there
was
a
finance
charge,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
find
that
there
was
a
finance
charge
and
i
don't
think
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
the
plaintiff
can
now
rely
on
the
proposition
that
maybe
there
was
a
finance
charge
there.
that
isn't
the
case
that's
presented.
i
will
say
that
if
there
were
a
finance
charge
in
the
transaction,
regulation
z
is
wholly
irrelevant.
we
are
clearly
responsible
to
disclose
it
and
liable.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
to
me,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
was
not.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
district
court
said
that
the
letters
written
after
the
contract,
the
dunning
letters
written
to
mrs.
mourning,
evidenced
that,
it
was
credit
that
the
non-cancelable
provisions
of
the
contract,
the
statement
of
the
contract
was
non-cancelable,
needed
a
credit
of
transaction.
and
it's
one
of
the
ground
that
the
--
i
think
there
is
an
exemplary
of
the
grounds
he
went
on,
he
certainly
did
not
rely
on
the
proposition
that
fps,
family
publication
service
had
incurred
cost
and
paid
money
to
publishers
which
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
except
these
dunning
letters.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
he
did.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that's
a
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
he
did.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
was
no
trial.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
were
affidavits.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
only
the
dunning
letters
that
have
been
described.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
question
as
all
the
parties
here
agree.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
on
the
--
since
the
only
document
that
is
relevant,
is
an
document
that
all
of
the
parties,
i
think
concede
as
an
unambiguous
contract
and
that
is,
that
is
what
tells
you
whether
it's
a
credit
transaction
as
a
matter
of
law
or
not.
that
this
court
could
readily
proceed
to
determine
that
this
was
not
a
credit
transaction.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
does
and
i
must
say
as
i
read
some
of
the
opinions
that
have
been
issued
by
the
federal
reserve
board,
they
seem
to
be
reading
out
the
credit
requirement
of
the
act
as
well.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it's
not
the
regulation,
it's
more
the
regulation
as
applied
that
lead
to
reading
it
out
because
what
they
keep
saying
that
they
are
interested
in
is
disclosing
the
sum
total
of
installment
payments
and
they
have
gone
after
getting
the
statement
of
the
sum
of
installment
payments
to
be
disclosed
but
installment
agreements,
not
all
installment
agreements,
are
credit
agreements
and
that's
perfectly
fundamental,
and
i
think
the
federal
reserve
board
has
lost
track
of
that.
an
example
was
given
in
one
of
the
hearings
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
they
have
lost
track
of
it
in
this
case
too.
i
should
say
that
the
government
below
declined
to
take
a
position
of
whether
it
was
credit
and
expressed
no
opinion
at
all,
in
its
amicus
participation.
perhaps
that
was
why
fifth
circuit
never
reached
the
question.
i
am
not
quite
clear
what
position
i
take
on
the
credit
question
here,
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear,
if
you
look
at
the
opinions,
opinion
letters
that
the
board
has
issued
that
they
are
reading
out
diminishing
the
requirement
of
credit
in
these
installment
contracts.
now
that's
the
underlying
rationale
of
what
they
are
trying
to
do
here.
they
keep
telling
us,
you
don't
have
to
disclose
the
finance
charge
that
would
be
too
hard.
but
what
you
have
to
disclose
is
the
sum
total
of
installment
payments.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
we
were
cross
motions
for
summary
judgments.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that's
right,
that
seems
to
me
that
the
contract
on
its
base
is
really
the
answer
to
whether
or
not
it
is,
that's
what
the
district
judge
thought
too,
he
said
the
acceleration
cost,
their
brand,
i
have
forgotten,
the
non-cancel
of
the
provision
and
perhaps
also
the
dunning
letters,
came
together
to
support
that
conclusion.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
i
don't
think
so--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
would
think
that
when
i
go
to
buy
a
car
on
time
from
general
motors'
dealer,
it
really
whether
my
relationship
with
him
is
a
credit
relationship,
doesn't
depend
upon
whether
he
has
already
bought
the
car
from
general
motors
and
he
has
been
holding
it
or
he
plans
to
buy
in
the
future
from
general
motors.
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is,
is
he
extending
the
credit,
not
what
he
is
doing
with
his
money,
how
he
raises
his
money.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
buyer
is
extending
credit
to
the
publisher
that
is
exactly
what
is
happening
here.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
the
district
court
didn't
hear--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
our
answer
to
the
complaint
did
say
at
no
point
during
the
life
of
the
contract
has
defended,
that's
fps
paid
money
to
a
third
person
or
supplied
goods
or
services
to
the
customer
for
which
reimbursement
is
expected
from
the
customer
in
the
future.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
paid
magazine
publishers
after
we
received
payment
from
the
customer,
and
that
is
not
clearly
established
in
the
record,
but
district
court
thought
it
was
irrelevant,
and
not
necessary
to
its
conclusion,
and
i
think
the
grounds
on
which
the
district
court
relied
are
legal
error.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
one
of
the
reasons
for
acceleration
clause
is
precisely
that
we
did
not
care
to
become
creditors;
we
wanted
to
be
paid
in
advance.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
were
willing
to
be
paid
at
sort
of
double
the
rate
--
but
if
they
fell
into
the
pot
we
wanted
the
whole
amount
in
advance
but
we
didn't
want
to
be
sending
magazines
to
people
who
had
not
paid
us.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes
we
would
be
substantially
in
mrs.
mournings'
debts.
she
would
have
paid
us
$122,
three
magazines.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
in
the
original
contract,
it
says--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
if
it's
credit
running
from
mrs.
mourning
to
us
the
act
doesn't
apply
because
it
only
applies
the
other
way
around.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
the
answer
is
it
applies
only
to
consumers.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
that
on
this
record,
it
will
at
least
to
be
remanded
to
the
fifth
circuit
to
consider
the
question.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
difference
between
affirming
with
the
fifth
circuit
on
another
ground
that
it
didn't
reach
and
reversing
it
on
a
ground
that
it
didn't
consider.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
it
would
be
more
conformable
to
the
normal
practice
of
the
court
in
those
circumstances
to
remand
it
to
fifth
circuit
and
that
may
be
in
the
last
analysis
you
have
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
for
an
evidentiary
examination
of
the
question.if
i
am
right
then
you
can
answer
the
question
on
the
face
of
the
contract,
it
seems
to
be,
it
can
be
answered
here
as
well
as
in
the
other
court.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
could
see
the
court
saying
that
it
ought
to
reach
the
credit
argument
first,
i
think
it
was
thrown
off
that
normal
course--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
it
certainly
was,
argued
late,
i
think
the
thing
that
may
have
deterred
from
deciding
it,
is
that
justice
department
came
in
and
said
we
must
have
a
ruling
on
the
validity
of
regulation.
we
express
no
opinion
on
the
credit
question.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
just
to
pursue
the
credit
question
once
more
in
the
legislative
hearings,
i
think
the
chairman
of
federal
trade
commission
was
asset
to
the
senate
committee.
suppose
i
hire
my
neighbor's
son
to
come
in
each
saturday
and
mow
my
lawn
and
suppose
i
agreed
to
pay
him
a
dollar
each
saturday
after
he
has
done
it.
is
that
a
credit
transaction?
and
after
a
lot
of
legal
talk,
the
answer
was
no,
there
was
no
finance
charge
and
there
was
no
credit,
so
i
understand.
that
seems
to
me
a
perfectly
normal,
healthy
example
of
an
installment
arrangement
in
which
both
sides
are
contractually
obligated
to
continue
rendering
performance
over
a
substantial
period
of
time,
but
not
a
credit
transaction,
because
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well
i
suppose
that
the
shrewd
youngster
would
say
now
mr.
gentleman
before
i
agree
to
mow
your
lawn
and
forgo
mowing
other
people's
lawns
this
summer,
i
want
you
to
write
me
a
promise
that
you
will
pay
me
a
dollar
every
week,
i
don't
want
you
to
move
it
off
to
the
seashore
and
leaving
the
—
without
a
lawn
to
mow.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
confess
i
don't
have
a
lawn
just
about
sure.
the
analogy
to
our
case
is
i
go
to
my
news
stand
and
say
to
the,
maybe
on
safer
ground
and
say
to
my
news
dealer
i
would
like
to
get
the
manchester
guardian
on
friday.
he
says
i
am
sorry
i
will
only
get
it
for
you
if
you
will
promise
to
come
in
and
pay
me
every
friday.
i
said
sure
and
he
does
it.
now
we
are
bound,
he
may
be
bound
for
a
year
or
two
years
or
whatever
deal
i
make
for
it,
but
neither
of
us
has
extended
a
credit
to
the
other.
now,
if
he
was
a
(inaudible)
news
dealer,
as
fps
was
and
said,
look,
how
do
i
know
you
are
good
to
me,
you
pay
me
on
monday
and
i
will
have
manchester
guardian
for
you
here
on
friday,
a
fortiori,
no
credit
has
been
extended
to
the
consumer,
to
me.
by
the
contrary
i
have
extended
credit
to
the
news
dealer
and
that
is
exactly
what
happens
in
the
fps
transaction.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
contract
that
it
would
suggest
that
it
was
a
tripod
type
--
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes,
that
is
correct,
but
neither
is
the
departments
or
the
manufacturer
must
do
things
as
loyal
department
store.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
they
do.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
i
think
the
key
thing
though
is
that
if
the
magazine
doesn't
get
delivered
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
fps
is
liable,
not
the
magazine
publisher.
this
is
not
a
subscription
with
the
magazine
publisher,
it
is
a
subscription
with
all
the
rights
flow
from
fps
to
the
customer
and
indeed
serious
problems
have
arisen
where
for
example
the
saturday
evening
post,
or
look
magazine
closes
down.
it
is
the
pds
it
is
called,
pay
during
service
magazine
sales
organization
that
may
well
be
left
holding
the
bag,
unable
to
perform
a
contract
which
it
undertook
to
perform.
there
is
nothing
except
for
the
fact
that
it
says
delivery
will
come
from
the
publisher's
office.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
no
we
are
not
the
required
to
be.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
charge
customers
more
than
we
are
charged
by
the
magazine
publisher,
exactly
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
we
are
not
an
agent.
it
happens
that
fps
is
on
wholly
on
subsidiary
typing,
but
it
deals
in
the
magazines
of
a
lot
of
publishers
as
well
as
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
well,
i
think
that
would
be
difficult.
mr.
robert
s.
rifkind
yes.
i
think
not
because
in
fact
the
arrangements
with
the
magazine
publisher
sort
of
invoke
not
just
as
i
understand
for
mrs.
mourning
but
for
some
substantial
group
whatever
came
in
that
week
and
i
don't
know
whether
she
had
a
pro-rata
interest
in
that,
may
be
as
a
member
of
class
she
does.
i
think
though
that,
go
back
to
the
manchester
guardian,
my
news
dealer
didn't
have
it
in
stock
either,
he
had
to
order
it
in
some
place
but
that
didn't
make
him
my
creditor.
similarly,
here
the
fact
that
fps
doesn't
have
the
magazine
or
the
newspaper
in
stock
doesn't
make
fps
a
bank
in
a
relationship
between
mrs.
mourning
and
holiday.
i
also
urge
that
the
court
may
feel
that
it
has
to
reach
the
credit
issue
in
all
events
here
because
assuming
that
the
government's
thesis
that
somehow
there
is
always
a
finance
charge
buried
in
credit
transactions,
assuming
that
has
any
validity
the
four
installment
rule
even
under
that
theory
could
not
logically
or
rationally
extend
to
non-credit
situations
and
if
that's
what
they
mean,
they
mean
really
to
all
installment
contract
situations
where
there
is
no
necessary
or
logical
implicit
finance
charge
then
it
means
to
me
the
rule
has
to
be
over
broad
by
all
text.
thank
you
very
much.
