mr.
matthew
j.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
the
case
involves
principally
the
question
of
whether
a
state
may
arrest
and
convict
petitioners
of
trespass
where
they
sat
at
a
white
lunch
counter
in
a
business
open
to
the
general
public
and
where
a
city
ordinance
required
the
policy
of
excluding
negroes
to
be
enforced.
but
the
city
of
greenville,
south
carolina
has
an
ordinance
which
is
codified
as
section
31-8
of
the
code
of
the
city
of
greenville
and
which
is
reproduced
in
our
brief
at
pages
2
and
3
and
is
in
the
record
at
page
49
which
provides
that
any
person
--
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
owning,
managing
or
controlling
any
hotel,
restaurant,
café,
eating
house,
boarding
house,
or
similar
establishment
to
furnish
meals
to
white
persons
and
colored
persons
in
the
same
room,
at
the
same
table,
or
at
the
same
counter.
and
providing,
however,
that
meals
may
be
served
to
white
persons
and
colored
persons
in
the
same
room
where
separate
facilities
are
furnished.
the
ordinance
then
proceeds
to
describe
the
manner
in
which
the
facility
shall
be
made
separate.
s.h.
kress
and
company
is
a
large
nationwide
chain
and
it
has
a
store
in
greenville,
south
carolina
which
caters
to
the
general
public
including
negroes
and
the
sale
of
more
than
10,000
items.
however,
kress'
as
is
--
in
the
case
and
other
localities
also
has
a
food
counter
from
which
it
excludes
negroes
in
obedience
to
local
custom
and
in
further
obedience
to
the
ordinance
to
which
we
have
just
referred.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that's
correct
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it's
a
lunch
counter.
it's
not
a
separate
restaurant
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it's
not
a
separately
enclosed
restaurant,
it's
a
lunch
counter
which
has
about
59
stools
or
seats
placed
adjacent
to
the
counter.
now,
the
custom
to
which
i
have
just
referred
will
be
discussed
later
in
this
presentation.
on
august
9,
1960,
about
14
young
negro
citizens
went
into
a
kress
store
in
greenville,
south
carolina
and
seated
themselves
at
the
lunch
counter.
they
seated
themselves
there
and
very
shortly
thereafter,
captain
bramlett
of
the
greenville
city
police
department
received
a
call
by
way
of
the
radio
at
his
police
headquarters
that
there
was
--
there
were
some
young
colored
boys
and
girls
seated
at
the
lunch
counter
around
the
kress'.
this
was
the
message
that
he
received
and
according
to
the
--
to
his
testimony,
it
was
upon
this
--
receipt
of
this
information
that
he
and
other
officers
proceeded
to
the
kress
premises.
when
he
arrived
at
the
kress
premises,
he
and
the
officer
who
rode
with
him
met
some
other
officers
on
the
outside
of
kress'
and
together,
they
went
into
the
rear
door
and
they
found
the
young
colored
boys
and
girls
seated
at
the
lunch
counter.
the
lunch
counter
here
is
situated
just
inside
the
rear
door
and
of
course,
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
store,
they
saw
the
young
negroes
seated
at
--
sitting
at
the
counter.
now,
there
was
captain
bramlett
and
another
patrolman
from
his
office
and
when
they
arrived
there,
they
found
officer
ohilia
(ph)
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
agency
also
present
and
a
number
of
other
officers
were
in
and
about
the
premises.
officer
ohilia
(ph),
a
member
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
agency
later
testified
that
he
works
directly
under
chief
strom
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division
who
likewise
or
who
also
works
under
governor
hollings,
the
governor
of
the
state
is
the
chief
officer
then
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division.
and
the
testimony
is
that
the
presence
of
officer
ohilia
(ph)
on
these
premises
was
for
the
purpose
of
giving
assistance
to
the
local
police.
but
he
also
testified
that
his
presence
in
any
situation
more
or
less
reflected
the
attitude
of
the
officer
or
the
governor.
these
young
people
were
told
later
that
the
lunch
counter
was
closed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
captain
bramlett
of
the
police
department
testified
that
shortly
after
his
arrival,
he
heard
manager
g.w.
west,
the
manager,
the
local
manager
of
kress'
state
to
everyone
that
the
lunch
counter
is
closing.
that
manager
west
then
turned
the
lights
out
over
the
lunch
counter
and
that
thereafter
when
the
young
negroes
refused
to
leave,
he,
captain
bramlett
announced
to
all
of
them
that
they
were
under
arrest.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
was
nothing
further
said
to
them
by
the
manager.
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
they
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct
sir.
the
petitioners
merely
declined
to
move.
and
the
testimony
was
that
they
sat
there
for
a
total
of
about
five
minutes
and
that
captain
bramlett
and
the
other
officers
escorted
them
out
and
placed
them
under
arrest.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
evidence
is
that
only
the
negro
petitioners
were
arrested.
however,
there
is
also
evidence
that
some
white
persons
remained
seated
after
the
lunch
counter
was
closed.
now,
mr.
west,
the
store
manager
stated
that
the
white
persons
left
also.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
this
was
his
testimony.
of
course,
the
--
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
which
contradicts
the
testimony
of
mr.
west
on
that
point.
other
witnesses
testified
that
white
persons
kept
their
seats.
they
remained
seated
and
that
of
course
only
the
negro
petitioners
were
arrested.
four
of
the
young
people
who
were
arrested
were
under
the
age
of
16
and
their
cases
were
referred
to
the
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
court
of
greenville
county.
the
persons
who
were
tried
in
the
municipal
court
of
the
city
of
greenville
were
found
guilty
of
trespass
and
were
given
sentences
of
$100
or
30
days.
their
convictions
were
later
upheld
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
the
record
here
clearly
shows
state
action
which
was
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
should
like
to
state
the
items
upon
which
we
rely
as
constituting
state
action
in
this
matter.
first
of
all,
there
is
a
statewide
custom
of
racial
segregation
which
is
generated
by
state
law.
south
carolina
schools
are
segregated
all
the
way
from
the
elementary
schools
through
to
the
college
and
university
stage.
negroes
and
whites
may
not
work
together
in
the
same
room
in
textile
industries.
circuses
and
travelling
shows
must
provide
separate
accommodations
for
spectators.
persons
serving
in
prisons
and
chain
gangs
are
required
by
south
carolina
law
to
be
segregated.
steam
ferries
and
railroad
cars
are
required
by
law
to
provide
separate
facilities
for
whites
and
negroes.
station
restaurants
must
provide
racially
separate
facilities.
street
cars
are
required
by
law
to
do
the
same
thing
it
is
a
crime
in
south
carolina
to
give
a
white
child
to
a
negro.
intermarriage
between
the
races
is
prohibited.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
to
give
a
white
child
to
a
negro.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
to
give
custody
of
a
white
child
to
a
negro.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
of
course,
the
statute
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
and
we
respectfully
call
the
court's
attention
to
that
statute.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no
sir,
it
does
not
cover
the
babysitter
area.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
of
course
in
south
carolina
there
is
a
specific
statute
which
goes
beyond
the
--
any
general
law
which
covers
this
situation
by
further
making
it
crime
to
give
a
white
child
to
a
negro
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
intermarriage
between
the
races
is
prohibited.
all
south
carolina
parks
are
segregated
by
law.
the
city
of
greenville,
south
carolina
has
an
ordinance
requiring
racial
segregation
and
that
is
in
residential
areas.
and
of
course,
lastly
but
not
the
least,
there
is
section
31-8
of
the
code
of
greenville
which
requires
segregation
in
eating
establishments.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
packets
of
legislation
which
requires
segregation
in
south
carolina
parks
is
now
the
subject
of
litigation
pending
in
the
eastern
district
of
south
carolina.
the
city
of
greenville's
ordinance
which
requires
residential
segregation
is
likewise
the
subject
of
both
a
civil
action
designed
to
have
it
declared
unconstitutional.
and
also
one
or
more
persons
have
been
arrested
under
its
penal
provisions
and
appeals
from
the
convictions
which
were
obtained
under
this
ordinance
are
now
pending
in
south
carolina
state
courts.
as
to
the
other
clause,
which
are
under
question,
of
course
the
court
is
aware
of
the
decision
which
accompanied
this
court's
rules
--
ruling
in
brown
versus
board
of
education,
one
of
the
cases
was
called
briggs
versus
elliott
which
came
from
south
carolina
and
declared
south
carolina's
constitutional
provisions
which
required
racial
segregation
unconstitutional.
however,
the
constitutional
provision
itself
nor
the
statutory
provisions
which
were
enacted
pursuant
to
this
constitutional
provision
have
been
repealed
so
the
laws
are
still
outstanding
on
the
books
and
in
fact
schools
are
still
segregated.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
100%,
that's
correct.
litigation
is
now
pending
on
that
particular
subject
in
south
carolina.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
one
phase
of
it
is
now
pending
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
no
sir.
since
that
time,
a
new
case
has
been
filed
by
reason
of
certain
reorganizations
of
school
districts
in
clarendon
county.
the
name
of
that
suit
is
brunson
versus
board
of
trustees
of
clarendon
county
and
the
phase
of
that
litigation
is
now
pending
in
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
believe
that
that
would
cover
the
court
decisions
which
have
been
made
with
reference
to
the
laws
which
i
have
mentioned
and
the
litigation
which
is
now
pending
in
reference
to
them.
another
item
of
state
action
that
we
rely
upon
in
this
matter
is
that
the
independent
action
by
the
police
in
this
matter
in
arresting
the
petitioners
when
their
only
crime
was
sitting
at
a
white
lunch
counter
was
a
state
action
which
we
think
was
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
lastly,
the
conviction
of
these
petitioners
and
their
sentencing
in
south
carolina
state
courts.
the
petitioners
were
--
of
course,
were
convicted
of
the
crime
of
trespass
and
of
course
this
statute
is
set
forth
in
petitioner's
brief
at
page
2.
so
that
the
evidence
is
that
though
petitioners
were
convicted
of
the
crime
of
trespass
--
in
the
name
of
the
crime
of
trespass,
they
were
in
fact
convicted
of
violating
the
segregation
policy
of
the
city
of
greenville
and
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
as
is
reflected
by
the
ordinance
which
makes
it
a
crime
for
white
persons
and
negroes
to
be
given
food
accommodations
in
the
same
room
unless
those
provisions
are
settled.
if,
as
the
manager
testified,
h.s.
kress
and
company
maintained
the
policy
of
segregation
because
of
the
ordinance,
then
there
could
be
no
other
conclusion
than
that
the
city
by
the
ordinance
and
by
arrest
and
criminal
conviction
has
placed
its
authority
behind
discriminatory
treatment
based
solely
on
color
and
we
respectfully
say
that
this
is
precisely
what
the
record
shows.
the
manager
testified
at
page
23
in
the
record
in
response
to
a
question
which
was
posed
to
him
on
cross-examination.
“mr.
west,
why
did
you
order
your
lunch
counter
closed?”
his
answer
was,
“it's
contrary
to
local
customs
and
it's
also
the
ordinance
that
has
been
discussed.”
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
is
quite
a
discussion
on
it
which
appears
on
pages
10
and
11
of
the
record
in
the
cross-examination
of
captain
bramlett
of
the
greenville
city
police
department.
the
question,
“does
greenville
have
an
ordinance
against
conduct
of
this
sort?”
his
answer
was,
“we
do.”
and
over
on
page
11,
“what
is
that
law
that
police
served?”
answer
-
“it
forbids
colored
and
the
white
eating
at
the
same
lunch
counter.”
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
is
necessary
in
our
procedure.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
is
necessary
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
but
the
court
excluded
this
item
of
evidence
under
the
theory
that
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues
before
the
court.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
at
the
--
it
appears
a
number
of
places
in
the
record.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
very
good,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
alright,
that's
very
good
sir.
it
was
mentioned
on
pages
10
and
11,
however
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
--
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
an
offer
was
made
and
of
course
the
court
ruled
this
line
of
evidence
out.
perhaps
later
in
my
discussion
i
can
refer
the
court
to
the
exact
page.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that's
a
misprint,
31-8
as
amended.
now,
these
petitioners'
arrests
and
convictions
then
result
directly
from
the
segregation
command
of
the
city
of
greenville
and
not
from
any
individual
or
corporate
business
decision
or
preference
of
the
management
to
exclude
negroes
from
the
lunch
counter.
the
city
of
greenville
determined
that
the
petitioners'
conduct
would
be
unlawful
even
if
the
department
store
consented
to
serve
them
at
the
lunch
counter.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
lunch
counter
at
kress'
is
still
segregated
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
policy
still
prevails
throughout
the
greenville
community.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
in
greenville
or
in
south
carolina?
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
in
columbia,
south
carolina,
there
are
several
stores
including
the
kress
store
located
in
columbia.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
are
none.
so
our
contention
is
that
by
enacting
first
that
persons
who
remain
in
a
restaurant
when
the
owner
demands
that
they
leave
are
trespassers
and
then
enacting
that
restaurants
may
not
permit
negroes
to
remain
in
white
restaurants,
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
the
city
of
greenville
have
made
it
a
crime,
that
is
the
crime
of
trespass
for
a
negro
to
remain
in
a
white
restaurant.
and
we
respectfully
say
that
this
contravenes
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
has
been
so
held
in
a
number
of
cases
by
this
court.
may
i
save
the
rest
of
time
please.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
snyder
in
his
remarks
on
yesterday
referred
to
the
innkeeper
doctrine
and
stated
that
the
innkeeper
doctrine
was
not
applicable
in
this
situation.
we
respectfully
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
in
the
city
of
greenville,
south
carolina,
a
negro
traveling
through
the
city
of
greenville
or
in
the
city
of
greenville
on
business
or
for
whatever
his
purpose
might
be
cannot
obtain
a
meal
on
main
street
in
the
city
of
greenville.
and
this
policy
or
custom
is
generated
by
state
law
and
most
especially
by
the
ordinance
which
the
store
manager
in
this
case
testified
he
was
acting
upon.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
are
a
few
restaurants
which
cater
only
to
negroes.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
contend
that
it
is
mr.
justice
harlan
and
as
i
understood
the
remarks
of
mr.
snyder
on
yesterday,
the
city
of
greenville
concede
that
it
is
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
matthew

there
have
been
many
contentions
in
this
particular
regard
that
a
whiteman
would
be
so
arrested.
but
a
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
not
to
my
knowledge.
not
in
--
not
in
the
whole
state
of
south
carolina.
i
believe
of
course
as
these
cases
will
demonstrate,
the
demonstrations
in
some
of
the
other
cases
involved
interracial
groups.
but
none
of
the
demonstrations
in
south
carolina
which
involved,
i
believe,
more
than
1200
young
people
involved
interracial
groups.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
a
number
of
them
are
still
awaiting
trial,
i
would
not
have
a
guess
as
to
the
exact
number,
but
i
think
that
i
can
answer
your
question
sir
by
stating
that
more
than
1200
young
people
were
arrested.
and
this
case
of
course
was
set
down
for
hearing.
there
are
a
number
of
other
the
cases
in
which
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari
are
now
pending
and
a
number
of
cases
are
still
to
be
argued
before
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
i
believe
on
next
week,
we
have
some
nine
cases
set
down
for
argument
in
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
some
of
them
have
not
yet
been
tried.
they
seemed
to
be
awaiting
the
outcome
of
this
class
of
litigation
before
this
court.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir.
i
did
not
say
that.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you
sir.
mr.
snyder
says
here
that
the
ordinance
in
this
case
did
not
punish
the
petitioners
but
was
--
would
punish
the
manager
had
the
manager
sought
to
serve
both
whites
and
negroes?
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
may
we
answer
that
by
pointing
out
that
the
ordinance
in
this
case
was
not
a
mere
(inaudible)
abstract
exhortation
to
the
manager
but
was
obligatory
in
its
terms.
and
the
manager
was
left
without
a
choice
and
acted
in
asking
these
petitioners
to
leave
his
premises
according
to
his
testimony
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
snyder
said
on
yesterday
that
textile
mills
are
not
acting
in
accordance
with
the
state's
statute
which
prohibits
the
employment
of
whites
and
negroes
in
the
same
room
at
the
same
time.
in
answer
to
that,
may
we
point
out
that
the
statute
is
still
in
effect
on
the
books
in
south
carolina
and
where
we
permitted
to
go
outside
the
record
in
this
case,
we
can
prove
that
the
statute
is
still
followed
although
with
the
state
of
south
carolina.
we
understand
however,
that
i
may
not
make
such
a
comment.
mr.
snyder
pointed
out
in
his
remarks
on
yesterday
that
the
greenville
airport
in
greenville,
south
carolina
is
desegregated.
may
we
comment
on
that
in
the
following
manner?
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
required
the
greenville
airport
commission
to
desegregate
that
airport
and
the
same
counsel
in
this
case
before
this
court
today
were
counsel
in
that
case.
mr.
snyder
has
alluded
to
what
he
believes
to
be
the
primary
issue
in
this
case,
namely,
whether
the
proprietor
of
a
business
establishment
has
the
right
to
select
his
customers
on
the
ground
of
race.
we
respectfully
say
that
whatever
right
of
personal
choice
a
proprietor
has
to
make
personal
distinctions,
the
limits
of
that
privilege
certainly
seems
to
be
reached
when
the
person
exercising
it
turns
to
the
state
for
assistance.
this
seems
to
be
what
happened
in
this
case.
the
store
manager
acting
not
upon
his
personal
choice
but
upon
the
mandate
or
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
the
city
of
greenville
and
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
following
its
broad
plan
of
keeping
the
races
separated
in
every
area
of
life
in
south
carolina
chose
to
tell
this
man
to
segregate
white
and
negroes
seeking
to
eat
in
the
premises
of
his
business.
in
shelley
against
kraemer,
this
court
said,
the
constitution
confers
upon
no
individual
the
right
to
demand
action
by
the
state
which
results
in
the
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
other
individuals.
we
respectfully
say
to
this
court
that
this
is
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
that
whatever
right
of
personal
choice
the
manager
of
kress'
had
in
this
case,
he
did
not
use
it.
he
turned
to
the
state
to
enforce
it's
--
the
state's
policy
of
racial
segregation.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
suggest
respectfully
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
that
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
--
manager
didn't
want
them
there.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
believe
that
sir
the
constitution
would
not
confer
upon
him
the
right
to
–
to
demand
that
the
state
action
which
would
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
certainly
would
not
go
that
far
sir.
but
in
a
case
like
this
one
where
the
manager
of
kress',
the
kress
company
has
opened
its
entire
premises
to
the
public
and
has
said
to
the
public,
“come
one,
come
all.
we
have
for
sale
here
more
than
10,000
items,
hue,
white,
black,
red,
and
yellow
are
invited
to
come
here
and
purchase”.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
but
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
would
not
go
that
far
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
