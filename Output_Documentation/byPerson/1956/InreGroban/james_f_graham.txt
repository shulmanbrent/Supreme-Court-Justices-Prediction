mr.
james
f.
graham
if
it
please
this
honorable
court.
on
january
the
22nd,
1954,
a
fire
occurred
on
the
premises
of
the
dresden
woolen
mills,
which
is
located
in
the
village
of
dresden,
muskingum
county,
state
of
ohio.
almost
immediately
following
this
fire,
the
state
fire
marshal,
pursuant
to
the
chapter
37
of
the
revised
code
of
ohio,
commenced
his
investigation.
and
under
the
powers
of
that
investigation,
subpoenaing
to
columbus,
the
owners
and
proprietors
of
the
dresden
woolen
mills,
mr.
harry
and
nathan
groban,
who
are
the
petitioners
and
the
appellants
in
this
matter.
at
the
appearance
in
columbus
before
the
state
fire
marshal,
the
fire
marshal
read
to
the
petitioners
revised
code
section
3737.13
which
is
cited
in
our
appendix,
declaring
a
hearing
to
be
private.
that
our
--
the
counsels
or
myself
and
my
father's
advice,
the
appellants
at
that
time
requested
to
be
with
counsel.
this
was
the
denied.
therefore,
the
petitioners-appellants
refused
to
be
sworn
and
refused
to
be
testified.
and
at
that
time,
under
the
powers
granted
to
the
fire
marshal,
the
fire
marshal
committed
them
although
technically,
they
were
committed.
we
immediately
filed
our
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
common
pleas
court
on
march
the
1st,
the
same
day
of
the
hearing
and
proceeded
in
this
matter.
these
are
the
facts.
they're
outlined
in
our
brief,
the
appellant's
brief.
i
would
like
to
add
to
that
or
supplement
those
facts
with
additional
facts
in
view
of
the
appellees'
answer
brief
thereto
with
a
copy
of
which
my
father
and
i
received
last
week
and
did
not
receive
a
printed
copy
until
yesterday
morning.
in
the
answer
brief,
they
point
out
that
that
there
was
no
actual
incarceration.
that
was
at
page
1
of
the
appellees'
brief.
they
spoke
of
an
open
hearing
on
the
right
of
counsel
at
page
5.
they
speak
of
abrogated
power
of
an
investigator
on
page
7.
these
facts
i
feel
will
explain
some
of
these
various
points
that
are
mentioned
in
the
appellees'
brief.
at
the
time
--
at
the
first
instance
of
the
investigation
by
the
fire
marshal,
the
assistant
fire
marshal,
willis
s.
peterson
was
accompanied
by
a
mr.
donahue
who
was
a
representative
of
the
national
underwriters
--
adjusters
rather
which,
in
short,
the
appellant's
building.
it
was
stated
to
the
appellants
at
that
instance
that
the
amount
of
fire
loss
claim
would
be
a
factor
in
determining
one
of
the
crime
of
arson,
has
been
committed.
on
that
particular
day,
they
appeared
--
mr.
peterson
appeared
with
a
tape
recorder
and
accompanied
by
mr.
donahue.
he
advised
the
appellants
that
they
were
to
commence
to
testify
and
it
were
to
be
taken
down
on
this
recorder.
at
that
instance,
they
phoned
our
office.
my
father
who
had
represented
the
company
for
a
number
of
years
was
out
of
the
city
and
could
not
be
reached.
i
myself
took
the
phone
call,
and
at
that
instance,
was
advised
by
mr.
peterson
of
the
specific,
section
3737.13,
where
he
claimed
he
had
the
power
to
exclude
counsel.
after
briefly
talking
to
him,
i
said
that
i
would
have
to
educate
myself
a
little
farther
in
the
matter
and
i
would
like
to
call
him
back
within
a
half
an
hour.
i
did
that
and
at
that
instance,
i
advised
him
that
although
i
had
read
the
attorney
general's
opinion
that
is
cited
by
judge
clifford
in
the
common
pleas
court
and
is
to
a
transcript
to
this
record
and
referred
to
and
relied
to
in
that
opinion,
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
it
was
not
a
constitutional
deprivation
of
due
process
to
exclude
counsel
in
a
hearing
of
this
nature
when
he
had
been
given
so
many
other
powers
by
our
legislature.
at
that
instance,
the
fire
marshal,
assistant
fire
marshal
became
incensed
and
advised
me
by
--
on
the
phone
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
hearing
in
columbus,
subpoenaing
these
men,
where
this
--
subpoena
a
different
station,
bringing
all
of
their
records
of
all
the
company
to
columbus,
and
at
that
time,
they'd
had
no
right
of
counsel.
i
say
this
for
the
very
minute
i
might
have,
although,
all
of
these
facts
are
not
in
the
actual
record.
it
must
be
assumed
and
can
be
supposed
in
this
instance
that
such
are
the
facts
in
this
record
because
with
a
layman
with
this
power,
i
submit
that
such
could
be
the
case
at
any
instance.
if
a
man
has
this
power
with
no
limitations,
personalities
can
become
involved.
mr.
james
f.
graham
we
have,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
no,
your
honor.
it
becomes
secret,
but
i
think
there
is
a
very
distinct
difference
between
a
grand
jury
who
does
not
--
is
not
paid,
it
is
not
their
duty.
they
are
his
peers
or
his
equals,
15
in
number.
there
is
safety
in
numbers
for
personalities.
they
are
not
there
to
--
to
see
that
the
person
is
with
one
particular
goal.
they
are
individuals
that
have
no
--
are
not
paid
by
the
state
for
an
accomplished
purpose.
i
think
that
is
the
--
the
distinction
and
the
secrecy
there
that
--
that
they
are
enclosed
is
because
the
public
in
general
i
think
when
they
are
called
upon
to
pass
upon
their
fellowmen
are
not
required
to
have
knowledge
as
to
--
to
be
notarized
as
having
put
the
accusation
or
point
a
finger
to
one
of
their
fellowmen.
i
think
the
underlying
theory
of
the
grand
jury
is
entirely
different
than
it
is
to
an
investigator
in
a
crime
of
appellant.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right,
your
honor.
if
--
if
the
grand
jury
indicts
then
it
goes
through
under
the
--
they
commenced
the
proceedings
to
the
trial.
the
actual
step
here
is
one
step
removed.
actually,
i
assumed
that
in
the
instance
that
the
fire
marshal
in
this
case,
if
he
had
enough
evidence,
although
he
can
arrest
and
has
the
power
of
arrest
in
the
3737.10
of
the
revised
code,
they
would
still
have
to
indict
him
to
the
grand
jury
in
the
state
of
ohio.
nevertheless,
i
feel
that
the
harm
is
done
in
so
many
of
an
--
an
investigation
where
the
man
has
the
power
of
subpoenaing.
and
then
on
top
of
that,
has
the
power
to
arrest
in
a
closed
hearing
where
the
--
the
records,
the
--
the
law
does
not
prescribe
that
every
word
is
transcribed.
it
says
that
the
testimony
shall
be
required
or
submitted
or
reduced
to
writing.
well,
that's
a
little
bit
different,
i
believe
than
a
--
ordering
that
the
hearing
must
have
a
court
reporter
or
somebody
that
transcribes
the
whole
hearing.
i
--
i
feel
that
in
this
particular
instance
and
i
think
it
will
also
must
be
a
supposition
that
if
personalities
become
involved,
i
would
venture
to
say
that
there
would
be
a
record
that
would
not
be
often
a
true
record.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right.
that
is
directly
the
sections
that
you're
referring
to,
revised
code
3737.10
and
.99
which
are
identical
or
almost
identical
with
the
sections
of
the
michigan
statute
that
are
attached
as
appendix
b
to
our
brief
and
are
--
now
came
before
this
honorable
court,
in
the
murchison
and
in
the
in
re
oliver
cases.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right,
your
honor.
you
see,
i
feel
before
the
murchison
and
oliver
cases
will
become
directly
in
point
in
controlling
on
all
force.
we
would
have
had
the
petitioners
in
this
instance
sworn
and
then
as
becoming
recalcitrant
or
being
obstinate,
have
been
found
in
contempt
by
the
court
and
summarily
committed,
and
then
we
would
have
raised
that
enough
where
you
had
--
then
question
those
particular
statutes
before
this
supreme
court
of
ohio,
i
think
then
those
particular
sections
would
be
directly
before
this
court.
my
--
my
contention
is
held
throughout
this
brief.
is
it
--
you
cannot
disregard
the
in
re
murchison
and
in
re
oliver
findings,
but
they
are
enlightening
in
showing
the
power
that
has
been
granted
by
the
ohio
legislature.
and
--
and
i
believe
in
the
in
re
murchison
case,
this
court
stated
that
a
state
court
can
delegate
their
administrative
and
investigatory
duties
to
a
member
of
the
judiciary
when
they
spoke
of
the
one-man
grand
jury,
but
this
is
not
a
member
of
the
judiciary.
this
is
a
layman.
mr.
james
f.
graham
your
honor,
i
have
not.
i
have
--
i
have
been
unable
to
find
a
case
that
i
can
cite
to
this
honorable
court
that
is
specifically
in
point.
i
am
relying
on
the
--
the
change
in
our
system
of
jurist
--
jurisprudence
of
our
administrative
law,
the
days
when
the
--
the
investigation
and
investigators,
the
notoriety
which
they
have
--
have
assumed
in
some
investigations
were
in
the
notoriety
and
in
of
itself
as
the
tier
from
the
ultimate
goal
that
that
is
sufficient
to
show
that
there
is
a
change
in
our
time
sufficient
to
guarantee
a
man
or
give
a
man
the
right
of
counsel
before
an
investigator
who
had
these
powers.
mr.
james
f.
graham
your
honor,
i
was
not
as
well
educated
at
the
time
at
the
--
at
--
at
the
hearing
that
as
i
was
later
on.
i
feel
that
--
that
possibly,
we
--
we
might
have
done
it
that
way,
but
it
begins
at
the
outset,
my
feeling
was
very
strongly
that
we
should
be
entitled
to
counsel
in
that
instance.
mr.
james
f.
graham
we
have
not
--
we
have
not
briefed
it
nor
has
been
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
which
i
take
it
that
is
--
your
question
has
referred
to.
mr.
james
f.
graham
--
and
we
raised
it
in
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
--
for
this
court
then
to
consider.
mr.
james
f.
graham
we
--
your
honor,
it
is
here
only
indirectly.
we
did
raise
the
question.
i'm
saying
that
all
of
these
powers
combined
--
in
other
words,
the
legislature
in
ohio
can
correct
the
in
re
murchison
or
oliver
situation
as
did
the
michigan
legislature
primarily
making
a
--
a
gap
for
saying,
"all
right,
now,
when
we
find
your
man
in
contempt
and
you
find
this
witness
in
contempt
bringing
before
a
member
of
the
judiciary,
bringing
a
man
where
he
can
have
the
--
the
--
a
counsel.”
now,
if
he
is
brought
in
and
had
a
hearing
on
contempt,
i
think
that
complies
with
the
doctrine
laid
by
--
down
by
this
court.
mr.
james
f.
graham
the
statute
does
not
so
provide.
and
in
addition
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right,
your
honor.
but
my
--
my
theory
is
this
that
even
if
this
were
corrected,
i
would
--
i
--
i
submit
that
even
if
these
were
corrected,
these
two
statutes
were
corrected
so
that
they
did
provide
the
necessities
and
the
safeguards
asked
by
this
court
in
the
murchison
and
oliver
case.
i
still
feel
that
when
you
give
a
layman
the
power
of
investigation
and
the
other
powers
granted
by
the
chapter
37
of
the
legislature
of
ohio
to
exclude
counsel
and
declare
it
private
as
no
other
end.
to
me
it
can
have
no
purpose,
and
to
me
it
is
not
right
and
just.
and
under
the
broad
concept
or
a
concept
that
has
stayed
the
same,
but
under
the
changing
of
the
times,
due
process
of
law
which
it
--
my
understanding
is
a
concept
of
fairness
and
righteousness.
and
a
changing
of
time
at
this
court
should
declare
the
--
the
hearings
of
that
nature
to
be
without
the
exclusion
of
counsel.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
in
other
words,
it
might
be
vain.
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
in
other
words,
if
we
would
go
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
had
i
have
raised
--
had
i
--
had
we
have
raised
those
particular
sections
and
ask
them
to
--
to
declare
those
unconstitutional.
but
even
then,
we
would
not
have
been
in
the
position
because
we
did
not
let
our
plans
or
the
petitioners-appellants
be
sworn
and
be
found
out
to
be
in
contempt
on
that
basis.
mr.
james
f.
graham
i'm
--
we're
ready
--
and
the
only
problem
that
we
could
raise
and
that
being
the
right
of
counsel
to
appear.
mr.
james
f.
graham
it
is
now
because
it
has
not
been
raised,
your
honor.
the
--
this
are
the
--
excuse
me.
the
sole
of
question
of
course
i
think
we
have
already
gotten
to
of
course
is
whether
or
not
the
--
an
investigator
for
the
legislature
of
ohio
can
invest
in
an
investigator
such
powers
to
exclude
counsel
when
he
has
his
other
powers
as
are
set
out
in
our
appendix
a.
mr.
james
f.
graham
the
specific
action
that
is
in
question
is
this
section
3737.13
which
we
did
raise
the
constitutionality
in
every
court
and
that
is
this
action
that
says
that
the
fire
marshal
may
determine
a
hearing
to
be
private
and
to
exclude
all
persons
other
than
those
required
to
be
present.
and
in
that
exclusion,
it
has
been
determined
by
our
supreme
court
that
that
includes
counsel.
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
feel
that
action
--
action
be
the
only
--
only
question
before
this
court,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
i
feel
it
is.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
--
i
think
this,
your
honor
that
you
can't
separate
the
two.
i
feel
that
this
power
that
he
has
in
the
hearing
that
the
power
that
the
--
the
legislature
had
--
has
given
him
is
a
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
should
be
entitled
to
in
an
--
in
right
of
counsel.
i
do
not
say
that
in
all
administrative
bodies
or
agencies
that
you
should
have
an
alter
ego
in
the
form
of
an
attorney
by
your
side,
i
don't
feel
it's
necessary.
but
when
they
give
to
that
--
that
administrator
or
that
investigator
the
powers
which
include
the
right
to
summarily
contempt
but
not
necessarily,
only
those
--
but
the
powers
of
subpoenaing
and
the
powers
to
--
at
random
the
--
apparently,
to
determine
what
is
to
be
transcribed.
and
then
to
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
only
by
indirectly,
your
honor.
only
by
saying,
"this
fire
marshal
has
that
power."
therefore,
if
he
has
powers
that
we
declare
or
we
have
shown
are
unconstitutional,
should
then
a
man
or
a
witness
be
called
and
subpoenaed
before
him
without
the
right
of
counsel.
now,
take
away
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
you
question,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
then,
or
course
your
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
i
would
say
that
we'd
have
no
--
certainly
no
right
of
counsel
there.
there
would
be
--
we
would
not
--
it
--
it
is
these
other
powers
that
we're
saying
when
he
has
a
right
to
arrest
and
that
the
--
the
arrest
as
the
statute
is
written
on
--
states
i
believe
at
3737.10,
the
revised
code
says
that
it's
either
he
or
his
assistant
is
on
the
opinion
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
charge
him
of
the
crime
of
arson
or
a
similar
charge.
mr.
james
f.
graham
the
--
he
will
going
to
arrest
him.
mr.
james
f.
graham
yes.
well
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
well
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
bringing
him
in.
if
he's
--
if
he's
in
there
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
--
just
arrest
him
and
--
and
commit
him.
mr.
james
f.
graham
yes,
there
is.
there
is
that
--
the
power
is
under
3737.99
with
revised
code
which
says
that
if
he
violates
.12,
he
can
be
summarily
committed
and
uses
the
language
"summarily
committed."
but
the
section
that
i
am
referring
to,
what
subsection
.10
says
that
he
shall
arrest
him.
mr.
james
f.
graham
3737.13
which
incorporates
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
you're
--
you're
right.
we
have
not
specifically
said
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
we
are
attacking
the
power
to
summarily
commit,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
no,
your
honor,
we
wouldn't.
if
we
could
have
gotten
that
before
the
court
then
our
fact
situation
is
actually
before
this
court.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
this
--
what
i'm
asking
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
your
honor,
if
--
if
the
case
were
remanded
in
the
light
of
the
murchison
and
oliver
cases,
another
fact
pattern
might
well
arise
in
this
particular
case.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would,
but
supposing
that
we
would
go
back
and
the
petitioners-appellants
in
this
particular
case
were
to
present
themselves
to
the
fire
marshal
and
to
be
sworn
and
then
refuse
to
testify,
i
don't
feel
that
the
fire
marshal
would
be
able
to
do
a
thing
in
the
light
of
the
in
re
murchison
and
oliver
cases.
he
has
no
other
power
to
commit
other
than
to
summarily
--
summarily.
however,
we
would
have
to
go
through
that
fact
pattern
to
get
to
that
particular
question
and
then
we
would
not
have
an
issue,
the
right
of
counsel
before
an
--
an
investigator
who
had
the
power
to,
in
addition
to
these
powers
of
summary
commitment.
he
has
the
power
to
--
to
subpoenaing
the
witness.
he
has
the
power
to
arrest
him
if
it
is
his
opinion
and
charge
with
the
crime
of
felony,
a
felon.
and
i
feel
that
that
is
significant
in
and
of
itself.
they
only
have
an
investigator
or
the
administrative
agency
that
has
that
power.
i
know
of
no
--
i
know
of
no
authority
or
no
legislature
that
has
granted
that
much
authority
to
a
layman.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
these
--
these
men
are
still
--
there's
nothing
that
has
happened
to
them.their
situation
has
not
changed,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
oh
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that's
right.
they
refused
to
testify.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
here's
--
here's
exactly
what
did
occur.
when
we
had
the
--
when
we
had
a
--
immediately,
the
first
instance
when
i
had
made
the
phone
call
with
mr.
peterson
and
we
were
scheduled
to
appear
in
front
of
columbus
by
a
subpoena
duces
tecum,
my
father
and
i
contacted
the
chief
justice
weygandt
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
we're
--
we're
in
a
complete
agreement
with
the
attorney
general
of
ohio
that
we
would
submit
the
question
immediately
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
and
we
prepared
our
--
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
no,
your
honor.
if
the
--
what
did
occur,
we
were
to
present
it
immediately
before
the
supreme
court
and
they
had
advised
us
by
rule
of
court
that
would
--
we
would
have
to
wait
a
week
before
they
would
hear
the
writ.
and
while
we
were
hearing
the
--
we
then
proceeded
down
to
the
hearing
room
of
the
fire
marshal
at
that
instance.
after
the
witnesses
--
appellants
refused
to
be
sworn,
he
took
them
down
to
be
incarcerated
and
it
would
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
the
--
no,
the
record
does
not
show
rather
than
that
was
the
date
that
they
--
the
--
that
is
the
same
date
that
they
--
that
we
should
file.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
the
--
the
bond
that
was
to
stay
their
incarceration,
it
was
a
nominal
bond
of
$100
a
person.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right.
and
they
were
taken
and
handed
over
to
the
sheriff.
the
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
yes.
yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
what
i
did,
your
honor
was
this.
we
had
the
--
the
papers
prepared
for
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
and
then,
at
the
--
at
the
hearing,
the
fire
marshal
completely
changed
it.
it
completely
surprised
us
and
the
attorney
general
and
actually
went
out
to
commit
this
man
and
put
them
in
prison.
we
then
had
to
change
the
petition
which
we
had
mimeographed,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
and
submit
it
to
judge
clifford
in
the
common
pleas
court.
i
say
that
as
a
fact
matter
to
show
you
that
the
personalities
that
we're
involved
and
became
involved
in
this
case
between
the
fire
marshal
and
between
our
clients,
the
appellants
herein.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
the
supreme
court
in
its
opinion,
you
mean
how
the
supreme
court
merely
mentioned
that
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
--
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
argued
it
on
two
bases
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
number
one,
that
they
were
private,
did
not
mean
the
exclusion
of
counsel.
and
number
two,
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
if
you'll
see
their
opinion,
they
just
merely
stated
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution
or
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
--
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
f.
graham
the
cases
of
murchison
and
in
re
oliver
were
not
mentioned
to
that
court.
the
--
the
only
--
the
only
issue
that
of
course
will
guarantee
the
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
yes.
that
question
was
brought
before
that
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
that's
right.
and
then
they
decided
that
the
word
private
did
mean
that
they
could
exclude
counsel.
mr.
james
f.
graham
the
private
was
interpreted
to
mean
that
they
could
--
he
could
and
exclude
counsel.
he
--
the
--
the
language
says
private
to
exclude
persons
other
than
those
required
to
be
present.
and
they
said
they
found
no
constitutional
guarantee
that
require
a
--
an
attorney
to
be
present
and
therefore,
there
was
no
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
due
process.
mr.
james
f.
graham
only
if
they
gave
him,
i
believe,
the
same
powers
that
they
have
given
here,
and
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
judiciary.
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
hesitate
to
--
to
pass
on
that.
i'm
not
sure
that
this
court
has
passed
on
them.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
it
may
be
preliminary
and
one
step
removed
from
the
actual
incrimination
but
when
you
get
the
layman
of
the
--
the
powers
that
he
has
given
--
given
here,
i
think
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
i
think
this.
i
think
if
you
have
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
15,
but
--
but
there
is
safety
in
numbers
that
there
will
not
be
the
personalities
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
james
f.
graham
in
my
--
my
humble
opinion,
i
believe
it
would
come
off
and
close
to
it,
your
honor.
if
they
had
no
--
it
was
not
a
judiciary.
he
had
no
safeguards
and
it
was
a
completely
private.
there
was
no
transcript
of
the
record
in
the
sense
that
we
mean
transcribing.
mr.
james
f.
graham
the
grand
jury
is
completely
secret
when
they
deliberate.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that's
right.
but
when
they
deliberate,
i
--
i
don't
feel
that
anyone
is
lying.
mr.
james
f.
graham
the
witness
is
there
--
the
grand
--
the
--
the
prosecutor
is
there
and
had
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
do
not,
your
honor
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
no,
but
you
did
make
reference,
your
honor
to
the
fact
that
it
was
a
delegation
authority
to
a
member
of
the
judiciary,
witness
associates
i
believe.
and
also
that
there
was
--
to
be
transcribed.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
was
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
believe
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
--
that
is
right.
mr.
james
f.
graham
at
least
the
duties
are
to
investigate
a
fire
and
to
see
that
--
to
investigate
for
the
purpose
--
specific
purpose
of
determining
if
there
was
arson
or
a
similar
crime
and
having
the
man
committed
to
it.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
no,
i
didn't.
i
think
i
said
this,
if
the
grand
jury
--
if
--
if
it
was
in
the
event
of
a
grand
jury
and
they
did
not
have
all
of
these
powers
of
commitment
and
there
were
a
number
of
them,
and
then
i
believe
that
--
that
mr.
justice
then
brought
it
down
from
--
from
the
plural
to
the
singular
sense
and
i
don't
believe
i
answer
that.
maybe
i
was
a
mistaken
but
even
if
i
did
it.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that's
right.
mr.
james
f.
graham
the
subpoena
that
the
--
that
--
as
the
power
that
is
granted
to
him
and
i
believe
it
is
3737.10,
appendix
a.
well,
that
is
the
--
it
is
not
10
your
honor,
it
is
11,
.11.
the
fire
marshal
or
an
assistant
fire
marshal
may
summon.
mr.
james
f.
graham
page
18
of
the
appendix
a.
"the
fire
marshal
or
an
assistant
fire
marshal
may
summon
and
compel
the
attendance
of
witnesses
to
testify
in
relation
to
any
matter
which
is
a
proper
subject
of
inquiry
and
investigation
and
may
require
the
production
of
any
book,
paper
or
document."
mr.
james
f.
graham
no,
i
--
i
think
that
you're
going
to
have
to
have
an
administrative
body
that
--
for
this
purpose,
has
the
power
of
subpoena.
i
say
when
you
correlate
that
power
and
supplement
it
with
this
additional
powers
as
outlined
in
appendix
a,
then
i
think
is
giving
that
power
to
a
layman
and
to
an
individual
and
declaring
it
secret.
giving
him
that
power,
then
it
becomes
unconstitutional
to
--
to
deny
the
right
of
counsel.
mr.
james
f.
graham
it
is
the
secrecy
supplemented
by
these
other
powers.
the
--
i
--
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
of
my
time
and
i
would
like
to
close
in
saying
that
the
only
authority
that
i
have
on
something
of
this
nature
is
of
course
the
--
the
wording
that
i
have
selected
from
the
opinion
of
wolf
versus
colorado
of
this
court
wherein
it
was
stated
that
the
concept
of
due
process
was
a
living
principle.
and
i
--i
cannot
add
to
the
wording
of
--
of
this
court
or
expound
on
it
any
further.
i
am
sure
i'll
improve
on
it,
but
i
submit
and
urge
that
in
a
society
or
administrative
society
that
we
are
now
having
or
that
the
constant
investigations
that
i've
developed
that
i
feel
that
--
that
this
matter
is
of
sufficient
of
importance
that
this
honorable
court
should
decide
what
rights
a
person,
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
has
when
appearing
before
an
investigator
that
is
giving
these
--
given
these
powers.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
of
my
time.
mr.
james
f.
graham
not
at
all,
chief
justice.
mr.
james
f.
graham
what
is
to
be
gained
by
sending
this
case
back
for
further
records?
we
take
these
statutes
as
they
are.
we
were
confronted
with
an
assistant
fire
marshal
telling
our
clients,
"you
are
coming
in.
you
are
going
to
bring
your
records.
you're
going
to
be
sworn.
you're
going
to
testify.
you're
going
to
do
it
without
counsel.
there's
a
record
going
to
be
made
and
if
you
fail
to
testify,
we
will
commit
you
until
you
do
testify."
and
that
was
the
order
of
the
commitment
as
provided
by
this
statute,
committed
to
jail
until
he
testify.
now,
that
--
those
statutes
has
to
be
read
together.
now,
where
was
we
as
their
counsel
or
they
as
the
parties
going
to
decide
when
he
had
a
right
to
the
appearance?
mr.
james
f.
graham
to
--
to
be
there.
that
--
what
stage
of
the
game?
it
was
secret.
when
would
be
the
--
when
would
the
parties
be
able
to
come
out
from
the
hearing
and
say,
“now,
counsel
come
in.”
mr.
james
f.
graham
if
they
--
party
is
--
the
witness
is
subpoenaed
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
f.
graham
eyewitness
is
subpoenaed
before
grand
a
jury
in
ohio.
i
do
not
believe
that
they're
entitled
to
counsel,
because
there
--
there
are
15
people
besides
the
prosecutor
and
the
grand
jury
has
no
right
to
commit
if
that
witness
says,
"i
decline
to
testify.
i
decline
to
be
sworn."
all
the
grand
jury
can
do
is
to
go
the
common
pleas
judge
and
present
the
matter
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
acts
from
their
own.
i
want
to
say,
justice
frankfurter
that
it's
a
practice
in
ohio
that
usually
not
to
bring
or
try
to
bring
the
accused
then.
they
watch
that
very
closely.
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
while
we're
on
that
point,
let
us
look
at
section
2935.23
of
the
revised
code.
“examination
of
witnesses
before
arrest
after
a
felony
has
been
committed
and
before
any
arrest
has
been
made,
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
county
or
any
judge
or
magistrate
may
cause
subpoena
to
issue,
returnable
before
any
court
or
magistrate
for
any
person
to
give
information
concerning
such
felony.”
this
subpoena
shall
require
the
witness
to
appear
forthwith.
before
such
witnesses
required
to
give
any
information,
he
must
be
informed
of
the
purpose
of
the
inquiry
and
that
he
is
required
to
tell
the
truth
concerning
the
same.
he
shall
then
be
sworn
and
be
examined
under
oath
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
the
court
or
magistrate,
subject
to
the
penalties
for
perjury
under
section
of
the
code
and
subject
to
the
constitutional
right
of
the
witness.
such
examination
shall
be
taken
in
writing,
in
any
form
and
shall
be
filed
with
the
court
or
magistrate
taking
the
testimony.
here,
we
were
confronted
in
this
case
now
by
saying
"come
in.
bring
your
records.
what
proof
of
loss
is
filed
with
the
insurance
companies
will
have
a
bearing
on
this
case
and
you
testify.
no
counsel."
we
said
“no.”
we
went
to
the
attorney
general's
office,
whom
we
are
on
very
friendly
relationship
and
on
an
honorable
basis
and
said
to
them,
“we
don't
think
that's
the
law,
although
your
former
predecessor
has
said
it
was.”
he
said,
"well,
we
will
be
glad
to
cooperate
with
you
and
have
it
questioned.
get
it
decided."
he
agreed
with
us
that
we
should
go
to
the
supreme
court
and
we
did
went
to
the
chief
justice
weygandt.
and
they
said
they
would
hear
us
one
week,
just
take
a
week
time.
we
said,
“we
have
no
question
of
delay
here.”
now,
remember,
this
is
in
--
in
a
small
community
and
these
things
have
bearings
upon
people's
business
and
upon
their
standing
in
the
community.
and
if
they
--
they
went
in
there
and
didn't
want
to
testify,
the
people
would
gain
the
suspicion
that
they
were
guilty.
it
tells
notoriety.
so,
we
said
we
will
go
to
the
supreme
court
to
save
time.
whoever
is
guilty
of
any
crime
up
there,
we
will
not
try
to
hinder
you
from
finding
out
who
it
is.
it
is
not
that.
it
was
not
our
purpose.
if
you
will
let
my
son
and
i
as
counsel
for
these
men,
we
will
come
in
and
we
will
try
to
answer
any
question
that
you
want
to
ask
us.
we
will
give
you
any
record
that
we
think
you're
entitled
to.
he
said,
"no.
you're
not
coming
in."
the
attorney
general
said,
"well,
look,
let's
get
it
decided.”
said,
“you
get
your
petition
all
ready.
you
come
over.
you'll
have
to
have
it,
show
that,
though
there
have
to
be
a
commitment
because
we
just
couldn't
go
into
court
and
get
a
declaratory
judgment
on
this
case."
so,
with
that
gentleman's
agreement
with
the
fire
marshal
concurring,
we
appear
before
the
fire
marshal
at
1:30
in
the
afternoon.
the
fire
marshal
informs
me.
he
said,
"i'm
not
allowed
to
come
in."
i
said,
"i
understand
that.
i
appreciate
that."
i
said,
“my
clients
are
not
going
to
testify.”
they
went
in,
came
back
out,
refusing
to
testify.
he
comes
out
and
he
says,
"come
on,
you're
going
to
jail."
and
i
said,
"well,
wait
a
minute
here.
we
have
an
agreement.
we're
going
to
the
supreme
court.
you're
not
to
put
these
men
in
jail.
you're
just
to
commit
them.”
"oh,
no."
he
said,
"no,
no.
we're
taking
them
down
to
jail."
so,
they're
defying
my
rights.
i've
got
rights
here
and
i'm
going
to
see
that
they
testify
and
they're
going
to
obey
me.
he
takes
them
down
on
the
elevator,
takes
them
down
to
the
sheriff's
office.
the
attorney
general
was
dumbfounded.
certainly,
it
was
not
in
keeping
with
our
understanding
that
he
--
he
was
shocked
about
it.
now,
no
one,
but
these
prosecutors
were
gentlemen
at
all
times
so
was
the
attorney
general.
they
took
him
down
and
the
sheriff
was
kind
enough
to
let
him
sit
down
in
the
outer
office
and
that's
where
they
remained
until
we
got
one
of
the
common
pleas
judges
to
grant
the
writ.
now,
that's
what
--
that
is
the
actual
facts
as
to
how
these
things
come
up
in
our
hand.
so
then,
when
we
went
in
to
the
common
pleas
court,
we
told
the
common
pleas
court,
"we
raise
the
question
that
they
have
--
that
they
did
have
a
right
to
counsel
in
this
kind
of
a
hearing
before
this
officer
that
had
this
power
--
amended
powers
under
the
statutes."
because
when
we're
going
to
make
the
decision
under
those
cases.
mr.
james
f.
graham
if
the
court
please,
judge
harlan
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
that
is
the
question
that
we
raised
and
had
to
raise
it
in
the
very
beginning.
mr.
james
f.
graham
yes,
if
the
court
please.
we
were
not
going
to
testify
without
counsel
and
we
so
notified
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
--
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
agreed
that
that
would
be
it.
so
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
the
--
the
procedure
was
followed,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
james
f.
graham
no,
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
james
f.
graham
oh,
no,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
don't
understand
that
they
have
to
find
at
all.
but
maybe
i
don't
--
do
not
understand
you.
but
i
--
it
is
our
contention
that
when
the
statutes
have
read
apart
from
this
brilliant
officer,
the
powers
of
these
statutes
have
granted
him,
that
he's
entitled
to
counsel.
that
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out,
we
raised
it
at
the
--
at
the
very
instance,
very
beginning.
then,
as
to
the
fact
that
the
reason
why
the
attorney
general
and
our
office
was
wanting
to
cooperate
with
it,
was
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
away
from
delay.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
certainly
the
--
in
these
--
these
men
are
--
are
wrongly
incarcerated,
because
he
had
no
power
of
commitment.
he
--
under--
under
the
--
under
the
constitution
as
this
court
has
decided
it.
he
had
no
power
of
commitment.
now
--
now,
if
the
court
please,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
suppose
that
they
go
in,
suppose
you
send
it
back
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
--
and
--
and
the
--
and
the
fire
marshal
calls
him
in
again
or
he
had
to
go
back.
now,
as
to
go
back
and
go
back
to
jail,
the
only
way
they
can
get
out
of
jail
is
to
go
back
down
before
the
fire
marshal.
mr.
james
f.
graham
oh,
no.
mr.
james
f.
graham
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
james
f.
graham
he
--
he
goes
back.
he
goes
back
and
--
and
goes
in
and
he
has
no
counsel.
mr.
james
f.
graham
all
right.
now,
he
goes
in
and
he
doesn't
have
any
counsel.
mr.
james
f.
graham
now,
justice
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
knew
the
statutes
of
ohio
as
they
are
now
written.
when
is
he
entitled
to
counsel?
mr.
james
f.
graham
at
--
at
any
stage
of
the
game.
mr.
james
f.
graham
at
any
stage
of
the
game.
so,
therefore,
then
what
does
the
administrative
officer
do,
commit
him
or
find
him
guilty
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
--
and
arrest
him?
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
he
commits
him
for
what,
for
failure
to
testify?
mr.
james
f.
graham
oh,
i
agree
with
you
that
that
could
be
done.
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
we
could
have
said
to
the
court.
we
could
have
said
it
not
to
the
court,
but
to
the
administrative
officer
of
the
fire
marshal
that
we're
not
going
to
testify.
no,
we're
not
going
to
testify.
we're
just
not
going
to
do
it.
we're
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
your
subpoena.
just
ignore
it.
then
had
him
commit
but
he
appoint
him
commit
under
the
statute
and
then
--
and
then
bring
in
the
oliver
case
into
operation.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
that's
what
i
would
say
if
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
say
to
this
court
that
we
raise
the
issue
at
the
very
beginning
and
he
just
proceeded
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
you
didn't
say
that
in
the
murchison
issue
because
that
--
it
was
not
--
it
wasn't
raised
in
that
method
in
the
murchison
case.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
if
--
if
this
case
goes
back,
if
the
court
please.
if
this
case
goes
back,
we
can
write
back
up
with
it.
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
don't
believe
that
under
the
statute
he
has
that
--
he
has
the
right
to
go
to
any,
because
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
--
that
statute
isn't
that
broad.
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
don't
think
so.
that's
our
--
that's
our
honest
contention.
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
f.
graham
oh,
no,
if
the
court
please.
i
doubt
it,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
under
no
circumstances.
i
say
this.
i
don't
think
under
the
oliver
case
that
--
that
the
fire
marshal
can
do
anything.
mr.
james
f.
graham
judge
frankfurter
--
justice,
i
say
to
--
i
--
i
say,
it
is
our
contention
that
we
have
already
got
him
in
that
position.
that
he
has
done
something
that
he's
had
no
right
to
do.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that's
the
question
that
i
--
they
raised.
but
as
justice
black
pointed
out,
the
man
has
been
wrongfully
admitted
--
had
been
wrongfully
committed.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
by
cracking
the
fire
marshal,
the
right
to
do
that.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that's
right.
mr.
james
f.
graham
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
f.
graham
no.
we
didn't
argue
that.
mr.
james
f.
graham
we
--
we
argued
the
point
that
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
yes.
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
we
--
we
argued
that
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way
with
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
didn't
argue
it
from
the
standpoint
if
you
want
to
say
it
of
the
oliver
case
from
that
standpoint,
no.
we
said
that
he
had
no
right
to
commit
him
because
he
wouldn't
let
him
have
counsel,
wouldn't
let
him
have
the
things
that
he
was
entitled
to.
you
see
that
i
didn't
want
to
bring
up
that
test.
i
didn't
want
to
--
i
didn't
want
to
deny
the
right
to
go
--
of
these
people.
i
didn't
want
to
make
up
a
squabble
to
say
that
they
didn't
want
to
testify.
they
wouldn't
testify
because
we
will
testify.
we
will
testify,
but
we
want
counsel.
mr.
james
f.
graham
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
it
--
it
wasn't
the
commitment
that
we
asked
to
have.
you
see,
we
--
we
were
started
out
on
a
--
on
a
friendly
basis
and
it
turned
into
a
very
antagonistic
basis.
you
see,
they
were
never
supposed
to
read
the
--
the
arrested
and
taken
to
jail
or
go
down
to
the
sheriff's
office.
mr.
james
f.
graham
then
--
then,
it
turned
in
--
then
it
--
you
see,
it
turned
in
from
what
you
call
a
friendly
procedure
to
have
a
--
the
statute
constitutionality
question
from
a
friendly
procedure
to
a
very
antagonistic
procedure,
not
because
the
lawyers
are
involved
but
because
that
the
fire
marshal
with
his
actions.
mr.
james
f.
graham
oh,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
black.
there
is
no
--
no
question
about
that
and
they
do,
do
it.
they
--
they
will
do
it.
our
--
our
supreme
court
will
do
those
things.
no
questions
about
that
or
--
in
any
of
our
courts
will
do
that.
they
--
you
do
not
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
that
is
very
essential.
mr.
james
f.
graham
that
is
one
of
the
things.
mr.
james
f.
graham
but
you
see
when
you
start
--
when
i
started
out.
i
have
--
we
have
to
have
--
we
have
to
do
a
purpose
of
protecting
our
clients
and
protecting
the
reputation
as
businessmen.
mr.
james
f.
graham
and
it
was
most
shocking.
i'll
say
to
you,
to
this
court.
i
--
i
have
never
been
shocked
from
a
--
from
a
standpoint
of
the
point
of
law
until
i
got
into
these
fire
marshal
cases
and
i've
never
got
into
him
until
end
of
this
case.
and
when
i
found
that
the
unlimited
power
that
he
has,
he
has
--
he
has
more
power
than
really
a
court
has
in
ohio
under
the
--
under
those
statutes.
of
any
of
our
common
pleas
judges
has,
he
has
more
power
under
those
statutes.
now,
why
--
how
it
ever
got
into
the
law?
i'll
never
--
i'll
never
be
able
to
tell
this
court.
that
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
well,
mr.
justice
black,
if
they
have
been
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
in
muskingum
county
under
this
case
--
we've
never
been
in
any
case
at
all.
they
would
have
gone
there
and
given
whatever
testimony
that
was
--
mr.
james
f.
graham
oh,
no.
no,
no,
mr.
justice
black.
