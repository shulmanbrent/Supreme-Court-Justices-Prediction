mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
should
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
government's
approach
to
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case
and
our
attitude
toward
that
approach.
the
government,
of
course,
attacks,
as
i
think
you
can
see
from
their
very
convenient
document,
all
of
the
important
findings
that
the
trial
court
made
on
the
three
issues
which
mr.
davis
has
stated
as
roughly
the
issue
of
control,
the
issue
of
intent,
and
the
issue
of
restraint
of
trade.
now,
the
government
in
its
brief
in
here
characterizes
those
findings
in
some
different
ways
and
i'm
not
going
to
quarrel
over
terminology.
i
just
want
to
say
that
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
whether
you
call
them
basic
or
conclusions
or
ultimate.
they're
still
findings
of
fact.
they're
a
distillation
from
the
record
and
they
are
a
distillation
from
a
very
large
body
of
evidence.
and
i
also
should
like
to
observe
at
this
point
that
it
seems
to
us
that
those,
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
the
government's
attack
on
those
findings.
in
the
first
place,
we
do
not
agree
that
its
attack
is
consistent
with
the
findings
which
it
does
not
attack.
i
will
enforce
my
argument,
i
think
to
point
to
the
two
or
three
--
four
important
instances
where
what
they
argue
now
is
inconsistent
with
findings
that
they
have
accepted.
the
other
observation
i
should
like
to
make
is
that
in
one
side,
the
trial
court
i
think
did
put
in
the
opinion
and
findings
most
of
the
things
which
he
regarded
as
significant.
but
in
throughout
the
opinion,
particularly
when
he
reaches
a
finding,
which
requires
the
consideration
of
a
large
body
of
evidence,
the
trial
court
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
findings
are
not
necessarily
self-sufficient
or
self-contained.
he
repeatedly
says,
i
find
this
on
the
whole
record
or
i
find
this
on
all
of
the
evidence.
and
when
you
consider
how
that
he
heard
this
case,
listened
to
the
testimony
and
the
witnesses
for
nearly
seven
months
and
at
the
end
of
that
seven
months,
after
full
briefing,
there
was
an
argument
that
lasted
11
days.
the
kind
of
paradise
for
counsel
in
which
the
facts
were
fully
discussed
to
the
trial
judge,
you
could
understand
why
he
approached
the
problem
in
that
way.
there
is
one
other
thing
i
want
to
say
just
so
this
case,
the
facts
can
be
viewed
in
the
proper
context.
before
this,
the
government
brought
this
case,
there
was
a
full
and
complete
investigation
by
the
government.
the
du
pont
company
cooperated
with
that
investigation.
they
came
in
and
we
voluntarily
opened
our
files.
there
was
no
--
except
for
privilege
document
of
the
counsel,
there
was
no
withholding.
they
copied
and
took
away
about
3000
documents
and
then
after
that
they
had
a
grand
jury
proceeding,
and
purchasing
agents
of
general
motors,
and
officers,
and
officials
of
both
general
motors
and
du
pont
testified
before
that
grand
jury.
and
we
supplied
them
with
information
to
the
grand
jury
and
quite
properly
as
they
should.
they
used
some
of
that
information
in
this
case.
now,
the
only
thing
i
want
to
say
about
that
is
that
i
think
this
court
can
be
sure
that
when
they
went
in
to
the
district
court
in
this
case,
they
had
in
their
possession
every
fact
that
the
apparatus
of
the
federal
government
could
get
forth.
they
had
everything
and
they
made
the
best
possible
case
they
could.
now,
with
those
preliminary
remarks,
i
think
that
i
should
like
to
address
myself
at
once
to
the
question
which
seems
to
me
is
--
is
really
crucial
on
this
case
and
i
put
it
very
simply,
and
that's
the
question
of
what
has
happened
or
what
did
happen
in
the
34
years
that
this
relationship
existed?
was
there
a
restraint
of
trade?
did
du
pont
get
a
noncompetitive
preferential
advantage
when
it
dealt
with
general
motors
in
its
commercial
relation?
that
seems
to
me
what
this
case
is
about.
if
it
--
if
on
the
facts
there
was
no
such
preferential
advantage,
it
seems
to
me
that
these
arguments
about
intent
and
control
certainly
have
far
less
significance.
but
one
thing
just
as
an
evidentiary
matter,
as
mr.
davis
has
quite
candidly
said.
if
in
34
years,
you
can't
prove
any
realization
of
the
intent
or
any
exercise
of
the
power,
that's
pretty
strong
evidence
that
it
didn't
exist
anyway.
so
that
--
that
--
it
is
to
that
aspect
in
the
case
and
to
the
findings
which
the
trial
court
made
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
that
i
should
like
to
address
myself.
and
i
should
like
also
to
say
this.
i
think
anyone
coming
to
this
case
and
looking
simply
at
the
two
companies
and
looking
at
the
stock
relationship,
seeing
the
people
on
the
board
of
directors
and
on
the
committees,
and
then
looking
at
the
volume
of
purchases,
i
think
it's
quite
natural
for
someone
to
say,
"well,
there
must
be
some
relationship
between
those
two
things.
it
just
--
just
seems
reasonable.”
but
that,
i
remind
the
court
is
a
question
of
fact
and
because
we
might
approach
that
case,
anyone
i
think,
naturally
and
humanly
might
approach
that
case
with
that
preconception,
for
that
is
what
it
would
be,
a
preconception
based
on
all
of
the
fact
or
part
of
the
fact,
does
not
change
the
problem
which
is
involved,
which
is
the
problem
of
looking
at
all
the
facts
and
seeing
whether
that
first
impression
or
that
preconception,
as
i
think
it
is,
natural
preconception
is
really
true
and
that
is
what
was
done
in
this
case
at
great
length
and
in
detail.
huge
slice
of
life
in
his
record,
34
years
of
it,
the
trial
court
made
its
findings
on
that
basis.
the
evidence
in
the
limits
of
an
appellate
argument
is
not
really
capable
of
being
dealt
with
in
detail.
i
shall
have
to
summarize
it
but
there
are
some
general
things
i
should
like
to
say
before
i
try
to
deal
with
some
aspects
of
it,
including
this
matter
of
the
volume
of
sale,
that
i
should
in
some
general
things
i
should
like
to
say.
the
one
which
is
most
important
in
understanding
the
case
and
understanding
the
situation
is
this.
since
1922,
general
motors
has
operated
on
a
decentralized
basis.
that
means
that
except
for
matters
which
involve
the
investment
of
substantial
amounts
of
capital
in
all
other,
in
operating
matters,
each
division
is
autonomous.
it
makes
its
own
decisions
about
--
particularly
about
what
it
will
buy.
so
that
when
i
speak
as
i
shall
or
when
mr.
davis
speaks
of
the
totality
of
general
motors
purchases,
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
result
that
is
achieved
by
separate
and
independent
decisions
made
by
purchasing
agents
in
the
various
decisions
--
divisions.
we're
not
speaking
about
a
decision
made
by
small
group
of
men
in
the
central
office
of
general
motors.
now,
there
was
a
short
period
of
time
in
the
1920s,
when
there
was
a
central
purchasing
committee,
which
in
the
case
of
certain
commodities
and
under
certain
conditions
did
some
central
purchasing.
the
government
has
now
abandoned
the
contentions
that
it
made
about
that
committee.
it
no
longer
challenges
the
trial
court's
findings
which
are
to
the
effect
that
that
committee,
that
central
purchasing
committee
dealt
with
du
pont
just
as
it
dealt
with
any
other
supplier.
so
that
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
this
--
what
i
have
to
say
we
can
dispose
--
dispense
with
as
any
further
talk
about
the
central
purchasing
committee.
and
it
is
because
of
this
autonomy
that
in
my
description
of
the
facts,
i
shall
frequently
speak
of
selling
to
a
division
instead
of
selling
to
general
motors,
because
that's
what
the
way
this
business
was
operating.
now,
with
those
--
with
that
fact
leads
to
another
fact,
which
i
think
is
extremely
important
in
this
case.
speaking
generally
as
i
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
he
may
--
yes,
and
frequently
does.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
and
that
there
are
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
that's
right
and
he
would
--
they
--
that
doesn't
mean,
mr.
justice
reed,
necessarily
that
every
head
of
a
division
would
be
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors,
but
they
have
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
--
in
the
case
of
the
very
large,
when
such
as
chevrolet,
they
frequently
are.
in
the
case
of
the
rest
of
them,
mr.
justice
reed,
it
was
not
the
usual
practice
for
the
--
for
the
heads
of
the
divisions
and
speaking
generally
to
be
on
the
board
of
directors.
that
was
because
the
corporation
i
think
that
mr.
--
under
mr.
sloan's
guidance,
early
adopted
the
policy
of
having
the
operating
people
not
on
the
board
of
directors.
the
board
of
directors
performed
a
somewhat
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
policy
in
operations
and
they
--
the
link
between
the
divisions
and
the
top,
the
central
office
was
performed
by
committee
usually,
in
which
there
--
there
was
one
time
an
operations
committee
i
think
that
some
of
these
people
were
and
it
was
--
the
coordination
was
achieved
that
way
and
it
was
also
achieved
to
some
extent
by
having
some
staff
or
central
services,
which
were
performed
in
the
central
office.
but
on
the
operations
level,
the
divisions
operated
in
an
independent
and
autonomous
way.
accountable
of
course
to
the
--
to
the
board
of
directors
and
to
the
top
management,
if
they
got
into
trouble
or
they
were
in
trouble
and
something
happened
to
them.
but
within
those
limits,
i
think
mr.
sloan,
in
his
testimony
has
said
the
head
of
a
division
was
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
reed,
i
frankly
can't
answer
that
question
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
record
shows
whether
they
would
compete
in
that
sense
or
not.
they
certainly
competed
in
some
areas
in
some
ways
in
the
sale
of
cars,
in
the
market
as
you
know
but
i
don't
--
sure
the
record
shows
what
they
did
as
to
--
there
is
an
interesting
evidence
that
now,
that
you
remind
of
it,
that
in
early
days
at
one
time
when
there
was
a
shortage
of
fabrics,
they
were
sort
of
competing
about
which
one
could
get
fabrics
from
du
pont.
but
i
--
i
couldn't
go
beyond
that
in
answering
that
question.
now
this
--
this
--
speaking
very
generally
about
the
evidence
as
mr.
davis,
i
think,
quite
candidly
has
said.
there
is
ample
and
substantial
evidence
in
this
record
that
shows
that
these
divisions
have
bought
from
du
pont
and
from
other
people
on
the
basis
of
the
ordinary
business
consideration,
quality
of
product,
service
and
price.
and
as
you
might
expect,
that
same
evidence
shows
that
there
has
been
a
great
diversity
of
purchases
among
the
various
divisions.
some
divisions
will
buy
a
product
almost
entirely
from
du
pont
as
chevrolet
does
its
paint.
other
divisions
won't
buy
that
product
from
du
pont
at
all.
oldsmobile
buys
very
little
paint
for
example
from
du
pont.
some
of
them
will
buy
or
one
division
will
buy
a
commodity.
there's
a
kind
of
paint
called
engine
enamel,
which
oldsmobile
oddly
enough
buys
from
du
pont.
no
one
else
in
general
motors
buy
that.
they
bought
fabrics
in
different
amounts
and
at
different
times.
no
--
no
pattern
at
all
came
out
of
this,
of
--
of
general
survey
of
these
purchases.
that's
all
set
forth
in
the
findings
of
the
--
of
the
trial
judge,
uncontested
findings
in
large
part.
we
think
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
government's
notion
or
assertion
that
this
stock
relationship
in
some
way
affected
the
sales.
i
say
that
particularly
in
view
of
the
concessions
that
the
government
has
made
about
the
way
this
relationship
operates.
the
government
has
never
contended
that
there
was
any
overall
direction
about
this
thing
from
above.
there
was
never
any
directive,
no
resolution
from
the
board
of
directors,
no
resolutions
from
the
top
committees,
nothing
of
that
kind.
and
now
the
government
concedes
and
i
think
that
it
must
that
the
salesmen
and
the
purchasing
agents
didn't
act
on
any
basis
of
that
kind.
they
testified
and
the
government
takes
their
testimony.
you
might
almost
get
the
impression
that
this
restraint
of
trade
is
rather
like
a
mist
that
this
pervades
everything
but
operates
without
the
assistance
of
any
human
hands
or
any
human
mind.
i
don't
think
the
government
really
intends
it's
concession
to
go
quite
that
far.
but
it
does
say
that
the
--
that
the
inherent,
any
inheritable
effect
of
the
relationship
was
to
poison
these
transactions,
so
that
general
motors
just
must
have
favored
du
pont.
now,
when
they
put
their
point
that
way,
i
think
they're
under
a
heavy
burden
of
explaining
why
a
relationship
that
was
said
to
be
inherent
and
inevitable
didn't
operate
in
an
inherent
and
inevitable
way.
why
it
wasn't
uniform,
and
constant,
and
continuing?
why
was
it
that
it
would
operate
as
to
some
commodities
and
not
as
to
others?
why
did
it
operate
at
one
time
in
one
way,
and
another
time
in
a
different
way?
why
did
it
operate
as
to
some
purchasing
agents
and
not
as
to
others?
it
seems
to
me
you
can't
possibly
reconcile
this
notion
of
the
relationship
and
its
effect
as
they
have
set
it
out
with
this
evidence.
in
their
reply
brief
they
--
they
feel
they
have
to
deal
with
that
problem
and
they
say,
well,
when
general
motors
didn't
buy
from
du
pont,
that
was
just
because
du
pont
really
wasn't
trying
to
sell
to
them
or
didn't
really
make
an
effort
to
exercise
its
influence.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
troubles
with
that
argument.
one
of
them
is
that
there's
an
uncontested
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
the
documents
indicate
that
du
pont
was
always
interested
in
selling
to
general
motors
to
the
extent
of
100%
of
its
requirements
and
there's
another
trouble
which
i
think
is
even
more
difficult
for
the
government
when
they
tried
to
prove
intent.
this
intent
they
speak
of,
the
way
they
prove
intent
is
by
documents
from
the
files
of
the
du
pont
company
that
show
that
du
pont
was
trying
to
sell
everything
it
could
and
beside
that
we
have
all
the
testimony
of
the
salesmen.
we
have
a
great
deal,
much
documentary
evidence
in
this
case
which
the
defendants,
offered
showing
these
constant
efforts
to
sell,
many
of
them
unsuccessful.
now,
with
those
general
observations
about
the
--
the
--
but
before
i
leave
that,
let
me
say
this.
the
government
attacks
these
purchases
as
being
--
they
--
they
now
say
that
they
wanted
it
all
bad.
they
don't
tell
us
which
ones
exactly
were
bad.
they
suggest
some
part
of
the
duco
sales
were
bad.
they
don't
even
say
as
i
understand
it
that
all
of
the
duco
sales
were
bad.
those
arguments
if
they
could
be
justified
on
the
facts,
which
they
cannot,
would
raise
some
very
difficult
questions
of
law
i
think
as
to
just
what
the
status
of
this
alleged
restraint
is
but
i
don't
want
to
talk
about
the
law.
i
want
to
talk
about
facts
whether
that
--
whether
they
--
they
can
justify
that
kind
of
a
finding
of
fact,
which
they
say
the
trial
court
should
have
made.
they
did
not
bring
forward
any
evidence
in
the
district
court
that
related
directly
to
these
sales.
they
didn't
bring
forward
any
evidence
that
showed
that
general
motors
could
have
bought
things
at
the
same
time
from
anybody
else
that
was
good
at
the
same
price.
they
weren't
able
to
find
any
disgruntled
employee
come
in
and
testify
about
directions
that
he'd
been
given,
and
they
were
not
able
to
find,
and
this
i
think
very
significant
throughout
this
34-year
period,
any
past
or
present
competitor
of
du
pont,
or
anybody
operating
in
these
various
industries
to
come
in
and
testify
that
general
motors
had
given
du
pont
some
favor,
or
that
he'd
been
handicapped
in
some
way
because
of
the
stock
relationship
in
trying
to
sell
to
general
motors.
there's
just
isn't
any
evidence
to
that
kind
to
counterbalance
the
affirmative
evidence
that
we
had
put
in
the
record,
which
the
trial
court
took
in
his
findings
that
these
sales
were
made
on
merit,
were
made
on
the
ordinary
and
unordinary
business
way.
instead,
the
government
has
to
fall
back
on
this
argument
about
the
volume
of
sales.
and
it's
the
next
thing
i
should
like
to
talk
about
because
it
really
is
the
only
argument
that
the
government
has
to
--
that
has
anything
to
do
with
these
sales
and
it's
a
statistical
argument.
i
think
at
the
beginning
that
i
should
like
to
clarify
one
point
that
i
think
perhaps
mr.
davis
inadvertently
left
in
--
in
some
uncertainty.
when
he
speaks
of
98%
of
our
sales
being
made
to
--
to
general
motors,
that
figure
is
90%
of
the
sales
of
automotive
paint
made
to
automotive
manufacturers
for
original
application
on
automobiles.
now,
that's
not
all
the
paint
we
sell
to
general
motors.
we
sell
to
general
motors
paint
for
all
purposes.
we
sell
them
paint
for
--
to
put
on
parts
of
machinery,
refrigerators,
locomotives
which
they
make,
house
paint,
all
sorts
of
paint.
and
we
sell
that
kind
of
paint,
the
same
kinds
of
paint
to
other
people
and
when
you
compare
the
sales
of
the
kinds
of
paint,
all
kinds
of
paint
that
general
motors
make
or
that
general
motors
buys,
which
du
pont
makes
for
general
motors,
with
the
sales
of
the
same
kind
of
paint
for
the
same
purposes
that
are
made
by
du
pont
to
everybody
else,
the
percentage
is
not
90%
it's
about
20%.
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no
that's
--
that
includes
duco,
but
it's
a
lot
of
other
things
besides
duco,
mr.
justice
burton.
now,
on
--
on
duco
or
on
the
automotive
paint
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
when
the
court
rose,
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
government's
statistical
argument
on
the
percentage
of
du
pont
sales
that
are
made
to
general
motors
and
i
should
like
to
continue
with
that
discussion
now.
i
had
just
made
the
point
that
if
the
issue
is
whether
du
pont's
products
are
capable
on
their
merits
of
gaining
a
position
in
the
market,
independent
of
influence
or
control
or
some
stock
relationship,
then
the
fact
that
it
sold
the
same
kind
of
paints
to
other
people
that
it
sold
to
general
motors
in
a
percentage
relationship
of
80:20
instead
of
the
other
way
around
as
it
is
in
the
case
of
the
sales
to
automobile
manufacturers
was
quite
significant.
i
want
to
meet
the
government
on
the
automobile
manufacturers
themselves
meets
them
on
their
own
ground.
before
i
do
that
however,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
this
larger
figure
i
gave
you
sales
to
--
all
sales
as
distinguished
from
simply
sales
to
automotive
manufacturers.
and
as
i
said
before
includes
substantial
sales
of
paint
used
for
exactly
the
same
purpose
that
automotive
paint
as
used,
it
sold
to
general
motors.
for
example,
those
--
that
larger
figure
includes
all
of
the
paint
is
not
reflected
in
the
government's
figure
which
is
sold
for
refinishing
automobiles
that
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
overall
paint
sales
in
--
for
example,
in
1947,
mr.
justice
brennan,
ran
around
the
$105
millin
so
is
their
sales
to
everybody
abruptly
the
same
kind
of
paints
that
we
sell
to
general
motors.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
the
--
i
think
the
$30
million,
see
i
believe
that
the
--
the
$30
million
figure,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
a
figure
of
all
sales
of
all
products
by
du
pont
to
general
motors.
in
1947
for
example,
i
think
the
precise
figures
ran
about
this
way.
the
total
sales,
everything,
paint,
fabrics,
chemicals
ran
around
$26
million,
du
pont
sales
to
general
motors.
all
that
about
$19
million
are
--
consisted
of
sales
of
paint,
about
71%
thereabout.
of
that
--
of
that
$19
million
of
paint,
about
$12
million
consisted
of
what
are
called
automotive
sales
which
are
roughly
--
rough
--
i
think
roughly,
perhaps
accurate
to
speak
of
as
of
duco
acrylic
which
is
a
topcoat
put
on
--
on
a
car.
those
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
you
can
--
the
government
--
government's
computation
is
made
in
this
way
and
that's
where
the
--
the
90%
figure
comes
from.
they
take
all
sales
of
paint
to
automobile
companies
for
original
application
to
the
bodies
and
to
automobile.
and
that
for
example
--
that
figure
if
i
may
--
without
confusing
you,
for
example,
that
figure
as
to
general
motors
would
not
include
any
paint
sold
to
general
motors
for
refrigerators
or
house
paint
or
for
painting
industrial
objects
that
didn't
work
directly
related
to
the
automobile.
they
then
compare
that
figure
with
the
comparable
figure
for
sales
to
other
automobile
manufacturers.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
i
give
it
to
you
in
percentages,
sir.
their
percentages,
the
percentages
which
they
have
used
are
--
my
purpose
is
acceptable.
that
percentage
figure
varies,
sometimes
it's
80%,
sometimes
it's
higher
than
that
and
sometimes
it's
been
90%.
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
you
make
a
computation
on
that
basis,
by
far,
the
highest
percentage
of
sales
computed
that
way
is
made
by
du
pont
to
general
motors.
we
don't
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
readily
because
these
percentages
were
excerpted
from
some
reports
and
they're
in
the
record,
but
we
don't
test
the
percentage
figure
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
not
--
yes,
yes,
that's
the
figure
i'm
talking.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
he
is
substantially
correct
if
you
compute
the
figure
that
way,
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'll
try
to
explain
it
to
you
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
as
to
paint
sold
to
automobile
manufacturers
for
original
application
to
automobile.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
let
me
give
you
these
figures
which
may
help.
in
1947,
and
i
think
this
will
show
the
volume.
my
recollection
is
if
i'm
correct
that
the
sale
of
paint
of
this
--
of
automotive
sales
were
about
$12
million.
is
that
right?
of
duco's
--
that's
right,
it's
about
$12
million.
now,
in
the
same
year,
i
think
my
recollection
is
correct.
on
the
same
basis
again,
the
sales
made
to
other
automobile
manufactures
were
around
$3
million.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
that's
what
i'm
going
to
talk
about
now,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
beginning
that
so
far
as
that
argument
is
intended
to
suggest
that
the
sales
of
the
paint
to
automobile
field
manufacturers,
that
particular
kind
of
paint
can't
make
their
way
on
their
merits
that
these
sales
which
we
make
of
the
same
paint
for
the
same
purposes
to
other
people
provide
a
basis
for
a
contrary
inference.
let
me
illustrate
what
i
mean.
they
say
general
motors
buy
too
much
duco
and
there's
something
strange
about
that.
well,
now,
the
fact
is
that
75%
of
the
class
1
railroads
in
this
country
specify
that
duco
must
be
used
on
the
outside
of
all
passenger
cars.
they
also
specify
that
it
must
be
used
on
locomotives.
for
that
reason,
we
sell
about
75%
of
the
requirements
of
the
electromotive
division
of
general
motors
because
the
railroads
tell
them
they
want
the
duco
used
on
the
locomotives.
now,
that
figure,
i
hope
i've
made
clear
those
sales
are
not
included
in
this
80%,
90%
figure
because
they
are
not
sales
to
automobile
manufacturers.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
26
and
47.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
26
and
47.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
i
think
i
understand.
the
record
unfortunately
is
not
entirely
clear
on
that
but
the
next
largest
paint
item
for
example
is
$3
million
of
dulux
that
is
sold
to
general
motors
to
put
on
frigidaire,
iceboxes,
cleaners,
washers,
dryers
and
things
of
that
kind.
now,
the
record
doesn't
show
an
exact
percentage
of
the
sales
to
other
people,
but
it
shows
that
du
pont
supplies
practically
100%
of
the
requirements
of
westinghouse,
general
electric
and
crosley
for
that
kind
of
paint.
so,
i
think
it
maybe
assumed
in
view
of
their
position
in
the
refrigerator
business
that
those
sales
are
substantial.
now,
in
fabrics,
you
do
get
a
situation
somewhat
like
the
paint
situation.
the
fabrics
--
the
great
percentage
of
the
fabrics
sold
to
automobile
manufacturers
for
use
in
the
original
construction
of
automobiles
is
sold
by
du
pont
to
general
motors.
now,
they
do
sell
a
very
substantial
amount
of
fabric
to
other
people
who
use
it
for
the
same
purpose
that
general
motors
does.
for
example,
people
--
much
of
this
is
used
for
upholstery
in
trucks
and
things
of
that
kind
where
you
need
something
heavier
than
the
cloth
fabric.
the
du
pont
company
sells
substantial
amounts
of
--
of
fabrics
for
that
purpose
to
people
who
make
theatre
seats
and
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
theatre
seats.
manufactures
--
seat
--
seats
or
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i'm
--
i'm
making
the
same
point
again.
i
say
as
to
the
automobile
industry,
the
percentage
is
what
the
government
calls
a
disproportionate
percentage.
now,
their
--
invest
about
other
products.
there
are
some
other
products
involved.
one
of
them
--
important
one,
are
the
chemicals
that
are
used
in
case
hardening.
that's
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
from
the
du
pont
company?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that's
right
and
i'm
--
i'm
going
to
speak
about
that,
mr.
justice
reed,
if
i
can
in
just
a
moment.
in
fact,
i
shall
do
now
--
do
so
now.
and
i'd
like
to
begin
by
saying
that
of
course
as
i
take
it,
the
court
realizes
that
what
we
are
concerned
here
is
that
it's
a
problem
of
why
general
motors
buy
so
much
as
compared
with
other
people
who
don't
buy
as
much.
so,
what
we
are
inquiring
into
are
the
reasons
really
why
the
purchases
are
greater
on
the
one
side
than
on
the
other.
the
government
says
the
reason
is
stock.
now,
for
that
inference
just
as
a
matter
of
logic
to
have
any
force,
i
think
you
have
to
know
something
about
the
reasons
why
the
other
people
don't
buy
more
from
--
from
du
pont
and
that's
what
i'm
about
to
tell
you.
of
course,
if
they
didn't
buy,
if
there
was
any
evidence
that
they
didn't
buy
because
of
some
doubts
about
the
quality
or
the
price
or
the
service
of
du
pont's
product,
i
think
the
government
would
have
a
--
have
a
basis
for
its
inference.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
even
then,
that
inference
would
overcome
the
affirmative
testimony
we
have
from
these
people
who
buy
the
paint
about
why
they
buy
it.
but
now,
let
me
speak
about
the
reasons
why
ford
and
chrysler
don't
buy
more
from
du
pont
and
that's
really
what
it
comes
down
to
because
those
two
companies
together
with
general
motors
account
for
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
--
of
the
automobile
production
in
this
country.
now,
each
of
them
is
a
little
different,
but
i
think
each
of
them
to
the
facts,
in
some
of
these
facts,
not
all
of
them,
but
some
of
them
are
in
the
uncontested
findings
of
the
trial
court.
he
didn't
cover
all
of
them,
but
he
covered
some
of
it.
i
think
those
facts
are
inconsistent
with
the
government's
inference.
let's
take
the
case
of
ford
first.
ford
for
many
years
before
1939,
always
bought
a
substantial
amount
of
paint
from
du
pont,
automotive
paint
to
put
on
automobiles.
but
ford
long
ago,
under
the
guidance
of
mr.
henry
ford
sr.
embarked
on
a
policy,
not
only
as
to
paint
and
fabrics
but
as
to
a
lot
of
other
things,
of
making
a
major
part
of
its
own
products.
so,
they
started
making
their
own
paint
and
their
own
fabric.
now,
just
stopping
there,
let
me
observe.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
fact
that
ford
decided
for
reasons
of
its
own
to
make
these
things
instead
of
to
buy
them
in
the
market
proves
very
much
about
why
general
motors
buy
it.
but
there's
a
little
more
i
can
say
about
ford.
the
significant
thing
about
ford
is
what
it
does
when
it
goes
into
the
open
market
and
buys
the
things
that
it
doesn't
make.
now,
throughout
--
most
to
the
period
of
time
covered
by
this
record,
when
it
went
into
the
open
market
and
bought,
it
bought
in
large
quantities
from
du
pont.
in
fact,
there
was
a
long
period
in
the
late
1920s
and
1930s,
when
it
bought
from
du
pont
all
of
the
alkyd
resin
finish
which
it
used
on
the
outside
of
cars.
that's
the
automotive
paint
that
we've
been
talking
about.
it
bought
all
of
that
from
du
pont
that
it
didn't
make.
our
time
came
about
1938
or
1939
when
mr.
henry
ford
sr.
decided
one
day
that
he
wouldn't
buy
anything
more
from
du
pont,
anything
and
instructions
came
down
to
stop.
when
henry
ford
ii
took
over
the
company
after
the
war,
the
purchases
resumed.
and
today,
the
extent
that
they
don't
buy
or
don't
make
their
own
paint,
they
buy.
the
record
shows.
it
doesn't
show
the
exact
amounts,
but
they
buy
substantial
quantities
of
paint
from
du
pont.
their
purchases
are
included
in
the
$3.5
million
worth
of
paint
sold
to
other
automobile
manufacturers
that
i
told
the
court
about.
now,
the
story
--
and
i'll
stop
there
again
and
i
--
i'd
submit
that
on
that
basis,
even
the
inference
which
the
government
tries
to
draw
isn't
justified
in
the
case
of
ford.
i
don't
even
come
to
the
question
of
whether
the
inference
is
enough
to
overcome
the
affirmative
testimony.
now,
chrysler
has
a
different
story.
chrysler,
during
the
1920s
and
the
1930s,
early
1930s
also
bought
a
substantial
amount
of
paint
from
du
pont.
i
couldn't
get
the
figures
for
those
remote
periods
but
there
is
no
dispute
it
did
buy.
i
think
there's
an
uncontested
finding
on
that.
then
a
time
came,
i
think
it
was
about
1937,
when
chrysler
adopted
a
different
policy
and
there's
uncontested
testimony
at
least
on
this,
i'm
not
clear
at
the
moment
whether
it's
in
the
findings.
the
man
who
would
--
the
du
pont
company
who'd
been
dealing
with
them
came
to
see
them
and
i
think
it
was
mr.
keller.
chrysler
said,
“we
have
adopted
a
new
policy.
we
have
decided
that
we're
going
to
buy
the
greater
part
of
our
paint,
if
not
all
of
it,
from
some
company
who
doesn't
really
sell
paint
to
anybody
but
us.
we
want
to
have
one
company
that
really
depends
on
us
for
its
business.”
and
the
salesman
said,
“well,
this
is
a
great
blow
to
me.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
our
paint?
is
there
anything
wrong
with
our
service?
have
we
done
anything
wrong?"
and
mr.
keller
said,
“no,
your
product
and
your
service
have
always
been
highly
satisfactory,
but
we
have
just
decided
that
we
were
going
to
have
one
company
that
--
who
would
be
our
principal
supplier
and
who
will
look
to
us
for
the
major
part
of
its
sales.”
now,
i'm
sure
it
will
immediately
occur
to
the
court
that
what
that
incident
indicates
is
that
this
so-called
disproportionate
percentage
can
occur
in
a
very
normal
business
relationship
without
any
influence
of
stock
or
anything
else.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
think
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
reed,
and
in
many
cases
i
also
go
after
--
go
outside
the
record
a
little
bit,
but
i
have
heard
of
cases
where
purchasers,
particularly
large
scale
purchasers
thought
it
was
to
their
advantage
to
be
in
a
position
where
they
were
buying.
they
had
a
supplier
who
is
largely
dependent
on
them
for
their
business.
now,
there's
another
example
in
the
record
which
i'm
reminded
of
that
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
now
buys
--
it
has
continued
to
buy,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
from
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
company.
and
while
we
couldn't
get
any
figures,
there
are
two
exhibits
in
the
record
which
there
are
trade
reports,
contemporaneous
documents
made
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
which
say
that
chrysler
is
the
principal
customer
of
pittsburgh
plate
glass
company.
and
their
documents
also
indicate
that
chrysler
buys
by
far
the
major
part
of
its
requirements
from
pittsburgh
plate
glass
company.
just
as
bearing
on
this
so-called
disproportionate
percentage,
i
should
like
to
give
the
court
one
more
example
which
i
think
is
--
is
--
makes
my
point
too.
one
of
the
companies
that
sells
paint
in
pretty
substantial
quantities
to
general
motors
is
a
company
called
rinshed-mason.
it
sells
topcoats
for
automobiles
to
some
of
these
divisions
that
won't
buy
it
from
--
from
du
pont.
now,
there
are
exhibits
in
the
records,
i
think
it
takes
about
four
exhibits.
unfortunately,
we
didn't
get
this
in
our
brief,
but
there
are
exhibits
in
the
record
from
which
you
can
compute
rinshed-mason's
total
automotive
sales
and
established
a
relationship
between
those
sales
and
its
sales
to
du
pont.
and
it
appears
that
in
the
case
of
that
company,
it
sells
upwards
of
90%
of
its
paint
on
this
same
basis
to
du
pont.
no
suggestion
i
suppose
by
anyone
that
general
motors
buys
from
rinshed-mason
on
some
favored
or
noncompetitive
position.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
there
was
a
witness,
mr.
justice
brennan,
named
(inaudible)
who
testified
at
some
length
about
that
and
he
said
that
they
constantly
--
that's
one
of
the
staff
functions
as
performed
in
the
central
office.
they
constantly
test
these
finishes
and
they
then
--
that
goes
on
all
the
time.
they
then
report
to
the
various
provisions
what
lacquers
and
topcoats
meets
the
standards
and
the
divisions
themselves
then
make
a
decision
as
to
which
one
they
will
take.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
i
think
that's
--
that
certainly
the
--
the
purport
of
that
testimony.
what
this
witness
said
was
that
they
generally
have
found
three
suppliers
whose
finishes
are
satisfactory.
and
they
--
they
found
no
one
whose
finishes
are
any
better
than
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
this
is
--
this
was
the
witness
from
staff
whose
business
was
to
test
these
lacquers.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
there
was
--
let
me
say
this
first.
this
witness
who
testified
from
the
staff
was
qualified
by
examination
with
respect
to
the
buying
practices
of
the
divisions
and
testifying
about
that,
and
his
testimony
was
not
shaken
on
cross-examination.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
there
is
a
finding,
yes,
in
the
sense
of
the
judge's
clear
finding
that
shows
that
the
judge
relied
upon
his
testimony.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
that's
a
challenged
finding,
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
finding
is
on
the
record.
it's
in
the
--
or
in
the
government's
appendix.
i
think
at
about
page
395
--
396.
clarity
williams
and
(inaudible)
all
made
it
clear.
(inaudible)
is
the
test
--
is
the
witness
that
i
have
been
talking
about.
there
was
also
a
testimony
of
the
same
kind,
very
significant
testimony
from
a
man
named
vector
who
for
many
years
had
been
in
buick,
who
was
an
operating
man
and
who
had
been
there
through
the
period
when
competitive
lacquers
had
appeared
and
when
the
government
says
they
should
have
made
some
switch,
and
he
testified
that
they
never
found
any
competitive
lacquer
in
buick
to
take
up
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh,
yes.
there
was
a
--
a
period,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
the
1920s
when
they
bought
100%
of
their
topcoats
from
du
pont
because
they
--
the
research
people
wouldn't
approve
full
range
of
colors
made
by
anybody
else.
then,
the
time
came
in
1926.
they
were
all
--
at
that
time,
they
were
constantly
trying
to
find
competitive
finishes.
they
approved
some
in
1926
and
then
these
divisions
began
to
split
up.
and
the
judges
made
--
at
least
his
findings
indicated
reliance
on
his
testimony
as
i
have
indicated.
now,
i
have
--
i
have
dealt
with
that
percentage
argument,
somewhat
in
more
length
than
i
have
intended
because
it
seems
to
me
the
only
argument
that
the
government
really
had
made
on
the
facts.
and
i
want
to
say
it
again
to
the
court
to
their
best
and
i
--
i'm
also
conscious
that
i'm
doing
something
i
shouldn't.
i
am
arguing
this
case
to
this
court
as
if
i
were
in
the
district
court
and
of
course
that's
not
the
issue
here,
but
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
avoid
it.
but
i
remind
the
court
that
--
that
there
is
affirmative
testimony
in
this
record
about
why
these
purchases
were
made.
and
the
real
question
i
suppose
is
whether
the
inference
the
court
wants
to
--
the
government
is
trying
to
draw
from
the
percentages
will
overcome
that
testimony
and
show
that
these
findings
are
clearly
erroneous.
now,
even
if
i
had
to
concede
weight
to
the
inference
which
i
don't,
that
question
would
remain
but
we
think
the
inference
doesn't
really
have
any
weight
at
all.
the
--
thus
i've
been
explaining.
i'd
like
to
say
this
too
before
i
leave
the
matter
of
the
percentages
which
is
really
a
repetition
in
effect
of
something
i
said
to
--
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
the
government
also
attacks
findings
as
to
other
commodities.
it
attacks
all
these
purchases.
the
purchases,
the
refrigerator
paint,
the
purchases
of
the
antifreeze
and
the
purchaser
and
the
purchases
of
casehardening.
now,
i
have
explained
about
dulux.
in
the
case
of
the
antifreeze,
the
record
shows
that
only
20%
of
du
pont's
purchases
or
sales
are
made
to
general
motors.
there's
a
table
in
the
record
about
it
and
the
percentage
varies
from
time
to
time.
it
may
go
up
from
that
but
it's
--
it's
--
i
think
roughly
in
a
20%
to
30%
range.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
this
--
this
--
in
the
case
of
antifreeze
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
this
is
--
these
are
the
general
sales
at
antifreeze
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
put
in
automobiles
which
is
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
the
same
thing
that
--
and
the
antifreeze,
mr.
justice
warren,
i
should
explain,
that
is
sold
to
the
general
motors
is
sold
for
resale
so
that
there,
the
comparison
really
is
i
think
on
the
same
basis.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
--
in
the
division
of
our
laborers
in
this
case,
mr.
stern
is
going
to
handle
that
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
but
i
--
i
can't
--
well,
i
won't
--
i'd
like
to
talk
about
it
but
i
will
--
got
to
go
ahead.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
i
was
about
to
mention
some
of
those
in
connection
with
this
point
i
was
making
about
their
attack
on
the
findings.
the
chemicals
are
one
thing
and
would
fall
in
that
--
i
mean
particularly
the
case
--
these
case-hardening
chemicals
which
are
used
to
harden
gears
and
things
of
that
kind.
now,
the
facts
on
those
are
that
we
sell
--
du
pont
sells
far
more
to
other
automobile
manufacturers
just
looking
at
them
than
it
does
to
--
to
general
motors,
for
example
ford,
i
think
it
buys
something
like
70%
of
its
requirement
to
something
from
du
pont
and
buys
more
of
those
case-hardening
chemicals
than
all
the
general
motors
division
put
together
to.
that's
one
illustration.
another
illustration
is
in
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
their
--
i
have
those
figures
here,
some
place
in
the
45.
i
think
that
the
--
speaking
in
terms
of
our
--
the
percentage
of
du
pont
sales
that
are
made
into
different
groups,
about
20%
of
the
casehardening
sales
are
made
to
general
motors
and
i
think
about
56%
to
ford,
that's
the
relationship.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
oh,
that
percentage
i
think
is
around
25%
or
30%
in
that
--
that
neighborhood.
it
buys
the
balance
of
it
from
somebody
else.now,
there
are
other
commodities,
mr.
chief
justice
warren.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
in
the
chemical
field
particularly
in
anode,
they
--
which
we've
tried
to
sell
them,
they
buy
about
a
million,
three
of
anodes
in
1947
from
other
people
about
$2000
worth
per
month.
they
made
some
pretty
--
the
evidence
shows
some
pretty
strenuous
sales
efforts
there
with
no
success.
in
the
field
of
solvent,
for
example
in
1947,
which
is
another
important
chemical
product
which
is
--
might
think
the
du
pont
company
would
have
some
success,
they
sold
about
$400,000
to
general
motors
in
1947
and
it
bought
$300,000
from
somebody
else
--
$3
million,
i'm
sorry.
that
was
a
very
serious
mistake.
the
other
argument
that
the
government
makes
which
is
its
only
suggestion
here
in
support
of
its
attack
on
the
affirmative
evidence
that
these
purchases
are
made
independently
has
to
do
with
fisher
body.
and
i
should
like
to
some
--
say
something
very
briefly
about
that.
they,
as
mr.
davis
outlined
it
to
you
this
morning,
take
the
position
that
for
many
years,
fisher
body
was
operated
within
general
motors
with
a
considerable
degree
of
independence.
and
mr.
--
the
government
attributes
that
to
the
character
and
personality
of
the
fisher
brothers.
that
is
a
point
of
view
which
we
embrace
and
it's
a
principle
we
would
like
--
and
we
apply
it
more
widely
in
this
situation.
there,
general
motors
had
complete
voting
control
of
fisher
brothers
and
yet
the
government
itself
recognizes
that
this
question
of
control
as
is
proved
depends
on
the
people
that
were
involved.
now,
the
government
says
that
there
was
a
long
period
of
time
when
they
were
independent
and
that
while
they
were
independent,
they
didn't
buy
anything
and
not
very
much
from
du
pont
or
at
least
not
as
much
as
the
other
division
did.
and
then
a
time
came
when
the
--
a
loss
to
independence,
they
now
say
that
was
when
the
fishers
retired
about
1944.
and
then,
the
government
says
there
was
a
change
in
the
pattern
with
purchase.
now,
each
step
really
in
that
argument,
except
for
the
concession
that
the
fisher
brothers
were
independent,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
incorrect
and
not
supported
by
--
by
the
record.
in
the
first
place,
it
isn't
true
that
before
1944,
fisher
didn't
buy
very
much
from
du
pont.
as
the
table
and
their
statistics
in
the
record
which
indicate
when
you
put
them
together
that
in
a
10-year
period,
between
about
1927
to
i
think
the
end
of
1936,
in
every
year,
fisher
bought
more
from
--
from
du
pont
than
all
of
the
other
divisions
of
general
motors
combined.
the
second
thing
that's
wrong
with
it
is
that
there
never
was
any
change
in
the
--
so
far
as
fisher's
independence
is
concerned.
and
there
is
an
uncontested
finding
by
the
trial
court
to
that
effect.
trial
court
found
that
fisher
at
all
times
exercised
freedom
in
making
its
own
purchases.
the
government
seems
to
read
that
finding
is
confined
to
some
period
before
1944,
but
that's
not
what
the
finding
says,
and
it's
accompanied
by
a
finding
in
which
the
court
--
further
finding
in
which
the
court
says,
“the
evidence
requires
me
to
reject
the
charge
that
fisher
is
--
is
a
captive
market
for
du
pont.”
so
that
their
attempt
--
and
let
me
add
this
that
those
findings
are
fully
supported
by
the
evidence.
the
evidence
shows
that
after
1944,
fisher
bought
from
du
pont
in
just
the
same
way
that
it
did
before.
the
only
suggestion
that
the
government
ever
made
in
its
briefs
that
has
any
difference
was
a
--
an
erroneous
figure
which
it
produced,
which
said
that
in
1947
and
1948,
fisher
was
buying
i
think
65%
or
70%
of
its
fabrics
from
du
pont.
well,
the
trial
court
again
made
an
uncontested
finding
that
in
1947
on,
fisher
bought
between
37%
and
45%
of
its
fabrics
from
du
pont
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
shows
that
those
percentages
don't
differ
significantly
from
the
percentages
before
1944.
so,
that
the
fisher
argument
really
gives
them
no
part
at
all.
now,
with
this
--
this
affirmative
evidence
in
the
record,
there's
been
no
preference
or
favoritism.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i'm
going
to
talk
about
that,
i
hope.
i
just
want
to
say
this
that
this
--
this
evidence
about
how
the
divisions
have
bought
that
they
haven't
bought
from
du
pont
when
they
didn't
want
to,
but
when
they
did
buy,
they
had
a
good
business
reason
for
buying,
it
has
driven
the
government
to
--
to
take
a
position
which
i
think
deserve
some
comment,
particularly
in
view
of
the
evidence.
on
page
20
of
their
reply
brief,
they
now
redefine
the
strength
in
somewhat
different
terms
than
they've
ever
said
defined
it
before.
and
i
--
that
i
think
makes
it
necessary
for
me
to
say
a
word
about
it.
we
didn't
really
deal
with
this
--
it
might
have
been
our
main
brief.
they
say
in
the
middle
of
page
20,
"we
only
argue
that
where
a
du
pont
product
was
competitive
for
the
products
to
other
manufacturers
or
where
du
pont
was
on
a
competitive
basis
as
capable
of
performing
some
service
as
any
other
company,
then
the
du
pont-general
motors
relationship
took
the
place
of
competition
to
determine
the
flow
of
trade."
that
statement
is
interesting
for
one
reason
at
least
because
it
--
it
seems
on
any
basis
to
concede
that
this
--
even
on
their
terms,
taking
their
full
statement
of
the
case,
this
relationship
did
not
immunize
du
pont
from
the
--
from
the
competition.
it
didn't
have
any
kind
of
absolute
control
over
price.
it
didn't
have
any
power
to
exclude
competitors.
but
that's
not
--
i'm
not
interested
in
arguing
the
law,
part
of
it
now.
what
i
should
like
to
say
is
this,
that
if
that
statement
means
anything,
it
seems
to
me
in
something
like
this
that
if
everything
was
about
equal
or
if
there
was
any
reason
to
do
otherwise,
then
perhaps
du
pont
in
some
cases
and
to
some
extent
got
some
kind
of
a
preference.
now,
even
when
you
state
their
case
in
that
vague
and
attenuated
way,
the
evidence
in
the
record
won't
support
it.
and
i
--
i
should
like
just
to
--
i
can
only
do
this
by
example
and
i
can't
give
you
the
flavor
of
the
record,
but
here
are
some
examples.
in
1920,
chevrolet
was
using
some
fabrics
for
a
panel
board
in
a
car.
du
pont
came
along
and
said,
“we
can
--
we
can
make
a
better
panel
board
from
--
than
that
and
we
can
--
we
can
do
it
and
sell
it
to
you
to
a
price
half
what
you're
paying,”
and
chevrolet
said
"all
right."
and
they
did
it
and
they
sold
it
to
them
at
half
the
price.
they
had
the
business
for
a
year
i
think
or
two
years.
and
then,
a
competitor
came
along
and
got
hold
of
one
of
these
things
and
of
course
he
was
able
to
imitate
it.
the
man
who
had
been
supplying
chevrolet
before
and
he
came
back
and
said,
"give
me
back
the
business.
i'll
do
it
for
you
with
the
same
price
du
pont
does,"
and
he
got
the
business.
now,
there
was
something
that
du
pont
made
and
reduced
the
price
and
let
them
have
the
business
for
a
year
and
then
they
took
it
for
some
reason
of
their
own,
perfectly
proper
and
gave
it
back
to
them
but
it
certainly
indicate
there
wasn't
any
preference.
now,
here's
another
example.
one
of
the
important
commodities
in
the
fabric
still
involved
in
this
case
is
something
called
'teal'
which
is
--
used
to
be
used
for
tops
of
your
closed
cars
and
it's
also
used
for
the
tops
of
convertibles.
fisher
was
buying
teal
from
du
pont
and
from
somebody
else.
i
think
about
half
and
half
on
1931
and
it
said
to
these
two
suppliers,
"we
want
you
to
guarantee
that
this
fabric
you're
selling
us
will
not
fade,
shrink
from
cleaning
for
a
period
of
two
years."
and
the
competitor
said,
"all
right,
we'll
give
you
the
guarantee,"
but
du
pont
took
the
two
fabrics
off
its
own
--
its
competitors
and
it
tested
them
and
it
found
that
they
wouldn't,
either
one
of
them
really
stand
up
to
two
years.
and
it
came
back
and
said,
"we
don't
think
we
can
really
properly
give
you
that
guarantee,"
and
the
other
fellow
got
the
business.
du
pont
worked
on
the
fabric
for
two
years.
it
developed
the
fabric
that
it
could
give
a
guarantee
for
it
and
it
came
back
and
said,
"now,
we
--
we'll
give
you
the
guarantee.
we've
got
a
fabric."
fisher
says,
"no,
we're
not
interested.
we're
going
to
keep
on
giving
all
of
these
orders
to
this
other
man,"
and
they
did.
now,
those
--
those
examples
can
be
duplicated.
we
--
du
pont
has
tried
to
sell
seat
fabrics
to
general
motors
truck
and
coach
division
and
the
--
the
record
shows
that
they're
as
just
good
as
the
one
they
get
to
some
place
else,
but
they
won't
buy
them.
they
say,
“we're
not
interested
in
changing.”
i
recall
one
exhibit
here
on
the
anodes
that
i
spoke
to
the
chief
justice
about.
they've
been
--
a
salesman
is
going
around
trying
to
sell
anode.
this
is
a
document,
they're
trading
for.
he
went
to
cadillac
and
he
said,
"won't
you
buy
our
--
our
anodes?”
and
the
cadillac
engineer
said,
"well,
i
have
ordered
some
of
them
and
i'm
going
to
find
out
whether
they
are
any
different
from
the
ones
i've
been
buying
from
the
revere
copper
company
and
if
they
aren't
any
different,
i'm
going
to
continue
to
buy
revere's."
now,
there's
just
no
basis
in
this
record
in
saying
that
the
du
pont
got
a
preference
even
when
you
--
their
products
were
competitive
or
nearly
equal.
these
decisions
were
made
in
these
separate
divisions
in
the
ordinary
way,
probably
the
only
way
they
could
be
made,
an
enterprise
of
this
size
on
ordinary
--
on
an
ordinary
business
basis.
there's
a
--
a
fascinating
story
in
its
record
about
a
man
trying
to
sell
plastics
to
the
general
motors
divisions
to
be
used
in
making
steering
wheels
and
he
--
he
never
won
--
here,
he
got
a
quarter
of
the
business
but
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
--
never
could
get
anymore
and
he
lost
that
and
he
finally
went
to
pontiac
where
they
were
--
they
were
being
fabricated
in
one
divisions
and
he
--
used
by
pontiac
and
he
went
to
pontiac
and
there
was
a
contemporaneous
document
on
this.
it
said,
"please,
can't
you
give
me
some
help
on
getting
this
plastics
business?"
and
the
man
from
pontiac,
and
this
is
in
the
document,
said
"i
don't
give
a
damn
whether
you
use
your
plastic
or
the
plastic
of
one
of
your
competitor.
you
go
back
and
see
the
--
the
other
fellow,"
and
he
never
got
--
he
never
got
his
orders.
if
you
look
at
this
record
and
i
--
i
--
it's
hard
to
convey
what
it
means,
but
if
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
the
ordinary
days
that
they
conduct
the
business,
examine
the
testimony
and
look
at
these
documents
and
show
how
this
--
this
enterprise
was
carried
on.
it's
not
a
question
of
this
finding
being
clearly
wrong.
it's
really
a
question
whether
a
reasonable
man
could
reach
any
other
conclusion
on
the
basis
of
all
this
evidence.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
reed,
i
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
will
--
i
think
mr.
stern
may
talk
about
it
but
i
will
say
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
in
35
years
before
trial
and
this
maybe
a
too
simple
approach.
but
if
in
35
years
before
--
during
the
--
they
entered
in
35
years,
there
hasn't
been
any
restraint
of
trade.
they
have
had
no
preference.
then
--
then
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
if
you're
speaking
of
a
continuing
effort,
all
of
that
during
that
time
was
a
continued
resistance
by
general
motors.
that
proposes
a
somewhat
different
problem.
but
i
would
say
as
to
that
that
if
you
make
the
assumption
if
there
was
power
to
get
the
preference
and
the
intent
to
get
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
not
power.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
and
i
--
i
say
as
to
the
intent
in
the
first
place
that
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
intent
to
get
--
to
--
to
enjoy
any
preferred
position.
now,
i'm
aware
that
the
raskob
document
and
i
hope
to
say
something
about
that
because
i
think
that
is
the
most
--
the
most
--
the
best
piece
of
evidence
really
in
this
case
the
government
has.
i
sometimes
thought
if
they
didn't
have
that
document,
they
wouldn't
have
a
case.
but
taking
at
--
at
full
weight,
let's
suppose
that
mr.
raskob
thought
in
1917
that
if
they
bought
the
stock,
they
would
in
some
way
get
an
advantage
in
the
trade.
i
suggest
that
if
in
the
35
years
that
hasn't
happened,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
and
if
he
had
the
intent
to
exercise
that
power,
that
would
raise
a
different
question.
but
as
to
that,
mr.
justice
reed
in
transposing
it
without
conceding
your
assumption
of
fact
because,
let
me
say
here
if
incase
i
don't
get
to
the
raskob
document,
that
we
accepted
that
document
for
what
it
is
on
its
face
which
is
a
statement
of
an
expectation
that
the
stock
alone
in
some
way
would
get
du
pont
an
advantage.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
influence.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
we
do
not
accept
it
as
evidence
that
mr.
raskob,
much
less
the
du
pont
company,
intended
to
exercise
any
power
that
the
stock
gave
it
to
require
or
compel
or
indirectly
control
the
freedom
of
general
motors.
there's
a
difference
between
those
two
things.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
--
what
i'm
speaking
of
in
all
those
three
words
is
the
power
to
impose
your
will,
directly
or
indirectly
on
someone
else,
so
that
he
doesn't
act
with
complete
freedom.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
may
be
a
violation
in
--
if
it
happens,
but
in
terms
of
intent,
i
think
it
is
reduced
to
a
mere
kind
of
expectation,
mr.
justice
reed.
if
they
got
a
preference,
then
the
fact
that
he
anticipated
it
i
think
would
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
contend
that
he
didn't
contend
it.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
well,
you've
got
to
be
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
now,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
conspiracy
case
where
--
and
--
but
--
again,
i
look
--
it
seems
to
me
if
you
look
at
this
thing
in
--
in
terms
of
common
sense
or
in
simplified
terms,
if
raskob,
when
he
made
that
prophecy
or
whatever
he
has
taught,
he
may
have
been
right
--
he
might
have
been
right,
he
might
have
been
wrong.
it
turns
out
he
was
wrong.
the
fact
showed
he
was
wrong.
there
hasn't
been
any
restraint
of
trade.
now,
really
that
on
--
on
a
basis
of
common
sense
and
in
terms
of
what
this
statute
was
supposed
to
do,
that
should
be
the
end
of
this
matter.
there
shouldn't
be
any
--
any
problems
about
these
metaphysical
problems
about
intent
and
--
and
control
and
that's
--
that's
what
happened
here.
and
the
difficulty
i
think
that
the
government
has
is
it
cannot
rid
its
mind
of
the
natural
preconception
that
somebody
might
have
approached
this
case
without
knowing
the
facts
in
finding
out
what
really
happened.
now,
i
should
like
to
go
ahead
deal
very
briefly
with
--
with
tetraethyl
lead.
i
have
had
to
curtail
the
examples
i
wanted
to
give
to
show
that
we
didn't
get
any
preference,
but
they're
in
the
record
in
the
brief.
the
government
makes
two
points
about
lead
and
i
want
to
deal
with
both
of
them
if
i
can.
one
of
them
is
that
the
fact
that
du
pont
was
chosen
to
manufacture
tetraethyl
lead
shows
that
there
was
a
--
that
there
was
a
tend
--
some
preferences
given.
mr.
kettering
testified
without
any
qualification
that
he
was
the
man
who
decided
to
call
in
du
pont.
now,
stopping
right
there,
there
are
some
contemporaneous
documents
that
corroborate
this
testimony
that
he
was
the
man
who
decided
it.
he
also
testified
that
the
reason
he
did
it
was
because
he'd
been
talking
to
du
pont's
for
--
off
and
on
for
years
about
some
of
the
chemical
problems
involved
in
tetraethyl
lead,
but
he
respected
their
capacity.
and
there
is
some
contemporaneous
documents
that
corroborate
that.
he
testified
explicitly
that
the
decision
to
call
a
man
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
was
not
influenced
in
any
degree
by
the
stock
relationship.
now,
there
isn't
any
document
to
contradict
that.
there
isn't
any
evidence
to
contradict
that.
the
judge
made
a
finding
on
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
finding
can
only
be
rejected
if
we
are
to
decide
that
mr.
kettering
is
unworthy
of
belief.
mr.
sloan
testified
that
he
approved
the
decision
and
he
told
why
he
did
it,
and
he
said
he
knew
what
du
pont
had
done
during
the
war
in
handling
dangerous
chemicals.
he
didn't
know
anyone
else
who
was
as
good
and
he
thought
they
were
the
ones
to
do
it.now
again,
nothing
that
impeaches
or
contradicts
that
testimony,
no
document.
this
is
not
gypsum
case
and
these
are
essential
facts
in
this
case.
there
aren't
any
--
there's
not
a
choice,
a
question
of
a
choice
between
--
between
conflicting
documents
and
conflicting
testimony.
so,
there
--
those
are
the
facts
about
how
that
decision
was
made
and
why
it
was
made.
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
this
morning
said
a
very
interesting
thing
which
i
would
like
to
comment
on
the
government.
let
me
say
this.we
should
remember
what
the
chemical
industry
in
this
country
was
in
1922.
we
really
didn't
have
any
of
it.
it's
a
development
after
the
first
world
war.
the
government
has
never
suggested
in
this
case
even
by
way
of
conjecture,
the
name
of
a
company
who
would
have
been
better
qualified
or
equally
qualified
or
even
the
name
of
any
company
who
would
have
been
interested
in
doing
it.
they
had
mr.
kettering
and
mr.
sloan
there
and
they
cross-examined
them.
they
didn't
ask
them
about
any
companies.
it
was
--
if
there
had
been
no
stock
relationship,
if
you
consider
the
experience
that
du
pont
had
had
in
making
explosives
and
particularly
if
you
consider
the
subsequent
efforts
that
they
did
make
to
get
other
chemical
companies
to
do
this,
the
choice
is
--
is
perfectly
reasonable.
and
certainly,
there
is
no
basis
for
rejecting
the
findings
in
the
absence
of
some
kind
of
testimony
that
mr.
kettering
and
mr.
sloan
testified
a
falsehood.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
roughly,
the
arrangement
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
roughly,
the
arrangement
was
this,
mr.
justice
reed,
and
from
about
1922
until
1937,
du
pont
made
tetraethyl
lead
and
sold
it
to
--
to
the
ethyl
corporations.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
it
was
a
patented
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes
or
ethyl
corporation
i
think
owned
the
patents.
i
believe
they
were
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
it
started
out
--
and
the
decision
in
1922
was
a
general
motors'
decision.
ethyl
was
not
organized
until
1924,
i
think.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
i
think
the
patents
went
to
the
ethyl
corporation.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
half
the
stock
and
the
jersey
company
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
owned
the
other
half,
a
vessel.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
du
pont
had
never
had
any
stock
in
ethyl
at
all.
its
relationship
was
just
a
manufacturing
and
selling
relationship
until
1937
when
it
became
a
manufacturing
agent
for
ethyl
and
didn't
sell
anymore.
and
then,
i
think
in
1946
to
1947,
ethyl
when
its
patent
expired,
ethyl
went
its
own
way.
and
today,
the
two
companies
are
manufacturing
and
selling
in
competition.
this
lead
situation
has
no
current
significance.
its
only
value
to
the
government
is
in
evidentiary
sense.
they
are
not
complaining
as
any
present
restraint
of
trade
about
lead
as
i
understand
it.
they
simply
say
it
proves
what
happened
in
the
past.
now,
just
let
me
say
this.
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
i
don't
think
the
--
i
don't
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
was
employed
is
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
was
employed
to
manufacture
the
tetraethyl
lead.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
was
--
it
sold
the
tetraethyl
lead
to
ethyl
corporation
and
made
its
profit
out
of
the
sale.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
from
the
sale
of
the
tetraethyl
lead
which
it
got
half
of
the
profits
of
tetraethyl
lead.
and
the
government,
i
--
the
--
well,
i
won't
go
into
that
but
that
was
the
nature
of
the
arrangement.
i
--
i
don't
think
the
government
charges
that
du
pont
took
the
patent.
i
think
it
charges
rather
that
we
seized
upon
the
opportunity
to
get
into
the
manufacturing.
perhaps,
somebody
else
might
manufacture.
that's
the
--
the
nature
of
the
charge
there,
i
think.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
they
did.
that's
the
contention
and
du
pont
did
make
money
out
of
it.
it
made
quite
a
lot
of
money
out
of
it,
mr.
justice
reed,
but
our
position
here
is
that
it
was
perfectly
proper
arrangement
made
for
the
reasons
that
mr.
kettering
and
mr.
sloan
said.
the
--
they
didn't
want
to
manufacture
this.
they
knew
they
would
--
it
was
dangerous.
they
wanted
a
chemical
company.
they
wanted
somebody
who
had
experience
in
handling
dangerous
commodities
and
they
chose
du
pont.
now,
by-and-by
they
made
arrangements
with
standard
to
manufacture
and
they
let
standard
start
out
with
the
same
size
plant
that
du
pont
started
out.
and
their
original
choice
of
--
of
--
du
pont
was
fully
justified
because
standard
unwisely
used
a
process
or
method
of
manufacturing
rather.
not
a
process
but
a
method
of
manufacturing
that
du
pont
saw
and
said
to
them,
“you'd
better
not
do
this.
this
is
dangerous.”
and
they
went
ahead
and
they
--
there
was
a
disaster
in
that
plant
which
they
poisoned
the
entire
working
force.
and
that
cured
the
--
by
and
large
cured
the
jersey
company.
they
didn't
want
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
manufacture.
they
continued
in
distributing
them.
now,
it's
quite
true
what
mr.
davis
says
that
there
were
people
killed
in
the
--
in
the
du
pont
plants
but
the
significant
thing
about
that
disaster
is
that
--
that
it
--
it
was
a
thing
that
--
that
kept
the
jersey
company
thereafter
for
manufacturing.
it's
also
significant
that
du
pont
never
did
anything
in
the
same
kind
the
jersey
company
did.
no
two
accidents
in
the
du
pont
plants
ever
happened
for
the
same
reason.
they
never
--
never
poisoned
an
entire
staff
of
the
factory
because
they
--
they
did
it
carefully
and
gradually,
but
i'd
really
think
that
sense
[laughter]
but
--
i
think
that
it
would
pass
[laughter].
i
appear
that
i
misspoke.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
i
think
that
if
you
could
read
the
documents
and
the
testimony
of
mr.
kettering
and
mr.
sloan
that
that
would
be
quite
understandable.
mr.
kettering
had
been
dealing
with
these
people
and
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
quite
as
informal
as
mr.
davis
suggest.
the
--
i
think
first,
mr.
irenee
du
pont
went
out
and
visited
with
mr.
kettering
the
laboratory
in
dayton
and
there
were
some
arrangements
made.
it
was
--
it
is
true
that
the
arrangements
initially
were
made
without
the
execution
of
a
formal
contract
and
we
don't
dispute
that,
but
i
don't
believe
that
fact
quite
bears
the
significance
that
mr.
davis
tries
to
put
on
it.
and
certainly,
it
doesn't
establish
really
that
the
choice
was
dictated
or
controlled
by
preference.
i
think
it's
--
if
you
read
the
testimony
and
look
at
the
documents,
particularly
the
contemporaneous
documents,
i
think
you'll
get
a
very
different
impression
to
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
well,
we
can't
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
no,
we
can't
deny
that
in
that
period
from
1920
to
1923,
mr.
pierre
s.
du
pont
was
president
of
--
of
general
motors
and
of
course,
he
did
sign
it.
and
if
that
--
if
that
fact
overcomes
the
testimony
of
mr.
kettering
and
mr.
sloan
about
why
this
thing
was
done,
they
were
the
people
who
really
made
the
decision.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
mr.
p.s.du
pont
really
had
any
active
part
in
it.
it's
that
formal
fact
that
he
signed
the
contract,
overcomes
that
testimony.
i
fear
we
have
no
answer
to
it.
but
again,
i
think
if
you
read
the
testimony
and
look
at
the
document
and
consider
that
--
that
formal
of
that
act,
it
becomes
clear
that
there
wasn't
any
--
there
wasn't
really
any
lack
of
arms-length
duty.
there
are
other
documents.
i
must
say
this,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
in
this
record
which
shows
that
mr.
p.s.
du
pont
was
highly
scrupulous
when
he
was
president
of
general
motors
in
dealing
with
these
intercorporate
relationships.
and
there
is
either
--
even
documents
written
to
him
by
the
people
in
this
one
document,
i
remember
in
the
du
pont
company,
which
shows
the
consciousness
of
the
fact
that
they
couldn't
expect
him
to
do
anything
for
them
while
he
was
president
of
general
motors.
those
are
not
contrived
after
--
as
they
were
written
25
years
ago
and
i
think
genuine
expressions
of
the
attitude
of
which
these
men
were
in
discharging
their
responsibility.
again,
i
think
if
you
look
at
all
those
things
together,
you
get
a
very
different
impression.
i
can
understand
why
mr.
davis
would
think
it's
--
it's
clear
but
of
course
things
of
that
kind
is
sometimes
done
in
business
here
or
inference
were
made
on
that
basis.
and
certainly
in
this
case
record,
i
think
you
loose
any
doubt
that
it
might
be
clear.
it
is
not
impossible
for
me
in
the
time
that
i
have
because
i
want
to
reserve
time
for
mr.
sloan
to
deal
as
fully
with
the
question
of
intent.
as
i
should
like
to,
i
have
intended
to
speak
about
more
details
about
mr.
raskob.
i
think
i've
said
as
much
as
i
shall.
i
do
want
to
say
this
that
there
are
--
those
--
there
are
two
letters
in
this
record
and
only
two
letters
in
which
a
man
in
du
pont,
writing
to
somebody
in
general
motors,
referred
to
the
stock
as
a
means
--
in
connection
with
a
sales
effort.
those
are
the
two
letters
that
mr.
davis
mentioned
that
lammot
du
pont
wrote
to
the
fisher
brothers
back
in
1922
or
1923.
now,
there
are
some
letters
inside
general
motors
referring
to
the
stock
and
i
think
there's
one
--
one
or
two
letters
inside
du
pont
intra-company.
but
those
two
letters
from
lammot
du
pont
are
the
only
two
letters
at
the
time
in
the
record,
34
years
and
i
invite
the
court
to
read
those
letters
because
i
think
they
don't
really
bare
the
--
quite
the
construction
which
the
government
puts
on.
it's
truly
mentioned
to
stop
but
hardly
enough
he
mentioned
it
when
he
made
much
of
it
in
this
kind
of
a
context.
he
said,
“you
really
ought
to
buy
from
us.
we're
a
stockholder
and
you
can
be
sure
that
we
will
give
you
the
best
possible
treatment.
we'll
give
you
a
preference
over
other
people
because
we
do
own
the
stock.”
it's
also
perfectly
clear
from
those
letters
that
he
recognized
that
he
had
to
sell
paint
and
that's
what
he
was
talking
about
on
the
merits
because
the
whole
burden
of
the
letters
except
for
the
--
the
reference
stock
was.
“what's
wrong
with
our
paint?
what
can
we
do
to
improve
it
to
make
it
satisfactory
to
you?”
now,
there
is
one
more
to
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
he
said
--
i
think
what
he
was
thinking
of,
mr.
justice
black
and
i
think
the
text
bears
this
out
that
if
you
should
get
into
a
position
where
there
was
short
supply,
this
is
pretty
clear
from
the
letter.
he
said,
“we'll
--
we'll
take
care
of
you
as
against
everybody
else
except
somebody
else
in
general
motors.”
he
thought
he
was
thinking
ahead
of
the
time
sometime
and
they
wouldn't
--
perhaps,
there
would
be
a
shortage
of
paint
or
something
of
that.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
i
don't
believe
it
did
because
i
understand
that
the
government
--
that's
one
thing
the
government
doesn't
charge
us
with.
they
don't
say
that
there's
anything
--
that
we
gave
any
preference
--
that
du
pont
gave
any
preference
to
general
motors
or
did
anything
wrong
that
it
would
raise
some
questions.
and
one
more
thing
that
i
--
i
should
like
to
say
because
i
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
justice
reed,
i
am
--
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
--
that
if
it
restrain
trade
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
would
be
a
combination.
i
don't
--
i
think
there
maybe
some
questions
about
it,
but
my
--
my
stand
today
is
on
the
fact.
there
is
one
more
incident
which
because
i
think
it's
a
kind
of
an
epitome
of
the
government's
case
that
i'm
going
to
call
the
court's
attention.
it's
something
that
mr.
davis
talked
about,
and
i
--
i
think
it
will
serve
to
illustrate
and
make
my
point
finally.
he
talked
about
mr.
pratt
and
he
talked
about
a
letter
that
mr.
pratt
wrote
to
somebody
in
delco-light
about
paint,
and
that's
a
pretty
good
letter
from
the
government's
point
of
view.
if
i
were
in
there
to
choose,
i
would
--
would
emphasise
it
too.
now,
in
that
letter,
it
was
quoted
two
or
three
times
i
think
in
their
brief.
mr.
pratt
said
in
effect,
“du
pont
came
to
the
rescue
of
general
motors
in
1920,
and
they
prevented
this
company
from
going
into
receivership,”
which
is
true
by
the
way.
and
i
think
if
all
other
things
are
equal,
probably,
they
ought
to
get.
if
they
can
get
it
on
the
basis
of
price
quality
and
service,
they
ought
to
get
a
part
of
the
business,
major
part
of
the
business.
that's
the
letter,
and
mr.
davis
says
it's
like
an
iceberg
and
it
is
like
an
iceberg
in
that
one
respect
that
there's
a
great
deal
beneath
it
that
i'd
like
to
tell
you
about
because
i
--
i
think
it
illustrates
the
danger
of
dealing
in
this
case
in
fair
fragments
which
is
--
i
think
the
tendency
the
government
have.
here
is
what
happened
in
that
case.
delco
was
buying
a
varnish
from
a
competitor
of
du
pont's
and
it
was
spraying
all
around
on
some
appliances.
it
changed
its
method
of
operation
and
had
the
dip
in
this
product
it
was
getting
from
the
competitors,
it
didn't
work.
so,
they
--
they
heard
that
chevrolet
was
doing
some
dipping
and
they
said
to
chevrolet,
“where
do
you
get
your
paint?”
said
du
pont.
they
asked
du
pont
if
it
could
develop
a
paint
and
said
it
could
and
it
did.
it
developed
a
paint
that
would
dip.
and
delco
gave
them
an
order
for
one
carload,
and
before
they
could
deliver
the
carload,
they
got
a
telephone
call
or
wire
from
delco
saying,
“don't
deliver
it.
we
have
decided
we'll
give
our
old
supplier
a
chance
to
do
this,
get
this
business
anyway.”
and
then
mr.
elms
who
was
an
old
personal
friend
of
mr.
pratt
has
told
he
had
been
treated
unfairly.
so,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
mr.
pratt
and
mr.
pratt
read
that
letter
over
the
telephone
to
mr.
bekaert,
a
man
in
delco
and
said,
“what
about
this?
and
then
mr.
bekaert
wrote
back
and
he
said,
“well,
here
is
the
situation,”
and
he
explained
it
and
he
said
in
his
letter,
“we
are
looking
into
it.
i
find
that
our
engineering
people
think
they
might
do
better
to
deal
with
du
pont."
and
then
he
wrote
another
letter
saying,
“we
find
out
we
can
buy
from
du
pont
more
cheaply
than
we
can
buy
from
this
local
supplier.”
and
then
what
happened?
well,
they
took
the
one
carload
from
du
pont
and
that's
all
that
business
du
pont
ever
got.
they
went
back.
they
went
back
to
the
old
supplier
and
continued
to
buy
from
him
from
that
time
on.
now,
that's
a
microcosm
in
a
sense
of
the
government's
case.
it's
got
everything
including
the
fact
that
mr.
bekaert
got
a
very
handsome
allotment
out
of
his
manager's
security
plan
that
the
government
says
would
influence
these
people.
and
we
have
mr.
pratt
writing
a
letter
and
yet
it
didn't
happen
and
that's
--
that
i
see
is
the
ultimate
comment
on
his
case.
now,
i
maybe
wrong
about
the
facts
in
this
case,
counsel
sometimes
are,
but
i
am
sure
the
facts
are
here.
and
as
i
conclude,
there
are
just
two
points
i'd
like
--
i'd
like
to
make.
we
submit
that
the
case
should
be
decided
on
the
facts.
you
think
it
should
be
decided
on
all
facts
and
not
just
part
of
the
facts,
the
fragments,
fragments
of
the
fact
and
it's
on
that
basis
that
we
submit
our
case
and
ask
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
to
be
affirmed.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
mr.
stern
is
going
to
discuss
the
clayton
act.
