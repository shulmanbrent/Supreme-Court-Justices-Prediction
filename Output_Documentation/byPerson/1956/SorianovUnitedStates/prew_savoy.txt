mr.
prew
savoy
prew
savoy,
for
the
petitioner.
mr.
prew
savoy
i
would
like
to
take
this
opportunity
to
thank
the
court
for
its
consideration.
after
the
situation
arose
in
november,
a
reason
of
the
maritima
case
below
which
was
there
involved,
we
were
to
present
the
original
issue
in
the
soriano
case.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
by
certiorari
to
the
court
of
claims.
now,
the
decision
in
the
soriano
case
was
based
upon
logronio
versus
united
states
in
which
that
court
held
that
the
guerrilla
activities
involved
in
the
philippines
did
not
produce
attack
of
the
united
states,
so
that
the
court
of
claims
had
no
jurisdiction.
my
argument
will
be
devoted
to
that
question
urging
that
a
debt
of
the
united
state
was
created
by
reason
of
the
guerrilla
activities
during
the
period
january
1942
to
january
1945
and
that
the
united
states
being
liable,
it
is
a
matter
of
which
the
court
of
claims
has
jurisdiction.
the
second
part
of
the
case
will
be
on
the
question
involved
in
the
maritima
case
which
will
be
argued
by
mr.
george
foley
where
the
court
below
which
had
held
for
some
five
years
that
the
six-year
limiting
statute
was
applicable
to
all
these
claims,
no
longer
applied
but
more
--
did
not
suspend
the
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
it
had
been
suspended
by
the
training
with
the
enemy
act
and
that
that
created
a
new
legal
disability,
so
that
it
fell
within
the
saving
provision
and
there
was
only
a
three-year
statute
of
limitation.
if
petitioner
is
correct,
the
simplest
file
in
the
court
of
claims
more
than
three
years
after,
the
claim
accrued
but
less
then
six
years.
if
the
maritima
case
is
correct,
then
since
it
was
filed
more
than
three
year,
thereafter,
the
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
the
two
cases
are
thus
interdependent.
the
specific
question
arising
on
open
grant
in
the
logronio
is
this,
a
filipino
civilian
furnish
supplies
and
equipments
to
organize
and
recognize
filipino
guerrillas
on
the
island
of
negros
who
were
acting
under
orders
of
general
macarthur
and
who
had
been
recognized
by
it.
the
requisitions
were
--
we
allege
by
u.s.
army
forces
officers
and
distinguished
from
u.s.
army,
the
regular
army
is
defined
in
section
ii.
they
gave
receipts,
promising
that
the
u.s.
army
would
repay
upon
its
promise
return
by
macarthur,
which
were
relied
upon.
it
was
a
meaning
of
demands
but
that
created
a
contract.
when
macarthur
returned
in
1944,
the
same
guerrillas
who
had
been
recognized
during
that
interim
period,
which
i
will
discuss
it
right
after
my
statement
but
we're
again
recognized
first
by
osmeńa,
commander
in
chief
of
the
philippine
army,
as
elements
of
that
army,
and
then
while
the
sixth
and
eighth
united
states
army
under
general
sutherland,
krueger
and
dunkel,
as
elements
of
united
states
army
forces
in
the
far
east
under
command
of
general
macarthur.
the
government
in
its
statement
for
question
has
left
out
reference
to
the
second
recognition
which
does
become
important.
now,
the
facts
are
simply
these,
and
there
--
there
is
no
general
disagreement
because
there
are
mainly
statutes
events
of
which
the
court
takes
judicial
notice
and
military
orders
which
are
in
the
appendices
to
the
extent
we
have
found
applicable.
from
1898
to
1946,
the
philippines
were
a
territorial
possession
of
the
united
states.
petitioner,
during
the
pertinent
dates
from
the
time
--
the
first
date
we
will
use
will
be
july
26,
1941,
he
was
a
national
of
the
united
states,
a
citizen
of
the
philippines,
residing
in
the
philippine
islands.
on
--
in
march
1934,
the
united
states
congress
has
a
--
a
--
an
independence
act
containing
12
obligatory
provisions
to
be
contained
in
the
constitution
of
the
commonwealth
of
the
philippines
until
they
became
independent
which
would
be
approximately
1946.
two
of
these
provisions
are
very
important,
and
one,
this
is
for
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
second,
it
provides
that
the
united
state
had
the
right
to
maintain
armed
forces
in
the
philippines
and
the
right
to
order
into
such
armed
forces
all
organized
military
forces
of
the
government
of
the
commonwealth
of
the
philippines.
a
constitution
was
adopted
in
1935
and
the
first
act
of
the
commonwealth
was
to
create
a
philippine
army.
as
japan
stated
to
surround
the
philippines
towards
the
middle
of
july
1941,
president
roosevelt,
on
the
recommendation
of
general
macarthur,
from
with
that
time
was
military
adviser
to
the
philippines,
issued
a
military
order
as
commander
and
chief
of
the
army
and
navy
of
the
united
states
and
which
he
called
an
order
into
the
service
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states,
all
the
organized
forces
of
the
commonwealth
of
the
philippines.
on
the
same
date,
he
created
through
the
war
department
what
we
call
usaffe,
united
states
army
forces
in
the
far
east.
macarthur
resigned
as
adviser,
he
was
made
a
brigadier
general,
he
was
placed
in
commanding
--
as
commanding
officer
of
usaffe.
in
october,
the
philippine
constabulary
was
--
by
orders
of
the
war
department,
induction
into
the
u.s.
army
forces
in
the
far
east,
december
18,
the
philippine
army
was
so
inducted.
they
were
the
predominant
troops
when
japan
landed
in
the
island
of
luzon,
mindanao
and
started
its
entry
into
the
philippines.
in
december,
very
obviously,
luzon
and
the
other
islands
could
no
longer
be
held,
and
our
troops,
on
their
way
right
immediately
moved
to
bataan
and
to
corregidor.
macarthur
stayed
until
march,
left
for
australia
but
not
without
further
giving
orders
with
respect
to
guerrilla
warfare.
it
was
this
group,
macarthur
had
under
him,
u.s.
army,
naval
units,
marines,
and
the
philippine
army,
all
of
these
are
part
of
usaffe,
no
foreign
troops,
all
in
our
army
forces.
true,
they
were
not
in
the
army
as
defined
but
neither
were
the
marines
or
the
naval
units,
they're
all
part
of
our
army
forces,
nonetheless,
fought
this
battle
there.
in
--
on
april
9,
king
surrendered
bataan.
on
may
7,
wainright
surrendered
corregidor.
col
refused
to
accept
the
surrender
because
wainright
would
not
surrender
all
u.s.
army
forces
in
the
far
east.
in
the
meantime,
wallace
arms
and
ammunitions
had
been
destroyed
at
corregidor
and
he
had
to
do
it
and
he
proceeded
to
try
to
get
other
generals
and
colonels
to
surrender.
you
will
find
in
appendix
as
attached
to
the
main
brief
--
the
typically
and
--
and
what
few
troops
he
got
to
surrender.
in
fact,
in
one
unit,
four
officers
and
men
surrendered.
in
another,
90%
of
one
battalion
and
none
of
three
others.
they
all
turned
in
the
hills
to
form
guerrilla
bands
which
they
did
with
great
success.
he
--
a
part
of
surrender
of
corregidor
and
finally,
on
june
9th,
a
date
not
--
not
often
in
used,
wainright
surrendered
what
he
had
left
and
could
surrender
of
general
sharp's
troops,
colonel
pugh's
troops
and
others.
but
he
had
great
difficulty,
and
as
i
say,
in
the
appendices
as
i
have
taken
from
three
army
publications,
published
by
the
department
of
the
army
since
the
war,
one
is
morton's
fall
of
the
philippines,
second
is
cannon's
or
smith's,
the
approach
to
the
philippines
and
the
third
is
leyte,
the
return
to
the
philippines
by
cannon.
and
they're
from
historical
documents
--
support
everything
which
we
have
found
in
these
miscellaneous
orders.
they
support
the
fact
--
and
the
philippine
army
did
not
serve
(inaudible),
they
were
inducted
into
it
and
was
part
of
our
army
forces.
on
page
2c
of
the
reply
brief,
i
reproduced
an
order
which
shows
that
certainly,
contemporaneously
--
mr.
prew
savoy
page
2c
sir.
mr.
prew
savoy
--
2c.
mr.
prew
savoy
on
the
first
paragraph,
and
it's
dated
may
15,
1942,
brought
us
the
term
when
wainright
was
trying
to
get
his
men
to
surrender.
beyond
his
trying
here
--
by
--
assumes
the
responsibility
of
commanding
officer
of
all
the
west
guerilla
quarters
in
the
honor
that
was
in,
and
that
a
personal
representative
of
general
douglas
macarthur
for
the
conduct
of
guerrilla
operations
and
incident
affairs,
this
is
in
accordance
with
verbal
instructions
from
general
macarthur
on
january
20,
1942.
though
there
are
three
periods,
the
first
period
i
have
covered
goes
to
this
date
of
may
1942.
that
is
a
period
when
the
philippine
army
was
part
of
the
u.s.
army
forces
as
such
and
before
they
surrendered.
the
second
period
starts
right
at
that
moment
with
the
organization
of
guerrillas.
the
first
order
i
was
able
to
find
was
this
one
and
it's
covered
the
middle
parts
of
luzon
(inaudible).
in
paragraph
3,
he
says
any
person
or
person
operating
as
guerrilla
in
the
name
of
the
u.s.a.
without
the
required
authority,
in
paragraph
2,
will
be
considered
as
enemy
of
the
u.s.
government.
as
time
went
on,
and
if
you
continue,
you'll
find
telegrams
to
(inaudible),
others
all
mentioned
in
one's
history,
and
these
tie
in
with
what
he
says
particularly
with
the
letter
of
february
13
1943
which
starts
at
page
6c.
lieutenant
commander
(inaudible)
of
the
u.s.
navy
was
apparently
very
well
trusted
by
macarthur
and
set
in
the
submarine
to
appoint
lieutenant
colonel
peralta
as
commanding
officer
of
the
6th
military
district
with
intelligent
next
to
be
spread
in
the
10th,
and
appointing
colonel
fertig
as
commander
of
the
10th
military
district
with
other
--
i
have
it
long
--
peralta
having
6th,
7th
and
8th
and
fertig
the
9th
and
10th.
during
all
of
this
period,
getting
messages
through
to
australia
was
extremely
difficult.
most
of
it
was
by
word
amount
with
this,
plus
what
--
i've
called
it
rather
informal
order,
a
directive
but
it
was
followed
because
in
all
10
districts,
colonels,
others
were
brought
up
in
rank
to
held
those
as
commanding
officers
to
conduct
guerrilla
warfare.
that
guerrilla
nomination
gave
these
commanders
three
things,
the
right
to
communicate
with
headquarters,
the
right
to
put
out
script
to
pay
debts
with,
and
the
right
to
get
supplies
if
they
could
be
furnished
at
any
time
because
getting
supplies
to
them
was
extremely
difficult.
since
they
couldn't
get
the
supplies,
they
had
the
right
to
forge
and
take
it,
which
i
did,
but
of
course
cooperation
from
the
next.
this
period
went
on
until
october
1944,
that
is
the
second
period.
the
third
period,
president
osmeńa
returned
in
october
with
general
macarthur.
they
landed
on
the
island
of
leyte.
there,
the
first
headquarters
were
setup
and
the
return
promise
by
macarthur
started.
it
eventually
ended
and
surrender
on
september
2,
1945.
upon
arrival,
osmeńa,
commander
and
chief
of
the
philippine
army,
issued
an
order
number
21
which
called
into
the
philippine
army
as
elements
of
the
philippine
army,
the
various
troops
which
had
been
previously
recognized
in
that
second
period,
and
immediately,
now
this
was
done
on
approval
and
after
screening
by
the
6th
and
8th
armies
of
the
united
states,
it
wasn't
done
for
filipinos
for
philippines.
immediately,
they
were
reactivated
and
redrafted,
reinducted
into
the
u.s.
army
forces
in
the
far
east.
the
most
important
order
on
the
subject
is
at
pages
63
and
64
of
the
main
--
the
appendix
to
the
main
page
where
on
august
23,
1945,
in
order
to
the
commanding
general
u.s.
army
forces
--
mr.
prew
savoy
63b.
mr.
prew
savoy
and
you'll
find
there
that
fertig
was
recognized
as
head
of
the
10th
military
district
from
february
13,
1943,
the
date
of
that
letter
which
i've
read
from
the
reply
appendix.
peralta
was
6th
military
district.
peralta
had
given
over
the
leyte
command
to
congleton
who
was
decorated
by
macarthur
according
in
this
history
upon
the
return
of
macarthur.
and
on
the
island
of
negros,
colonel
salvador
abcede,
that
was
the
7th
military
district,
was
recognized
as
of
july
8,
1943.
so
that
from
1943,
until
the
termination
of
the
war,
all
these
men
had
in
mind,
as
to
me,
expressed
recognition
by
macarthur,
as
well
as
implied
recognition
to
which
i'll
shall
come
in
a
moment.
during
the
second
and
third
periods,
no
question
that
there
was
absolute
recognition
of
organized
guerillas,
there
were
odd
lot
parents
not
recognized.
there
were
many
not
mentioned
in
that
order
recognized
and
but
it
--
they
had
to
be
an
organized
band
under
a
leader
and
the
leader
had
to
be
recognized
and
was
by
macarthur
and
retroactively
to
the
day
in
which
the
guerrilla
operations
commenced.
now,
the
government
has
maintained
that
these
men
were
not
in
the
army.
my
argument
in
substance,
is
this
that
for
the
first
period,
they
were
inducted
in
our
army
and
were
no
different
than
a
marine.
but
as
the
requisitions
weren't
made
in
that
period,
i'll
recite
that
to
show
their
status
before
they
became
guerrillas.
it
does
not
become
a
focal
issue,
although,
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
ascertain
that
they
were
or
were
not
in
our
army
when
they
became
guerrillas
for
application
and
their
paid
conventions,
the
rules
to
land
warfare
and
the
requisition
act
of
1941.
now,
during
the
second
period,
i
maintained
that
under
the
hague
conventions,
which
i've
recited
in
my
main
brief,
and
the
rules
of
land
warfare,
any
american
officer
in
occupied
territory
under
the
existing
emergencies
in
the
philippines
and
the
absolute
right
recognized
by
all
the
signatory
nations
today
that
to
requisition
properly,
and
if
they
wouldn't
give
it
to
him
against
receipts
to
take
it
away
and
carry
on
the
military
operations.
i
maintain
that
the
rules
of
land
warfare
merely
quote
the
hague
conventions,
52
and
53,
and
make
them
part
of
the
rules
of
land
warfare.
and
he
tell
his
boys,
when
they
were
in
occupied
territory
in
military
operations
under
emergency
conditions
where
you
can't
cable
washington
or
macarthur
in
australia
or
get
any
other
authority,
you're
entitled
to
requisition.
and
if
they
won't
give
it
you
to
take,
try
to
pay
for
it
if
you
can,
if
you
can't,
give
them
a
receipt
which
promises
just
compensation
and
that's
it.
the
requisition
act
of
1941
is
nothing
but
a
reiteration
of
that.
it
is
quoted
and
as
an
appendix
and
it
merely
gives
the
president
of
united
states
the
absolute
right
and
power
to
requisition
under
emergency
conditions
during
world
war
ii.
now,
the
government
took
--
as
four
points,
i
might
say
that
the
government
in
that
reply
to
this
argument
on
the
hague
conventions,
the
rules
of
land
warfare
or
the
requisition
act,
whatsoever,
it
was
relegated
to
a
footnote
at
pages
46
to
47,
and
in
lieu
of
that,
the
government
spilled
out
its
theory.
the
first
theory
is
that
no
one
can
bind
the
united
states
upon
a
contract
of
procurement
unless
authorized
to
do
so.
i
cannot
disagree
with
that.
that
says
nothing
about
time
of
war
emergency
conditions
on
occupied
territory
and
the
case
is
cited
are
just
as
far
from
war
as
peace
can
be.
the
second,
that
there
is
no
allegation
that
authorized
the
officers
who
made
the
requisitions
were
expressly
authorized
to
make
the
requisitions,
well
i
can't
disagree
with
that.
macarthur,
who
was
their
chief,
didn't
authorize
them,
he
didn't
have
to.
in
the
presence
of
the
hague
conventions,
rules
of
warfare,
they
had
the
right,
i
didn't
have
to
say
he
as
now
organize
guerillas
and
troops
of
the
u.s.
army,
you
may
go
get
food
that
i
agreed,
the
were
no
one
expressly
authorize.
and
then
the
third
argument
goes
on
to
the
question
of
the
arrangements
so-called
between
the
united
states
and
the
philippines
army
that
go
to
show
that
the
philippine
army
was
an
individual
unit,
a
part
of
what
from
the
u.s.
army
forces.
well,
i
won't
go
into
it
at
length
because
my
brief
covers
it
quite
totally.
i
will
point
out
that
in
hh,
appendix
hh,
i
have
paralleled
the
sovereign
powers
returned
--
retained
by
the
united
states
against
those
we
gave
to
the
philippines
for
the
period
until
it
became
an
offense.
we
retained
all
sovereign
rights
impart
except
the
right
to
name
a
president,
legislature
to
pay
duties
to
the
united
states
or
excesses,
over
quotas
and
the
right
to
became
aliens.
that's
all.
we'll
retain
every
other
sovereign
rights
including
the
one
that
call
their
army
into
our
forces.
now,
they
enlighten
that
situation
to
our
situation
in
europe,
no
difference
than
the
french.
well,
i
can
just
see
the
united
states
ordering
the
french
army
into
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states,
and
further
naming
their
president
because
this
is
what
actually
happened,
while
the
constitution
first
permitted
the
six-year
term
election
by
the
filipinos,
this
was
amended
to
make
it
8
years.
but
as
the
8
years
approached,
manuel
quezon
and
osmeńa
were
in
the
united
states.
their
term
had
two
years
to
run
so
our
congress
in
a
--
a
joint
resolution
saying
not
withstanding
the
constitution
of
philippines,
we
name
new
president
and
the
vice
president
until
you
have
an
election
back
home
so
that,
that
made
osmeńa
when
quezon
died
the
next
year,
commander
in
chief
of
the
philippine
army
through
us
so
he
was
our
commander
in
chief.
i
can't
see
this
argument
of
the
great
sovereignty
we
gave
them.
a
second
one,
a
point
that
should
be
noted
is
that
the
benefits
we
gave
under
the
national
life
insurance
act
and
the
missing
persons
act
did
not
change
the
status
of
the
philippine
army,
these
are
the
--
the
american
act,
of
course
not.
it
was
a
recognition
of
their
status.
those
two
laws
were
applicable
only
to
persons
who
served
in
the
land
and
naval
forces
of
the
united
states.
the
filipinos
did
so
they
were
entitled
to
those
benefits.
that
is
changing
their
status.
it's
recognized
that
they're
in
our
land
and
naval
forces
in
our
troop.
congress
didn't
give
them
all
the
school
privileges
and
home
privileges.
but
remember,
when
the
--
these
privilege
were
given
for
national
life
insurance
act,
it
was
just
a
lot
of
months
before
they
became
independent
and
when
the
missing
persons
act
which
had
been
overlooked
was
brought
in,
it
was
after
they
were
aliens.
well,
i
think
we
were
quire
generous
and
it
was
by
reason
of
the
reorganization
of
their
status
that
we
did.
now
the
fourth
point
is
the
most
extraordinary
of
all
because
it
is
recognized
in
--
is
recognized
in
the
government
system,
a
brief
involving
the
statute
of
limitations
that
we
are
preceding
how
the
violation
of
just
compensation,
well,
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
government
constitution.
and
yet,
in
the
light
of
that,
this
court
has
asked
to
go
slow
in
deporting
from
the
view
of
the
executive
department
and
to
leave
this
matter
to
a
decision
by
the
executive
department
because
at
this
high
level
of
diplomatic
relations,
they
can
settle
these
cases
beautifully
without
the
help
of
the
court,
that's
the
fundamental.
there's
a
group
of
case
decided
with
which
i
can't
disagree
that
if
a
ship
comes
into
port,
there
is
a
certificate
from
the
department
of
state
that
the
ship
is
owned
and
operated
by
a
foreign
government,
our
courts
will
not
take
jurisdiction,
they're
immune
from
suits.
i
don't
what
that
has
to
do
with
a
contract
claim
against
the
united
states.
not
one
case
that
is
cited
has
anything
but
a
politically
flavor
as
so
clearly
on
a
surface,
there
can
be
no
doubt.
anyway,
it
is
my
concept
that
it
has
always
been
a
recognized
due
of
executive
as
well
as
the
judicial
branch
that
question
of
just
compensation
is
one
for
judicial
determination
and
a
judicial
function
and
this
court
should
not
be
as
abdicated.
second
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
seen
a
new
record
there,
the
government
taking
the
position
that
you
proceed
in
a
political
claim
or
any
claim
against
a
foreign
country
without
first
exhausting
your
judicial
remedy.
if
it
claim
is
presented
by
the
united
states
that
they
have
american
national,
one
fundamental
is
that,
if
we
established
that
that
claim
was
pushed
to
the
final
end
for
a
judicial
determination.
if
the
judicial
remedies
have
not
been
under
exhausted
argument
--
(inaudible)
nor
will
that
listens
to
a
claim
from
any
other
foreign
--
from
any
foreign
country
unless
the
judicial
remedy
have
been
exhausted.
now,
i
think
we
have
invoked
here
a
very
simple
matter.we
have
a
dollar
bill
which
is
worth
a
dollar
only
because
of
the
integrity
of
the
united
states.
it
is
no
difficulty
as
an
iou
then
a
script
which
these
guerillas
gave
the
filipinos
who
supplied
them.
it
was
a
promise
that
the
united
states
would
pay
like
authorized
officers.
the
united
states
has
not
paid
and
i
think
the
integrity
of
the
united
states
is
a
fully
involved
as
though
they
refused
to
furnish
a
dollar
worth
of
silver
for
this
certificate.
the
second
question
--
i
should
spend
a
very
little
time
on,
the
respondent
has
taken
and
suggested
that
counsel
for
petitioner
has
acted
with
impropriety
in
presenting
the
first
argument.
the
first
argument
is
that
the
claim
accrued
june
21,
1948,
that
that
question
was
not
argued
or
presented
in
the
--
in
maritima
case
and
that
i
had
no
right
to
present
it
here.
now,
if
that
is
true,
i
apologize
to
the
court
and
hope
that
you
will
ignore
the
argument.
i
don't
conceive
that
and
i
will
state
very
simply
why.
i
believe
that
before
you
can
determine
when
the
statute
is
running,
you
must
determine
when
it
began
to
run
when
the
claim
accrued.
that
is
why
i
put
that
in
because
i
thought
this
kind
of
a
claim
is
not
the
ordinary
kind
of
a
claim.
when
guerilla
requisition
claim
promised
to
pay
at
a
very
indefinite
date
in
the
future
on
macarthur's
return,
i
thought
that
the
old
rule
applied
by
the
court
of
claims,
you
must
first
present
your
claim
to
the
army
and
have
it
denied
before
you
can
sue
in
the
court
of
claims.
now,
if
i
am
right,
then
i
--
i
have
not
raised
an
issue
that
is
in
property
range.
the
question
is
so
simple
and
fully
covered
that
i
will
not
argue,
submit
it
and
i
hope
that
i
am
right,
but
if
i
am
not,
i
apologize
to
the
court
for
my
misjudgment.
mr.
prew
savoy
your
honor,
if
you
have
any
questions
