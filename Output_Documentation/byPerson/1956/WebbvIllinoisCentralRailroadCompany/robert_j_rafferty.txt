mr.
robert
j.
rafferty
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
rafferty
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
before
your
honors
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
directed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
petitioner,
mr.
john
webb,
was
the
plaintiff
in
an
action
brought
in
the
federal
district
court
in
chicago
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
against
his
employer,
the
illinois
central
railroad
company.
a
jury
returned
the
verdict
in
his
favor
in
the
amount
of
$15,000.
the
respondent
or
defendant
filed
the
usual
post-trial
motions
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
and
for
a
new
trial,
both
of
which
were
denied.
and
the
railroad
then
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
and
directed
that
judgment
be
entered
in
favor
of
the
railroad.
mr.
webb,
the
petitioner
was,
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
a
brakeman
in
the
employment
of
the
railroad,
had
been
employed
either
in
that
capacity
or
as
the
section
hand
for
approximately
25
years.
on
july
2nd,
1952,
his
duties
took
him
together
with
the
members
of
his
train
crew
to
the
community
of
mount
olive,
illinois.
and
at
that
point,
your
honors,
there
are
certain
tracks
which
are
involved
in
this
case
in
which
are
referred
to
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
if
i
may
direct
your
attention
to
a
photograph
at
page
112
of
the
record,
it
shows
the
track
layout
at
the
--
quite
in
question.this
document
was
the
defendant's
exhibit
which
was
submitted
by
agreement.
to
the
left
to
the
telephone
pole,
your
honors
will
see
a
track
which
is
the
i.c.
main
line
track.
the
track
in
the
foreground
--
incidentally,
you're
looking
at
the
picture,
you
are
looking
north.
the
track
in
the
foreground
which
shows
a
switch
lever
and
switch
stand
to
the
north
of
the
stand
is
referred
to
in
the
record
as
the
passing
track.
and
to
the
south
of
the
stand,
it's
referred
to
as
the
i.c.
house
track.
this
is
connected
with
the
i.c.
main
line
track
by
a
crossover
switch.
to
the
right
is
the
track
of
a
separate
railroad,
the
l.&
n.
railroad
and
your
honors
will
note
that
it
is
also
connected
with
the
i.c.
passing
track
and
the
i.c.
house
track.
it's
a
little
difficult
to
see
that
approximately
six
thigh
length
to
the
south
of
the
switch
stand
is
a
small
x
and
that
is
the
point
of
the
accident
in
this
case.
mr.
webb,
on
july
2nd,
1952
was
standing
at
a
point
approximately
15
or
20
feet
south
of
the
house
track
switch
when
he
observed
a
box
car
leaking
green,
and
it
was
his
duty
to
plug
up
that
leak
if
possible.
and
for
that
purpose,
it
was
his
intention
to
go
back
to
the
caboose
and
get
a
handful
of
ways
to
use
to
plug
up
this
hole.
he
turned
about
and
according
to
his
testimony
he
took
one
step,
he
put
down
his
left
foot.the
left
foot
was
caused
to
roll
underneath
him.
he
lost
his
balance.
he
fell
down.
and
on
the
ground,
he
observed
what
had
caused
him
to
fall.
it
was
the
clinker
which
he
described
as
about
this
size
in
appearance.
he
stated
that
at
that
time
he
observed
a
hole
indicating
where
the
clinker
had
been
before.
and
he
testified
that
the
roadbed
was
soft
and
left
footprints
as
he
walked
in
it.
now,
this
area
of
course
is
in
the
vicinity
of
a
switch
or
a
switch
stand
and
the
railroad
then,
that
is
a
place
where
good
footing
is
on
the
upmost
important.
they
get
on
and
off
moving
cars
at
that
point.
they
work
along
side
of
moving
cars
at
that
point.
approximately
three
weeks
to
a
month
before
this
accident
happened,
substantial
changes
had
been
made
by
the
i.c.
in
its
house
track.
prior
to
that
time,
the
passing
track
had
been
raised
and
within
three
weeks
to
a
month
before,
two
section
crews
were
put
to
work
on
this
mount
olive
house
track
and
they
raised
it
about
five
inches,
the
track,
the
ties
and
the
roadbed.
and
they
used
about
15
cubic
yards
of
unscreened
cinders
and
chat
in
order
to
raise
the
roadbed.
the
section
foreman
testified
that
the
source
of
his
material
was
a
pile
which
had
been
left
before
when
the
house
track
was
raised.
the
record
has
not
disclosed
how
long
this
pile
remained
in
the
vicinity.
the
plaintiff,
mr.
webb,
testified
that
it
was
also
a
customary
place
for
the
fireman
of
the
illinois
central
railroad
to
clean
their
fireboxes
at
this
point.
the
section
foreman
in
testifying
about
the
size
of
the
clinkers
which
were
in
this
pile
indicated
that
some
of
them
were
approximately
two
inches
in
diameter
but
he
said
efforts
were
made
to
exclude
clinkers
of
that
size.
the
evidence
on
the
record
also
shows
that
the
track
was
closed
for
a
use
of
the
trainman
during
the
time
the
repairs
were
being
made.
three
people
testified
with
reference
to
the
size
of
the
clinker
and
whether
or
not
it
would
constitute
a
proper
item
in
the
roadbed
ballast.
but
first
was
the
plaintiff,
mr.
webb
himself,
who
testified
that
he
had
been
a
former
section
hand
and
the
clinkers
of
this
size
should
not
be
used
in
a
railroad
roadbed
because
they
would
not
pack
down
and
would
not
give
good
footing.
the
next
man
who
testified
on
the
subject
was
the
defendant
section
foreman,
mr.
rector,
who
actually
supervised
and
conducted
the
repairs
of
this
location.
mr.
rector
testified
that
a
clinker
as
described
should
not
be
used
in
a
switch
stand
or
switching
area
near
a
switch
stand.
mr.
(voice
overlap)
and
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
rafferty
it
was
a
fist
size
one,
your
honor.
i
honestly
cannot
tell
you
whether
that
would
pass
through
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
rafferty
no,
we
don't
your
honor.
the
record
is
sound
in
that
respect
whether
or
not
that
would
pass
through
the
firebox.
i
submit,
however,
your
honor,
that
there
are
two
possible
sources
of
the
clinker,
the
pile
which
had
existed
before
and
which
by
the
railroad
submission
did
include
clinkers
of
two
in
size
which
would
be
somewhat
the
approximation
of
a
fist
and
also
the
possibility,
of
course,
of
them
having
come
from
a
firebox.
mr.
webb
gave
his
statement
from
the
--
to
the
railroad,
and
there
is
a
dispute
existing
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
or
not
the
clinkering
question
was
on
top
of
the
roadbed
partially
in
or
partially
out
of
the
roadbed.
the
confusion
arises
because
at
one
point
he
said,
he
did
not
notice
whether
or
not
the
clinker
was
in
or
out
of
the
roadbed.
i
do
believe,
however,
that
he
clarified
that
at
a
later
time
and
his
statement
which
was
admitted
in
evidence,
i
think,
also
clarifies
that
point.
it
appears
like
--
it
appears
at
page
111,
and
it
says,
"this
track
had
been
worked
on
shortly
before
this
by
the
trainman
and
the
cinders
were
stirred
up
and
loose.
and
this
large
clinker,
about
six
inches
in
circumference,
was
buried
in
the
loose
cinders
around
it
so
that
it
was
not
discernible
from
those
rests
of
the
small
loose
cinders.
it
looked
like
the
surface
was
leveled
and
good
enough
footing,
but
this
cinder
being
solid
in
the
loose
cinders
caused
my
foot
to
turn
as
i
stepped
on
it.
it
turned
my
foot
and
caused
me
to
fall.
so
that
i
injured
the
cartilage
in
my
knees
as
i
fell.”
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
from
the
record
as
disclosed
and
the
inference
is
favorable
to
the
plaintiff
at
this
stage.
he
fell
on
a
clinker
embedded
in
a
roadbed
near
the
railroad
switch
stand.
the
jury
could
have
found
that
the
source
of
the
clinker
was
either
the
old
pile
which
had
been
used
and
raised
in
the
house
track
or
a
clinker
from
the
respondent's
firebox.
the
jury
could
have
inferred
that
when
the
railroad
raised
its
roadbed,
five
inches,
a
matter
of
three
weeks
before
that
the
clinker
was
either
placed
in
the
roadbed
at
that
time
or
not
removed.
the
evidence
is
positive
that
the
area
or
that
the
materials
used
in
the
roadbed
were
not
screened.
from
that
evidence
the
jury
could
conclude
that
the
respondent
was
negligent
in
failing
to
furnish
a
safe
place
to
work.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
all
those
facts
and
recognized
that
there
was
a
possibility
to
use
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
clinker
was
embedded
in
the
railroad
roadbed.
but
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
went
far
beyond
the
record
and
neglected
to
tell
your
honors
that
in
looking
at
the
photographs,
you
will
see
in
the
distance
several
small
buildings,
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
144
in
the
record
and
its
opinion
referred
to
those
buildings.
it
referred
to
the
proximity
of
the
tracks
of
the
other
railroad
and
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
record
was
found
as
to
whether
or
not
strangers
frequent
of
the
premises.
and
therefore,
concluded
that
there
were
possibilities
that
the
respondent
was
guilty,
but
that
no
probabilities
could
be
deduced
from
the
evidence.
presumably,
because
the
plaintiff
had
not
negated
or
eliminated
the
possibility
that
the
l.&
n.
railroad
might
have
injected
a
clinker
in
some
manner
in
the
i.c.
roadbed,
presumably
because
it
was
possible
that
a
stranger
would
have
done
the
same
thing.
and
in
our
reply
brief,
i
referred
to
several
cases
which
at
least
in
my
opinion
eliminate
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
l.&
n.railroad
injected
the
clinker
in
the
roadbed.
for
the
reason
that
these
cases
hold
that
if
one
railroad
used
the
tracks
of
another
with
its
permission,
they
are
responsible
for
the
negligent
of
the
railroad
where
state
permit
to
use
their
tracks.
so
in
effect,
it
comes
down
to
this.
did
a
stranger
put
a
clinker
in
the
i.c.
roadbed
or
did
the
i.c.
railroad
or
it's
vice
principle,
the
l.&
n.
railroad
do
that?
i
submit
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
search
the
record
for
a
conflicting
circumstantial
evidence,
they
violated
the
mandate
of
this
court,
in
lavender
versus
kurn,
bailey
versus
central
vermont
and
an
innumerable
line
of
cases
which
had
been
handed
down
by
this
court.
as
recently
as
april
of
this
year
in
schulz
versus
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
the
question
of
the
--
of
a
lower
court
searching
the
record
for
conflicting
possibilities
came
before
the
court
and
with
the
court's
permission
i
will
quote
a
small
part
of
the
opinion
from
page
526
at
350
u.s.,
"the
courts
below
took
this
case
from
the
jury
because
of
a
possibility
that
schulz
might
have
fallen
on
a
particular
spot
where
there
happened
to
be
no
ice
or
that
he
might
have
fallen
on
a
particular
spot
where
there
happened
to
be
--
or
they
might
have
fallen
from
the
one
bolt
that
was
partially
illuminated
by
shore
lights.
doubtless,
the
jury
could
have
so
found
and
the
court
allowed
it
to
perform
its
function.but
it
would
not
have
been
compelled
to
draw
such
inferences.”
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
jury
could
and
did
find
that
the
i.
c.
railroad
was
negligent
in
furnishing
a
safe
place
to
work.
i
admit
the
possibility,
a
remote
one,
it
is
true
that
a
stranger
might
have
come
on
the
icy
roadbed
and
buried
a
clinker.
it's
the
most
unlikely
possibility,
but
it
could
exist.
that
was
a
question
for
the
jury
to
decide.
the
jury
found
adversely
to
the
respondent.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
raising
the
standard
of
proof
of
probabilities
as
opposed
to
possibilities.
instead
of
following
the
mandate
of
this
court
to
allow
the
jury
to
decide
if
the
inferences
were
reasonable,
where
the
conflicting
circumstantial
evidence
put
the
truth
and
it
was
in
further
error
when
it
substitute
its
own
interpretation
of
the
evidence
for
that
of
a
jury.
mr.
robert
j.
rafferty
i
have
only
several
points,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
j.
rafferty
--
i
would
like
to
raise.
your
honor
questioned
mr.
deany
with
reference
to
the
shoveling
of
the
cinders,
15
cubic
feet
into
a
cart
and
their
foreman
witnessing
each
shovel
full.
this
court
has
held
in
moore
versus
chesapeake
&
ohio
railroad
that
a
jury
may
credit
or
discredit
any
part
of
a
witness's
testimony
as
here
is
arriving
its
verdict.
and
certainly,
the
jury
would
not
be
required
to
believe
an
incredible
story
of
that
type
with
two
section
crews
working
there
that
the
headman
stands
there
and
watch
shovel
by
shovel.
he
also
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
certain
issues
were
withdrawn
from
the
jury.
paragraph
(4),
the
record
shows
that
paragraph
(5),
the
complaint
was
still
an
issue
in
the
case
when
the
case
went
to
the
jury.
and
prior
with
what
happened,
the

here
and
complained
of,
defendants

in

said
cinders.
that
was
an
issue
in
the
case
that
went
to
the
jury.
mr.
justice
reed
asked
the
question
with
reference
to
the
size
of
the
clinker
and
i
don't
think
anybody
would
be
better
fitted
to
state
whether
or
not
a
fist

clinker
did
or
did
not
belong
in
a
roadbed
in
the
defendants
own
supervisor.
mr.
(inaudible)
who
testified
at
page
87
of
the
record,
well,
i
asked
him
this
question,
"in
your
opinion,

a

the
size

embedded
in

cinders
adjacent
to

stand
represent
a
safe
place
for
a
train
to
work?"
his
answer
was
no.
reference
to
lavender
versus
kurn,
your
honor,
which
you
questioned
mr.
deany
about,
lavender
versus
kurn
with
two
defendants,
one
was
the
owner
of
illinois
central
railroad
and
made
the
same
defense
in
that
case
they
did
here,
speculation
and
conjecture.
the
court
ruled
against
him
and
held
those
were
matters
of
fact
for
the
jury.
if
a
reasonable
man
could
draw
inferences
from
the
record,
the
case
should
go
to
the
jury.
i
submit
that
was
the
type
here
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
setting
up
the
standard
of
proof,
requiring
the
plaintiff
to
prove
the
case
by
probabilities
with
an
error
and
disregarded
all
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
thank
you.
