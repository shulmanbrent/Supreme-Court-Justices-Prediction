mr.
william
waller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
old
english
saying
about
not
being
able
to
see
the
wood
for
the
trees
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
applicable
here.
the
solicitor
general's
argument
here
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
on
yesterday
mr.
davis
had
bought
$25,000.00
of
preferred
stock
from
this
corporation
and
today
had
sold
it
back
and
got
his
money
back.
now,
true,
he
has
given
up
only
a
piece
of
paper
but
he's
got
back
exactly
the
amount
of
money
that
he
put
out.
he
put
out
$25,000.00
and
got
the
piece
of
paper,
now
he
gives
back
the
piece
of
paper
and
gets
the
$25,000.00.
and
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
congress
has
power
under
the
sixteenth
amendment
even
if
it
wanted
to,
to
say
that
that
is
taxable
income.
i
don't
think
congress
intended
any
such
result
but
if
congress
had
intended
such
a
result,
i
think
that
eisner
versus
macomber
teaches
that
that
would
not
be
treated
as
an
income
or
deem
no
more
than
if
a
race
horse
were
involved
if
you,
for
the
race
horse
–-
mr.
william
waller
treated
as
a
return
of
capital.
mr.
william
waller
a
sale,
that's
what
this
was,
a
sale
of
stock
to
the
corporation
but
the
minutes
provided,
the
director's
minutes
that
mr.
davis
offer
the
sale
of
stock
back
to
the
corporation,
$25,000.00,
the
offer
was
accepted,
the
stock
was
bought,
the
stock
was
redeemed,
so
everybody
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
after
the
transaction,
great
taking
the
transaction
as
a
whole,
the
two
poll
of
the
transaction.
mr.
davis
was
in
the
same
position.
the
corporation
who
had
this
temporary
capital
which
he
had
needed
in
order
to
get
the
rfc
loan,
when
the
rfc
loan
was
paid
off
as
had
been
intended
all
the
time,
the
stock
was
redeemed,
the
corporation
did
not
need
the
$25,000.00
as
the
solicitor
general
states,
it
was
surplus
money,
the
preferred
stock
was
6%
preferred
stock,
this
was
1963
when
preferred,
when
6%
was
a
good
even
money
in
any
normal
board
of
directors.
having
$25,000.00
that
was
not
needed
in
the
business,
having
6%
preferred
stock
outstanding
would
have
redeemed
the
preferred
stock.
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation.
it
may
have
been
that
mr.
davis,
he
probably
did
wanted
this
$25,000.00
back
since
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
returned
it
into
the
corporation
had
been
served
but
he
is
at
the
end
of
this
two
prong
transaction
exactly
where
he
started,
with
his
money
back,
that
is
a
classic
example
of
a
return
of
capital
and
not
of
a
dividend.
as
i
have
stated,
if
the
two
transactions
had
occurred
one
day
after
the
other
one.
according
to
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
this
would
be
a
dividend
merely
because
of
the
existence
of
earnings
and
profits.
mr.
william
waller
i
say
that's
a
return
of
capital
also,
that's
a
return
of
capital.
i
don't
think
it's
a
bit
difference
and
if
had
been
a
subordinated?
no.
mr.
william
waller
yes.
mr.
william
waller
well,
a
subordinated
note
would
also
have
been
at
the
risk
of
the
business
if
it
was
subordinated
as
the
usual
subordinated
note
is,
that
is
to
--
to
the
rfc
loan,
to
bank
--
mr.
william
waller
--
bank
debts
and
--
mr.
william
waller
oh
yes,
yes
it
would,
that's
true.
mr.
william
waller
he
preferred
not
to
do
it
because
that
made
the
balance
sheet
better
for
all
the
business
purposes
in
general.
in
other
words,
you
didn't
have
that
debt.
on
the
balance
sheet,
it
was
all,
appeared
to
be
equity
capital
for
it
was.
now,
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
where
this
very
same
thing
happened
in
the
lower
courts
and
uniformly
held
for
the
taxpayer
that
where
there
was
a
temporary
advance
of
equity
capital
to
a
corporation
for
a
limited
purpose
and
for
a
limited
time
with
the
understanding
that
it
would
be
--
that
the
stock
would
be
redeemed,
when
that
purpose
had
been
served,
that
that
is
a
return
of
capital
they
have
used
therefore
is
business
purpose.
now,
i
think
one
court
did
say
and
the
solicitor
general
has
used
the
argument
that
while
there's
a
business
purpose
in
issuing
the
stock
in
the
first
place
that
the
redemption
of
the
stock
is
not
a
business
purpose
but
i
don't
think
you
can
view
the
entire
transaction
of
this
kind
as
in
isolation,
view
the
redemption
in
isolation
probably
original
issuance
of
the
stock.
the
transaction
should
be
viewed
as
one
transaction
or
two
prongs,
as
i
have
stated
of
a
transaction.
now,
i
will
have
to
agree
that
this
net
effect
test
is
irrelevant.
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
advanced
that
thought.
the
reason,
the
net
effect
test
or
the
strict
net
effect
test
i
think
has
come
into
play
was
largely
because
of
the
case
that
mr.
griswold
tried
when
he
was
in
private
practice,
they
bet
for
the
state
case
in
which
this
court
reversed
the
second
circuit.
whereupon,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
bet
for
the
state
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
stock
redemption,
it
involved
booth
in
a
reorganization
case
and
the
second
circuit
had
held
that
this
booth
was
a
return
of
capital
and
not
a
dividend.
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
dividend
under
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
used
the
words
effect.
whereupon,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
--
the
supreme
court
has
now
reversed
all
of
our
earlier
decisions
in
redemption
cases.
so
from
now
on,
the
second
circuit
has
followed
what
they
call
as
strict
net
effect
test
saying
that
the
bedford
decision
had
overruled
our
prior
decision
when
it
didn't
do
any
such
thing.
and
even
as
late
as
the
levin
case
last
year,
year
before
last,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
repeated
this
statement,
that
the
bedford
case
had
overruled
their
prior
decisions
where
they
had
followed
the
same
or
a
different
rule
regarding
redemptions.
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
pointed
out
very
clearly
that
the
two
situations
are
entirely
different.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
302
(b)
(1)
states
specifically
as
it
could
be
stated
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
in
302
(b)
(1)
was
to
revert
in
part
to
existing
law
under
the
section
115
(g)
of
the
old
1939
government.
so,
congress
said,
the
senate
committee
said
that
they
were
restoring
that
to
the
house
bill
which
it
left
out
the
essentially
equivalent
test
and
they
were
restoring
this
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend
test
for
the
purpose
of
going
back
to
existing
law
so
that
a
taxpayer
who
could
not
come
within
one
of
these
so
called
safe
harbor
provisions
of
the
new
code,
the
ones
that
we
agree
are
not
applicable
here.
they
could
not
come
within
one
of
them.
he
could
still
rely
on
the
fact
that
his
redemption
was
not
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
nothing
can
be
planned
out
it
seems
to
me
than
the
statement
in
the
statement
several
times
in
the
senate
committee
report
that
that
was
what
was
being
done.
the
original
house
bill
had
left
out
this
essentially
equivalent
test
and
it
only
provided
these
mechanical
tests
based
on
ownership
of
stock.
the
questions
--
the
provisions
being
that
if
the
shareholder's
interest
was
terminated
or
if
there
were
disproportionate
redemptions,
he
could
by
following
these
technical
rules
escape
dividend
treatment.
now,
those
safe
harbor
provisions
all
referred
to
ownership
of
stock
and
the
house
bill
had
in
it.
these
attribution
rules
which
that
said
should
be
followed
in
the
determining
the
ownership
of
stock.
well,
the
senate
committee
kept
that
provision
about
determining
the
ownership
of
stock,
the
attribution
rules
for
determining
the
ownership
of
stock
but
then
puts
back
into
the
new
1954
code,
the
old
1939
provision
about
essentially
equivalent
to
the
dividend.
we
say
that
these
attribution
rules
were
not
intended
by
congress
to
apply
to
the
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend
test.
they
were
intended
to
apply
for
the
purposes
of
determining
ownership
in
those
provisions
where
ownership
of
stock
was
mentioned
and
there
was
no
mention
of
ownership
of
stock
in
section
302
(b)
(1).
so,
while
the
lower
courts
said
no
this
section
is
pretty
wrong,
they
said
for
the
purposes
of
this
section,
we'll
say
that
the
attribution
rules
apply
but
even
though
they
do
apply,
this
particular
redemption
is
okay
because
of
the
business
purpose
rule
and
in
one
place,
in
one
respect,
i
think
i
must
agree
whole
heartedly
with
the
solicitor
general
and
that
is
that
these
attribution
rules
either
apply
or
they
don't
apply.
you
can't
say
that
they
apply
where
a
father
and
son
love
each
other
but
they
don't
apply
where
they
are
estranged
or
where
a
man
and
his
wife
are
estranged
or
where
a
partner
and
his
partners,
a
partnership
and
partners
are
estranged,
that
would
create
interminable
difficulty
in
finding
out
when
the
attribution
rules
do
apply
and
when
they
don't
apply.
but
i
say
they
don't
apply
at
all
with
respect
to
section
302
(b)
(1)
because
that
was
the
old
test
from
the
1939
code
where
there
were
no
attribution
rules.
and
in
every
statement
in
the
senate
committee
report
saying
what
they
were
trying
to
do,
it
was
specifically
stated
that
they
were
reverting
to
existing
law
with
no
qualification
based
on
these
attribution
rules.
so,
--
mr.
william
waller
do
not
apply.
mr.
william
waller
alright,
i'll
say
it
for
this
reason
your
honor.
the
section
318
i
think
is
ambiguous
in
this
respect
because
it
says
that
section
318
(a)
shall
apply
in
determining
the
ownership
of
stock
for
purposes
of
this
section.
now,
i
would
have
to
agree
that
if
we
didn't
have
any
legislative
history
and
we
didn't
have
any
question
of
constitutional
doubts
raised
that
probably
one
would
say
it
applied
for
the
purposes
of
the
old
section
including
302
(b)
(1).
but
if
you
look
at
the
sequence
of
events
by
which
this
particular
section
got
in
to
the
1954
code,
i
think
it's
perfectly
plain
that
what
congress
was
saying
was
that
these
attribution
rules
should
apply
in
determining
the
ownership
of
stock
for
the
purposes
of
these
provisions
of
the
section
where
ownership
of
stock
is
mentioned,
namely,
section
2
and
section
3
but
not
section
1,
i
mean
subsection
1
of
section
302.
mr.
william
waller
yes
sir.
mr.
william
waller
look
at
page
41
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
constructive
only
surplus
stock,
except
as
provided
in
paragraph
two
of
this
subsection,
section
318
(a)
shall
apply
in
determining
the
ownership
of
stock
for
purposes
of
this
section.
now,
i
say
that
you
should
emphasize
the
words
the
ownership
of
stock
because
in
the
other
provisions
of
section
302,
the
ownership
of
stock
is
mentioned,
whereas
in
the
essentially
equivalent
provision,
there
is
no
mention
of
ownership
of
stock
and
ownership
of
stock
is
considered
only
by
virtue
of
judge
made
rules
and
not
because
of
any
statutory
provision.
mr.
william
waller
well
yeah,
and
that's
why
i,
that's
why
i
have
just
raised.
mr.
william
waller
that's
what
i've
been
reading,
yes.
mr.
william
waller
yes,
that's
my
point.
and
i
say
the
sufficient
ambiguity
in
the
language
that
we
can
go
to
the
senate
committee
reports
to
find
out
what
they
meant
and
when
we
do
go
to
the
senate
committee
report,
i
think
it's
best
to
explain
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
attribution
rules
to
apply
when
determining
whether
a
redemption
is
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
mr.
william
waller
well,
no
court
has
accepted
it
whole
heartedly,
they
have
only
said
we
think
there
ought
to
be
exceptions
where
this
family
and
strange
one
and
other
things
like
–-
mr.
william
waller
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
veto
applies,
it
didn't
apply
but
i
say
it
doesn't
apply
and
he
says
it
does
apply.
mr.
william
waller
yes
–-
mr.
william
waller
my
brief
–-
mr.
william
waller
starting
on
page
10,
well,
there's
a
part
of
it,
the
main
part
of
it
is
yes,
pages
10
and
11.
then
if
there,
it's
referred
to
all
through
the
brief,
it's
a
very
short
brief
if
your
honor
please,
and
it's
referred
to
again
on
page
14.
mr.
william
waller
i'm
not
arguing
that
he
just
loaned
it,
no
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
it
was
a
purchase
of
preferred
stock
by
davis.
mr.
william
waller
purchased
or
preferred
stock
from
the
corporation
--
mr.
william
waller
agreement
they
would
buy
it
back
when
the
rfc
loan
was
paid
off.
it
would
redeem
it,
when
the
rfc
loan
is
paid
off.
that
was
the
general
understanding,
it
wasn't
in
the
form
of
a
written
agreement
but
it
was
understood
between
all
parties
involved
that
this
was
a
--
this
was
done
solely
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
rfc
loan.
mr.
william
waller
yes.
the
court
found
that.
mr.
william
waller
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
waller
both
lower
courts.
alright
sir,
in
the
appendix,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
would
be
i
think
he
quotes
from
the
district
court,
pages
40
--
mr.
william
waller
well,
yes,
but
i'm
thinking
about
the
place,
well,
he
quotes
the,
the
court
of
appeals
court's
on
pages
45
and
46
of
the
appendix.
the
subsequent
acquisition
of
bradley
stockholdings
by
taxpayer
making
the
redemption
distribution
essentially
pro
rata
because
of
the
section
318
(a)
attribution
rules,
neither
in
pairs
the
legitimacy
of
the
purpose
underlying
the
issuance
of
the
preferred
stock
(to
provide
additional
security
required
by
rfc)
now
alters
the
fact
that
the
redemption
was
simply
the
final
(contemplated
step
taken
in
completion
of
this
purpose).
mr.
william
waller
they
held
with
us
that
this
was
return
of
capital
and
not
a
dividend.
the
district
court
held
it
was
a
return
of
capital
and
not
a
dividend.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
a
return
of
capital
and
not
a
dividend
and
we
are
here
seeking
to
sustain
the
decisions
below.
mr.
william
waller
well,
i
wouldn't
say
there
was
no
difference
because
of
course
the
note
is
different
from
preferred
stock,
there's
a
lot
of
consequences
that
attached
to
a
note
that
do
not
attached.
mr.
william
waller
but
so
far
as
this
particular
situation
is
concerned
as
to
whether
it's
a
return
of
capital
or
not,
i
say
that's
a
return
of
capital
mr.
william
waller
yes.
mr.
william
waller
if
it
had
been
a
subordinated
note,
it
would
not
have
been
that
the
return
would
not
have
been
a
dividend
and
the
solicitor
general
would
not
even
have
made
such
a
contention
as
he
stated
a
while
ago.
he
didn't
quite
go
that
far
but
he
said
--
mr.
william
waller
he
didn't
go
quite
that
far
but
write
almost
that
far,
he
--
mr.
william
waller
he
said
i
don't
think
the
government
would
have
much
case,
that's
what
he
said
i
think
in
the
vernacular.
mr.
william
waller
i
don't
think
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
there's
any
significant
difference
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
waller
that's
correct
your
honor.
in
other
words,
as
to
return
of
capital
in
either
event,
what
the
man
has
done,
he
hasn't
made
any
money.
income
is
making
some
money.
income
under
the
--
mr.
william
waller
he
just
got
his
own
$25,000.00
back,
he
got
back
what
he
put
in,
in
other
words,
he's
just
exactly
where
he
was
to
start
with.
mr.
william
waller
if
he'd
put
that,
if
he
put
that
in
common
stock
and
if
you
leave
this
attribution
rules
out
of
it
by,
it
would've
been
the
same
thing.
mr.
william
waller
i
say
and
finally
when
even
with
the
attribution
rules.
mr.
william
waller
and
i
would
say
i
would
have
a
more
difficult
case
if
it
were
for
a
common
stock
than
with
--
mr.
william
waller
well,
i
think
--
i
think
if
there
had
been
a
clear
cut
agreement
that
it
would
be
redeemed
as
soon
as
the
rfc
loan
was
paid
off
that
i
could
substantiate
the
common
the
same
way.
mr.
william
waller
but
i'd
rather
do
it
with
the
preferred.
mr.
william
waller
well,
i'll
have
to
go
back
--
i'll
have
to
go
back
to
the
1920
--
legislative
history
of
the
1926
act
to
explain
that,
because
the
--
in
1926,
when
the
statute
was
amended,
the
--
it
was
apparent
from
the
reports
of
the
legislative
committee's
lab
that
what
they
had
in
mind
was
taxing
a
pro
rata
redemption
of
common
stock,
in
other
words,
his,
two
people
have
got
equal
amount
of
common
stock
and
he
redeemed
10%
of
each
one,
well,
that's
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
but
now
of
course
that
could
apply
here
only
by
virtue
of
the
attribution
rules
because
without
the
attribution
rules,
mr.
davis
owned
only
25%
of
the
common
stock.
his
wife
owned
25%
and
his
two
children
who
were
ertainly
not
his
dummy
as
in
any
way
even
though
they
may
have
been
family
solidarity
as
distinguished
from
estrangement.
they
were
the
stock
holders
and
they
could
have
redeemed
through
the
board
of
directors
get
to
redeem
this
stock
if
mr.
davis
hadn't
wanted
it
redeemed.
as
far
as
that's
concern,
they
could
have
outvoted
him
and
redeemed
the
stock
if
he
had
not
wanted
it
redeemed.
so,
the
--
it's
not
correct
say
that
this
redemption
was
strictly
for
the
benefit
of
mr.
davis,
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation
to
get
rid
of
a
60%
preferred
stock
in
1963,
it
wouldn't
be
the
day
if
anybody
had
some
6%
stock
outstanding
to
david
want
to
keep
it
of
course,
but
in
1963,
the
situation
was
entirely
different,
6%
--
mr.
william
waller
the
money
was
put
in
back
in
1946
i
believe
it
was,
45.
mr.
william
waller
63.
mr.
william
waller
yes,
that's
when
the
rfc
loan
wouldn't
pay
it
off,
it
took
a
long
time
to
pay
it
off.
mr.
william
waller
the
whole
corporation
was
help
back
because
--
mr.
william
waller
it
was,
yes,
that's
correct.
the
corporation
used
this
money
all
that
time.
it
had
that
for
working
capital
all
that
time.
mr.
william
waller
he
got
it
back
for
his
preferred
stock,
he
got
it
back
for
his
stock.
mr.
william
waller
he
--
mr.
william
waller
yes,
they
had
it
all
that
time.
mr.
william
waller
not
until
--
mr.
william
waller
well,
because
they
had
it
all
that
time
as
working
capital.
all
the
time
that
the
rfc
loan
was
outstanding,
the
corporation
had
it
as
working
capital
and
it
was
redeemed
only
when
the
purpose
had
been
served,
when
the
rfc
loan
was
paid
off.
mr.
william
waller
1963.
the
loan
was
paid
off
in
63
and
at
that
time
shortly
thereafter,
the
preferred
stock
was
redeemed.
mr.
william
waller
the
company
did
not
owe
any
body
else
anything
and
the
testimony
was
that
the
corporation
had
never
borrowed
any
money
since
then
from
any
body.
in
other
words,
it
was
surplus
money
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said.
they
didn't
need
the
money.
there
it
was,
they
didn't
need
it
so
they
redeemed
the
60
--
mr.
william
waller
no,
money,
money
your
honor
not
stock,
money.
mr.
william
waller
yes.
mr.
william
waller
that's
right,
so
i
say
he
didn't
have
any
income,
because
that's
not
income,
he
didn't
make
anything.
mr.
william
waller
oh
yes,
oh
yes,
and
his
common
stock
became
more
valuable
as
a
result
of
it
and
his
wife's
common
stock
and
his
children's
common
stock.
mr.
william
waller
he
didn't
loose
anything
else.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
william
waller
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
old
english
saying
about
not
being
able
to
see
the
wood
for
the
trees
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
applicable
here.
the
solicitor
general's
argument
here
would
be
exactly
the
same
if
on
yesterday
mr.
davis
had
bought
$25,000.00
of
preferred
stock
from
this
corporation
and
today
had
sold
it
back
and
got
his
money
back.
now,
true,
he
has
given
up
only
a
piece
of
paper
but
he's
got
back
exactly
the
amount
of
money
that
he
put
out.
he
put
out
$25,000.00
and
got
the
piece
of
paper,
now
he
gives
back
the
piece
of
paper
and
gets
the
$25,000.00.
and
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
congress
has
power
under
the
sixteenth
amendment
even
if
it
wanted
to,
to
say
that
that
is
taxable
income.
i
don't
think
congress
intended
any
such
result
but
if
congress
had
intended
such
a
result,
i
think
that
eisner
versus
macomber
teaches
that
that
would
not
be
treated
as
an
income
or
deem
no
more
than
if
a
race
horse
were
involved
if
you,
for
the
race
horse
–-
mr.
william
waller
treated
as
a
return
of
capital.
mr.
william
waller
a
sale,
that's
what
this
was,
a
sale
of
stock
to
the
corporation
but
the
minutes
provided,
the
director's
minutes
that
mr.
davis
offer
the
sale
of
stock
back
to
the
corporation,
$25,000.00,
the
offer
was
accepted,
the
stock
was
bought,
the
stock
was
redeemed,
so
everybody
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
after
the
transaction,
great
taking
the
transaction
as
a
whole,
the
two
poll
of
the
transaction.
mr.
davis
was
in
the
same
position.
the
corporation
who
had
this
temporary
capital
which
he
had
needed
in
order
to
get
the
rfc
loan,
when
the
rfc
loan
was
paid
off
as
had
been
intended
all
the
time,
the
stock
was
redeemed,
the
corporation
did
not
need
the
$25,000.00
as
the
solicitor
general
states,
it
was
surplus
money,
the
preferred
stock
was
6%
preferred
stock,
this
was
1963
when
preferred,
when
6%
was
a
good
even
money
in
any
normal
board
of
directors.
having
$25,000.00
that
was
not
needed
in
the
business,
having
6%
preferred
stock
outstanding
would
have
redeemed
the
preferred
stock.
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation.
it
may
have
been
that
mr.
davis,
he
probably
did
wanted
this
$25,000.00
back
since
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
returned
it
into
the
corporation
had
been
served
but
he
is
at
the
end
of
this
two
prong
transaction
exactly
where
he
started,
with
his
money
back,
that
is
a
classic
example
of
a
return
of
capital
and
not
of
a
dividend.
as
i
have
stated,
if
the
two
transactions
had
occurred
one
day
after
the
other
one.
according
to
the
solicitor
general's
argument,
this
would
be
a
dividend
merely
because
of
the
existence
of
earnings
and
profits.
mr.
william
waller
i
say
that's
a
return
of
capital
also,
that's
a
return
of
capital.
i
don't
think
it's
a
bit
difference
and
if
had
been
a
subordinated?
no.
mr.
william
waller
yes.
mr.
william
waller
well,
a
subordinated
note
would
also
have
been
at
the
risk
of
the
business
if
it
was
subordinated
as
the
usual
subordinated
note
is,
that
is
to
--
to
the
rfc
loan,
to
bank
--
mr.
william
waller
--
bank
debts
and
--
mr.
william
waller
oh
yes,
yes
it
would,
that's
true.
mr.
william
waller
he
preferred
not
to
do
it
because
that
made
the
balance
sheet
better
for
all
the
business
purposes
in
general.
in
other
words,
you
didn't
have
that
debt.
on
the
balance
sheet,
it
was
all,
appeared
to
be
equity
capital
for
it
was.
now,
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
where
this
very
same
thing
happened
in
the
lower
courts
and
uniformly
held
for
the
taxpayer
that
where
there
was
a
temporary
advance
of
equity
capital
to
a
corporation
for
a
limited
purpose
and
for
a
limited
time
with
the
understanding
that
it
would
be
--
that
the
stock
would
be
redeemed,
when
that
purpose
had
been
served,
that
that
is
a
return
of
capital
they
have
used
therefore
is
business
purpose.
now,
i
think
one
court
did
say
and
the
solicitor
general
has
used
the
argument
that
while
there's
a
business
purpose
in
issuing
the
stock
in
the
first
place
that
the
redemption
of
the
stock
is
not
a
business
purpose
but
i
don't
think
you
can
view
the
entire
transaction
of
this
kind
as
in
isolation,
view
the
redemption
in
isolation
probably
original
issuance
of
the
stock.
the
transaction
should
be
viewed
as
one
transaction
or
two
prongs,
as
i
have
stated
of
a
transaction.
now,
i
will
have
to
agree
that
this
net
effect
test
is
irrelevant.
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
advanced
that
thought.
the
reason,
the
net
effect
test
or
the
strict
net
effect
test
i
think
has
come
into
play
was
largely
because
of
the
case
that
mr.
griswold
tried
when
he
was
in
private
practice,
they
bet
for
the
state
case
in
which
this
court
reversed
the
second
circuit.
whereupon,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
bet
for
the
state
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
stock
redemption,
it
involved
booth
in
a
reorganization
case
and
the
second
circuit
had
held
that
this
booth
was
a
return
of
capital
and
not
a
dividend.
this
court
held
that
it
was
a
dividend
under
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
used
the
words
effect.
whereupon,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
--
the
supreme
court
has
now
reversed
all
of
our
earlier
decisions
in
redemption
cases.
so
from
now
on,
the
second
circuit
has
followed
what
they
call
as
strict
net
effect
test
saying
that
the
bedford
decision
had
overruled
our
prior
decision
when
it
didn't
do
any
such
thing.
and
even
as
late
as
the
levin
case
last
year,
year
before
last,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
repeated
this
statement,
that
the
bedford
case
had
overruled
their
prior
decisions
where
they
had
followed
the
same
or
a
different
rule
regarding
redemptions.
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
pointed
out
very
clearly
that
the
two
situations
are
entirely
different.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
302
(b)
(1)
states
specifically
as
it
could
be
stated
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
in
302
(b)
(1)
was
to
revert
in
part
to
existing
law
under
the
section
115
(g)
of
the
old
1939
government.
so,
congress
said,
the
senate
committee
said
that
they
were
restoring
that
to
the
house
bill
which
it
left
out
the
essentially
equivalent
test
and
they
were
restoring
this
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend
test
for
the
purpose
of
going
back
to
existing
law
so
that
a
taxpayer
who
could
not
come
within
one
of
these
so
called
safe
harbor
provisions
of
the
new
code,
the
ones
that
we
agree
are
not
applicable
here.
they
could
not
come
within
one
of
them.
he
could
still
rely
on
the
fact
that
his
redemption
was
not
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
nothing
can
be
planned
out
it
seems
to
me
than
the
statement
in
the
statement
several
times
in
the
senate
committee
report
that
that
was
what
was
being
done.
the
original
house
bill
had
left
out
this
essentially
equivalent
test
and
it
only
provided
these
mechanical
tests
based
on
ownership
of
stock.
the
questions
--
the
provisions
being
that
if
the
shareholder's
interest
was
terminated
or
if
there
were
disproportionate
redemptions,
he
could
by
following
these
technical
rules
escape
dividend
treatment.
now,
those
safe
harbor
provisions
all
referred
to
ownership
of
stock
and
the
house
bill
had
in
it.
these
attribution
rules
which
that
said
should
be
followed
in
the
determining
the
ownership
of
stock.
well,
the
senate
committee
kept
that
provision
about
determining
the
ownership
of
stock,
the
attribution
rules
for
determining
the
ownership
of
stock
but
then
puts
back
into
the
new
1954
code,
the
old
1939
provision
about
essentially
equivalent
to
the
dividend.
we
say
that
these
attribution
rules
were
not
intended
by
congress
to
apply
to
the
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend
test.
they
were
intended
to
apply
for
the
purposes
of
determining
ownership
in
those
provisions
where
ownership
of
stock
was
mentioned
and
there
was
no
mention
of
ownership
of
stock
in
section
302
(b)
(1).
so,
while
the
lower
courts
said
no
this
section
is
pretty
wrong,
they
said
for
the
purposes
of
this
section,
we'll
say
that
the
attribution
rules
apply
but
even
though
they
do
apply,
this
particular
redemption
is
okay
because
of
the
business
purpose
rule
and
in
one
place,
in
one
respect,
i
think
i
must
agree
whole
heartedly
with
the
solicitor
general
and
that
is
that
these
attribution
rules
either
apply
or
they
don't
apply.
you
can't
say
that
they
apply
where
a
father
and
son
love
each
other
but
they
don't
apply
where
they
are
estranged
or
where
a
man
and
his
wife
are
estranged
or
where
a
partner
and
his
partners,
a
partnership
and
partners
are
estranged,
that
would
create
interminable
difficulty
in
finding
out
when
the
attribution
rules
do
apply
and
when
they
don't
apply.
but
i
say
they
don't
apply
at
all
with
respect
to
section
302
(b)
(1)
because
that
was
the
old
test
from
the
1939
code
where
there
were
no
attribution
rules.
and
in
every
statement
in
the
senate
committee
report
saying
what
they
were
trying
to
do,
it
was
specifically
stated
that
they
were
reverting
to
existing
law
with
no
qualification
based
on
these
attribution
rules.
so,
--
mr.
william
waller
do
not
apply.
mr.
william
waller
alright,
i'll
say
it
for
this
reason
your
honor.
the
section
318
i
think
is
ambiguous
in
this
respect
because
it
says
that
section
318
(a)
shall
apply
in
determining
the
ownership
of
stock
for
purposes
of
this
section.
now,
i
would
have
to
agree
that
if
we
didn't
have
any
legislative
history
and
we
didn't
have
any
question
of
constitutional
doubts
raised
that
probably
one
would
say
it
applied
for
the
purposes
of
the
old
section
including
302
(b)
(1).
but
if
you
look
at
the
sequence
of
events
by
which
this
particular
section
got
in
to
the
1954
code,
i
think
it's
perfectly
plain
that
what
congress
was
saying
was
that
these
attribution
rules
should
apply
in
determining
the
ownership
of
stock
for
the
purposes
of
these
provisions
of
the
section
where
ownership
of
stock
is
mentioned,
namely,
section
2
and
section
3
but
not
section
1,
i
mean
subsection
1
of
section
302.
mr.
william
waller
yes
sir.
mr.
william
waller
look
at
page
41
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
constructive
only
surplus
stock,
except
as
provided
in
paragraph
two
of
this
subsection,
section
318
(a)
shall
apply
in
determining
the
ownership
of
stock
for
purposes
of
this
section.
now,
i
say
that
you
should
emphasize
the
words
the
ownership
of
stock
because
in
the
other
provisions
of
section
302,
the
ownership
of
stock
is
mentioned,
whereas
in
the
essentially
equivalent
provision,
there
is
no
mention
of
ownership
of
stock
and
ownership
of
stock
is
considered
only
by
virtue
of
judge
made
rules
and
not
because
of
any
statutory
provision.
mr.
william
waller
well
yeah,
and
that's
why
i,
that's
why
i
have
just
raised.
mr.
william
waller
that's
what
i've
been
reading,
yes.
mr.
william
waller
yes,
that's
my
point.
and
i
say
the
sufficient
ambiguity
in
the
language
that
we
can
go
to
the
senate
committee
reports
to
find
out
what
they
meant
and
when
we
do
go
to
the
senate
committee
report,
i
think
it's
best
to
explain
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
attribution
rules
to
apply
when
determining
whether
a
redemption
is
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
mr.
william
waller
well,
no
court
has
accepted
it
whole
heartedly,
they
have
only
said
we
think
there
ought
to
be
exceptions
where
this
family
and
strange
one
and
other
things
like
–-
mr.
william
waller
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
the
veto
applies,
it
didn't
apply
but
i
say
it
doesn't
apply
and
he
says
it
does
apply.
mr.
william
waller
yes
–-
mr.
william
waller
my
brief
–-
mr.
william
waller
starting
on
page
10,
well,
there's
a
part
of
it,
the
main
part
of
it
is
yes,
pages
10
and
11.
then
if
there,
it's
referred
to
all
through
the
brief,
it's
a
very
short
brief
if
your
honor
please,
and
it's
referred
to
again
on
page
14.
mr.
william
waller
i'm
not
arguing
that
he
just
loaned
it,
no
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
it
was
a
purchase
of
preferred
stock
by
davis.
mr.
william
waller
purchased
or
preferred
stock
from
the
corporation
--
mr.
william
waller
agreement
they
would
buy
it
back
when
the
rfc
loan
was
paid
off.
it
would
redeem
it,
when
the
rfc
loan
is
paid
off.
that
was
the
general
understanding,
it
wasn't
in
the
form
of
a
written
agreement
but
it
was
understood
between
all
parties
involved
that
this
was
a
--
this
was
done
solely
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
rfc
loan.
mr.
william
waller
yes.
the
court
found
that.
mr.
william
waller
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
waller
both
lower
courts.
alright
sir,
in
the
appendix,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
would
be
i
think
he
quotes
from
the
district
court,
pages
40
--
mr.
william
waller
well,
yes,
but
i'm
thinking
about
the
place,
well,
he
quotes
the,
the
court
of
appeals
court's
on
pages
45
and
46
of
the
appendix.
the
subsequent
acquisition
of
bradley
stockholdings
by
taxpayer
making
the
redemption
distribution
essentially
pro
rata
because
of
the
section
318
(a)
attribution
rules,
neither
in
pairs
the
legitimacy
of
the
purpose
underlying
the
issuance
of
the
preferred
stock
(to
provide
additional
security
required
by
rfc)
now
alters
the
fact
that
the
redemption
was
simply
the
final
(contemplated
step
taken
in
completion
of
this
purpose).
mr.
william
waller
they
held
with
us
that
this
was
return
of
capital
and
not
a
dividend.
the
district
court
held
it
was
a
return
of
capital
and
not
a
dividend.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
a
return
of
capital
and
not
a
dividend
and
we
are
here
seeking
to
sustain
the
decisions
below.
mr.
william
waller
well,
i
wouldn't
say
there
was
no
difference
because
of
course
the
note
is
different
from
preferred
stock,
there's
a
lot
of
consequences
that
attached
to
a
note
that
do
not
attached.
mr.
william
waller
but
so
far
as
this
particular
situation
is
concerned
as
to
whether
it's
a
return
of
capital
or
not,
i
say
that's
a
return
of
capital
mr.
william
waller
yes.
mr.
william
waller
if
it
had
been
a
subordinated
note,
it
would
not
have
been
that
the
return
would
not
have
been
a
dividend
and
the
solicitor
general
would
not
even
have
made
such
a
contention
as
he
stated
a
while
ago.
he
didn't
quite
go
that
far
but
he
said
--
mr.
william
waller
he
didn't
go
quite
that
far
but
write
almost
that
far,
he
--
mr.
william
waller
he
said
i
don't
think
the
government
would
have
much
case,
that's
what
he
said
i
think
in
the
vernacular.
mr.
william
waller
i
don't
think
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
that
there's
any
significant
difference
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
waller
that's
correct
your
honor.
in
other
words,
as
to
return
of
capital
in
either
event,
what
the
man
has
done,
he
hasn't
made
any
money.
income
is
making
some
money.
income
under
the
--
mr.
william
waller
he
just
got
his
own
$25,000.00
back,
he
got
back
what
he
put
in,
in
other
words,
he's
just
exactly
where
he
was
to
start
with.
mr.
william
waller
if
he'd
put
that,
if
he
put
that
in
common
stock
and
if
you
leave
this
attribution
rules
out
of
it
by,
it
would've
been
the
same
thing.
mr.
william
waller
i
say
and
finally
when
even
with
the
attribution
rules.
mr.
william
waller
and
i
would
say
i
would
have
a
more
difficult
case
if
it
were
for
a
common
stock
than
with
--
mr.
william
waller
well,
i
think
--
i
think
if
there
had
been
a
clear
cut
agreement
that
it
would
be
redeemed
as
soon
as
the
rfc
loan
was
paid
off
that
i
could
substantiate
the
common
the
same
way.
mr.
william
waller
but
i'd
rather
do
it
with
the
preferred.
mr.
william
waller
well,
i'll
have
to
go
back
--
i'll
have
to
go
back
to
the
1920
--
legislative
history
of
the
1926
act
to
explain
that,
because
the
--
in
1926,
when
the
statute
was
amended,
the
--
it
was
apparent
from
the
reports
of
the
legislative
committee's
lab
that
what
they
had
in
mind
was
taxing
a
pro
rata
redemption
of
common
stock,
in
other
words,
his,
two
people
have
got
equal
amount
of
common
stock
and
he
redeemed
10%
of
each
one,
well,
that's
essentially
equivalent
to
a
dividend.
but
now
of
course
that
could
apply
here
only
by
virtue
of
the
attribution
rules
because
without
the
attribution
rules,
mr.
davis
owned
only
25%
of
the
common
stock.
his
wife
owned
25%
and
his
two
children
who
were
ertainly
not
his
dummy
as
in
any
way
even
though
they
may
have
been
family
solidarity
as
distinguished
from
estrangement.
they
were
the
stock
holders
and
they
could
have
redeemed
through
the
board
of
directors
get
to
redeem
this
stock
if
mr.
davis
hadn't
wanted
it
redeemed.
as
far
as
that's
concern,
they
could
have
outvoted
him
and
redeemed
the
stock
if
he
had
not
wanted
it
redeemed.
so,
the
--
it's
not
correct
say
that
this
redemption
was
strictly
for
the
benefit
of
mr.
davis,
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
corporation
to
get
rid
of
a
60%
preferred
stock
in
1963,
it
wouldn't
be
the
day
if
anybody
had
some
6%
stock
outstanding
to
david
want
to
keep
it
of
course,
but
in
1963,
the
situation
was
entirely
different,
6%
--
mr.
william
waller
the
money
was
put
in
back
in
1946
i
believe
it
was,
45.
mr.
william
waller
63.
mr.
william
waller
yes,
that's
when
the
rfc
loan
wouldn't
pay
it
off,
it
took
a
long
time
to
pay
it
off.
mr.
william
waller
the
whole
corporation
was
help
back
because
--
mr.
william
waller
it
was,
yes,
that's
correct.
the
corporation
used
this
money
all
that
time.
it
had
that
for
working
capital
all
that
time.
mr.
william
waller
he
got
it
back
for
his
preferred
stock,
he
got
it
back
for
his
stock.
mr.
william
waller
he
--
mr.
william
waller
yes,
they
had
it
all
that
time.
mr.
william
waller
not
until
--
mr.
william
waller
well,
because
they
had
it
all
that
time
as
working
capital.
all
the
time
that
the
rfc
loan
was
outstanding,
the
corporation
had
it
as
working
capital
and
it
was
redeemed
only
when
the
purpose
had
been
served,
when
the
rfc
loan
was
paid
off.
mr.
william
waller
1963.
the
loan
was
paid
off
in
63
and
at
that
time
shortly
thereafter,
the
preferred
stock
was
redeemed.
mr.
william
waller
the
company
did
not
owe
any
body
else
anything
and
the
testimony
was
that
the
corporation
had
never
borrowed
any
money
since
then
from
any
body.
in
other
words,
it
was
surplus
money
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said.
they
didn't
need
the
money.
there
it
was,
they
didn't
need
it
so
they
redeemed
the
60
--
mr.
william
waller
no,
money,
money
your
honor
not
stock,
money.
mr.
william
waller
yes.
mr.
william
waller
that's
right,
so
i
say
he
didn't
have
any
income,
because
that's
not
income,
he
didn't
make
anything.
mr.
william
waller
oh
yes,
oh
yes,
and
his
common
stock
became
more
valuable
as
a
result
of
it
and
his
wife's
common
stock
and
his
children's
common
stock.
mr.
william
waller
he
didn't
loose
anything
else.
thank
you
your
honor.
