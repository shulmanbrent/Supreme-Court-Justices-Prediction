mr.
philip
weinberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
raises
the
question
whether
when
a
time
when
urban
problems
are
recognized
by
virtually
every
thoughtful
person
in
every
social
commentator
examining
american
life
to
be
of
the
most
serious
proportions.
the
state
of
new
york
made
out
employee;
it's
concededly
limited
resources
in
the
field
of
social
welfare
in
such
a
way
as
to
address
itself
to
these
problems
with
slightly
greater
emphasis.
now,
131-a
of
the
social
services
law
of
new
york
which
is
the
statute
of
this
case
is
all
about
provides
levels
of
welfare
allowances
for
welfare
recipients
in
the
state
of
new
york.
it
was
enacted
by
the
1969
legislature
and
as
i'm
sure
the
court
knows
it
was
the
same
statute
that
was
involved
in
rosado
against
wyman
which
this
court
decided
in
april
6.
section
131-a
establishes
levels
at
one
rate
for
welfare
recipients
within
new
york
city
and
it
is
slightly
lower
rate
approximately
$5.00
a
person
for
welfare
recipients
living
outside
new
york
city.
it
then
goes
on
to
give
the
appellant,
commissioner
wyman,
the
state
commissioner
of
social
services,
discretion
under
an
amendment
which
was
passed
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
131-a,
which
was
july
1,
1969,
discretion
to
increase
the
payments
in
any
county
upon
the
request
of
that
county
or
indeed
without
the
request
of
that
county
if
the
facts
warrant
and
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
statute.
commissioner
wyman
did
indeed
exercise
that
discretion
and
he
have
the
differential
between
the
new
york
city
welfare
payments
and
the
welfare
payments
in
the
suburban
counties
including
nassau
and
westchester
counties
which
are
adjacent
to
new
york,
essentially
suburban
counties
and
which
the
two
counties
in
which
the
plaintiff
here
reside.
it
has
to
be
presumed
as
this
court
has
stated
on
many
occasions
that
the
state
legislature
acted
with
that
knowledge
of
local
conditions
and
indeed
the
assemblymen
and
state
senators
who
passed
this
section
of
the
social
services
law
are
elected
from
very
small
districts.
they're
about
as
close
to
their
local
constituencies
as
any
elected
representative
can
be.
their
district
is
so
much
smaller
and
they
represent
less
people
than
a
congressman,
and
they
have
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of
local
conditions.
indeed,
it's
noteworthy
that
the
assemblyman
from
nassau
and
westchester
counties
predominantly
voted
for
this
bill.
now,
where
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
which
differential
was
i
have
indicated
halved
by
the
administrative
action
of
the
appellant
commissioner
wyman
before
the
bill
took
effect.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
1970
legislature
reenacted
section
131-a
with
increase
levels
but
they
maintained
the
differential
so
that
the
case
isn't
moot.
the
differential
still
exists
except
that
as
a
result
of
the
very
sweeping
preliminary
injunctions
issued
by
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
case
the
state
is
now
paying
the
identical
payment
to
welfare
recipients
in
the
counties
involved
in
this
case.
but
that's
only
because
of
the
injunction.
but
the
1970
legislation,
a
copy
of
which
is
annexed
to
our
reply
brief
which
was
then
superseded
by
a
slightly
different
statute
copies
of
which
we
mailed
to
the
court
last
week
when
it
was
enacted
still
maintains
the
differentials,
only
that
the
figures
are
slightly
different
their
higher
but
the
differential
still
exists
except
in
so
far
as
the
preliminary
injunction
has
eliminated
it
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
right,
your
honor.
except
to
the
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
right.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
philip
weinberg
exactly.
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
statute
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
except
--
except
for
the
commissioner's
discretion
which
he
has
exercised
in
eliminating
the
differential
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
--
and
the
commissioner
by
regulation
in
1969
returned
in
effect
the
three
districts
or
really
four
districts
because
new
york
city
gets
the
statutory
rate.
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
suburban
counties
which
will
previously
lump
in
with
new
york
city.
now,
get
him
out
slightly
lower
than
new
york
city
and
the
two
other
upstate
districts
are
administratively
established
that
is
slightly
lower
rate
than
the
suburban
counties
ringing
new
york
city
and
also
couple
of
upstate
counties
which
were
traditionally
thrown
in
with
these
suburban
counties.
so
that
now
in
effect
they
were
four
rates
subject
only
to
the
injunctions
which
have
thrown
the
suburban
counties
in
with
new
york
city.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
precisely
the
question
mr.
chief
justice,
on
whether
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
sir.
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
still
a
question
of
whether
there's
any
rational
basis
for
the
differential
and
as
we
shall
show
there's
a
more
than
adequate
basis
for
that
differential
for
the
reasons
which
were
reduced
before
the
three-judge
court
in
which
i'd
like
to
expound
on
here.
it
should
be
noted
before
we
turn
to
that
that
these
payments
don't
include
rent
or
fuel
for
heating
and
the
record
shows
that
the
actual
payments
received
by
welfare
recipients
in
new
york
city
for
rent
which
have
paid
over
and
above
these
statutory
or
administratively
set
allowances
are
considerably
higher
in
the
suburban
counties
than
they
are
in
new
york
city.
indeed
as
the
record
show
here,
a
--
the
average
rent
received
by
welfare
family
of
four
in
new
york
city
is
$84.00
a
month.
the
plaintiffs
here
who
are
single
women
just
one
person,
are
getting
a
$105.00
and
$108.00
a
month,
if
my
memory
serves
over
a
hundred
many
event
and
in
nassau
county,
the
record
indicates
that
the
maximum
permissible
payment
for
family
of
four
is
a
$155.00
or
a
$160.00
a
month
depending
on
whether
it
is
an
apartment
or
a
private
house.
but
that
almost
double
the
average
that's
received
in
new
york
city.
this
is
due
to
rent
control
and
i
suppose
to
the
larger
amount
of
apartments
available
in
new
york
city
and
the
general
squeeze
and
housing
in
the
suburban
counties
which
have
grown
so
rapidly
over
the
past
years.
but
in
any
event,
whatever
the
reasons
when
discussing
the
actual
benefits
or
allowances
received
by
welfare
recipient
of
which
shelter
is
obviously
one
of
the
basic
components.
you've
got
to
look
not
only
at
the
welfare
allowance
which
doesn't
include
shelter
but
also
at
the
cost
of
shelter
which
is
also
paid
by
the
commissioner.
and
since
the
cost
of
rental
are
so
much
less
in
new
york
city
and
averages
also
that
in
fact
these
plaintiffs
and
other
similarly
situated
in
nassau
and
westchester
counties
are
actually
receiving
as
much
money
or
perhaps
more
as
people
in
new
york
city.
unfortunately,
the
record
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
i'm
lumping
that
in
with
shelter
fuel
for
heating
is
paid
separately
but
in
many
cases
there's
no
separate
item
for
that.
for
example,
typically
a
welfare
recipient
lives
in
an
apartment
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
--
where
there
is
central
heating
in
so
that
it
wouldn't
come
up
or
even
if
a
welfare
recipient
rented
a
house
they
might
well
or
an
apartment
in
a
house
or
something
that
they
might
will
be
central
heating
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
not
necessarily.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
but
the
heat
is
a
--
it's
he
minimum
item,
it
doesn't
exist
in
most
cases.
in
any
event,
while
we
unfortunately
don't
have
in
the
record
full
statistics
on
the
total
aggregate
amount
of
rental
money
and
fuel
for
heating
paid
in
new
york
city
vis-à-vis
what's
paid
in
the
suburban
counties?
the
record
does
indicate
that
the
average
rental
for
welfare
recipients
in
new
york
city
is
so
much
lower
than
these
plaintiffs
in
particular
received
or
that
the
maximum
permitted
in
nassau
county
and
westchester
is
that
the
record
indicates
plainly
that
fall
from
being
discriminated
against
are
receiving
less
money
when
shelter
is
considered
as
a
certainly
it
should
be.
they're
coming
out
just
as
well
as
a
person
in
new
york
city.
but
over
above
that
the
claim
here
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
also
of
the
social
security
act
and
regulations
there
under.
and
the
court
below,
we
submit
improperly
and
certainly
improperly
in
the
light
of
this
court's
opinion
in
dandridge
bypass
completely
the
social
security
act
and
regulation
claim
and
instead
of
veering
away
from
the
constitutional
issue
as
courts
are
suppose
to.
it
in
effect
veered
toward
it
and
went
out
of
its
way
to
determine
the
constitutional
question
adversely
to
the
state
as
it
happens
and
we
submit
that
reversal
as
required
on
that
ground
alone
over
above
everything
else.
but
this
statute
has
to
be
viewed
whether
we
talked
of
equal
protection
or
the
statute
in
regulation
in
the
context
of
a
statutory
scheme
in
new
york
state
which
traditionally
treats
new
york
city
as
sui
generis
and
indeed
new
york
city
is
a
special
case.
it's
--
it's
the
urban
megalopolis
par
excellence.
it
comprises
half
the
people
in
new
york
state
and
indeed,
more
than
half
of
the
welfare
recipients
about
three-quarters
as
the
record
states
and
the
--
throughout
the
statutes
in
new
york,
we
see
special
treatment
given
new
york
city
far
and
excess
i'm
sure
of
this
special
treatment
given
chicago
or
baltimore
or
philadelphia
in
the
statutes
of
those
states.
indeed,
this
court
itself
in
salzburg
against
maryland
remarked
quoting
an
earlier
case
missouri
against
lewis,
a
19th
century
case
that
it
would
be
permissible
under
the
equal
protection
clause
for
new
york
state
to
apply
the
civil
code,
the
civil
law
in
the
new
york
city
in
common
law
of
the
rest
of
the
state
if
it
wanted
to.
now,
that's
sounds
like
hyperbole
but
this
court
said
it
and
it
quoted
it
salzburg
against
maryland
which
is
a
case
from
the
1950's.
the
fact
is
that
new
york
city
is
different,
it
is
unique,
and
the
legislature
has
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of
that.
the
--
our
brief
and
balance
specific
examples,
for
example
the
multiple
dwelling
law
which
prescribes
all
kinds
of
requirements
for
apartment
houses,
only
applies
to
new
york
city.
there's
a
multiple
residence
law
which
is
entirely
different
which
applies
to
the
apartment
houses
outside
new
york
city.
as
this
court
knows
well
from
the
baldwin
case
which
is
before
it,
the
entire
structure
of
the
penal
law
is
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
is
different
in
new
york
city
and
indeed
this
court
has
before
it
the
question
of
whether
new
york
state
can
permissibly
within
the
equal
protection
clause
give
jury
trials
for
misdemeanors
outside
the
city
and
not
give
them
in
new
york
city.
now,
whatever
the
rights
and
wrongs
are
there.
it's
again
illustrative
of
the
fact
that
the
new
york
legislature
has
traditionally
treated
new
york
city
as
a
very,
very
different
thing
from
the
rest
of
the
state.
now,
when
we
look
at
section
131-a,
we
don't
see
the
enormous
difference
that
we
find
in
these
areas
where
you
talking
about
giving
jury
trials
in
one
place
and
not
somewhere
else
or
having
stringent
requirements
on
multiple
dwellings
in
new
york
city
and
not
having
them
in
the
other
counties
of
the
state.
we're
talking
here
about
a
very
slight
$5.00
a
person
differential
which
the
legislature
which
as
i've
said
it
has
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of
the
specific
local
conditions,
so
fit
to
provide
as
a
benefit
to
compensate
for
the
higher
social
cause
of
urban
living
which
the
new
york
city
welfare
recipient
has
to
endure.
the
question
here
is
this
court
said
is
whether
the
grounds
adopted
by
the
legislature
are
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
states
objective
and
the
--
unless
the
court
can
say
that
they
are
also
wholly
irrelevant
then
it
plainly
has
to
reverse
it
appears.
now
lets
look
at
the
grounds,
these
grounds
are
specific
and
factual.
they're
not
policy
grounds
and
yet
in
dandridge,
this
court
so
fit
to
declare
that
the
maximum
family
rule
in
maryland
which
created
a
real
difference,
a
sizeable
difference
in
the
amount
of
welfare
benefits
received
by
individuals
depending
on
whether
or
not
they
were
in
a
large
family.
it
held
that
that
was
a
permissible
exercise
of
maryland's
legislative
discretion
based
solely
on
maryland's
policy
grounds.
now
here
we
don't
have
policy,
we
have
actual
--
factual
material.
for
example,
we
have
the
rent
control
and
the
actual
lower
rents
within
the
new
york
city
which
i've
already
alluded
to.
in
addition
as
the
record
shows
and
the
studies
on
housing
within
new
york
city
show
because
of
rent
control
and
because
of
the
antiquity
of
much
of
the
housing
in
areas
where
welfare
recipients
have
large
to
live,
there's
been
an
enormous
deterioration
in
the
quality
of
that
housing
and
realistically,
the
legislature
was
entitled
to
find
that
this
entails
the
purchase
of
items
necessary
to
maintain
this
deteriorated
housing
which
might
not
exist
in
suburban
area.
in
addition,
you
have
the
crime
rate
within
new
york
city.
now,
the
statistics
again
within
the
record
and
set
forth
in
our
brief
show
that
the
amount
of
crimes
and
the
amount
of
violent
crimes
specifically
are
far
higher
within
new
york
city
per
capita.
and
once
again,
the
legislature
has
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of
these
factors
and
it
has
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
that
the
higher
crime
rate
which
unfortunately
strikes
people
the
hardest
who
live
in
the
areas,
getaway
areas,
and
low
income
neighborhoods
were
welfare
recipients
for
the
most
part
of
obliged
to
reside.
this
necessitates
taken
a
taxicab
home
at
night.
it
necessitates
buying
lots,
replacing
stolen
goods,
replacing
stolen
monies,
replacing
stolen
welfare
checks.
it's
true
that
new
york
city
does
permit
stolen
welfare
checks
to
be
replaced
if
they're
reported
but
certainly
not
every
stolen
welfare
check
is
reported
and
stolen
goods
and
monies
undoubtedly
are
not
reported
in
the
majority
of
cases.
window
gates
and
bars
and
other
devices
that
are
necessitates
by
a
high
crime
rate
are
simply
effective
life
for
new
york
city
slum
dweller.
and
its
no
doubt
debatable
whether
the
legislature
should
give
more
money
within
its
standard
of
need
to
compensate
the
new
york
city
welfare
recipient
for
these
problems.
but
once
we
concede
that
its
debatable
then
the
equal
protection
clause
doesn't
apply
and
its
simply
becomes
a
matter
of
what
the
three-judge
court
below
did
in
our
judgment
namely
substituting
its
views
on
policy
for
the
legislature's
discretion
in
coping
with
the
realistic
problem
before
it.
what
this
court
characterized
in
dandridge
as
the,
i'm
paraphrasing
the
court,
but
the
extraordinarily
difficult
problem
of
apportioning
or
puzzling
out
to
welfare
recipients
all
of
whom
obviously
need
whatever
the
state
can
afford
to
give
him.
precisely
how
much
this
state
can
give
this
one
and
that
one
and
here
we
repeat
the
differential
was
extremely
slight
compared
to
the
family
maximum
which
this
court
sustained
in
dandridge.
another
fact
which
the
legislature
--
since
it
enacted
this
factor
had
to
be
aware
of
with
the
sales
tax
and
new
york
city
has
a
6%
sales
tax,
3%
state,
and
additional
3%
imposed
by
the
city.
in
nassau,
the
3%
state
sales
tax
applies
to
statewide
of
course
but
in
nassau
county,
the
county
tax
is
only
2%.
in
westchester
county
except
for
one
city,
the
city
of
yonkers,
there's
no
county
tax
at
all.
these
means
and
if
--
in
the
other
suburban
counties,
there's
no
county
tax
or
city
tax
at
all.
these
means
that
on
items
other
than
food
which
welfare
recipient
has
to
buy
clothing,
household
appliances,
and
the
like
to
the
extent
that
this
additional
3%
vis-à-vis
westchester
county
resident
or
1%
vis-à-vis
nassau
county
residents
sales
tax
applies
that
in
it
of
itself
makes
a
difference.
i
refer
the
court
in
our
brief
to
the
fact
that
the
internal
revenue
service
in
its
tax
forms
for
the
year
1969.
so
fit
to
recognize
that
for
a
family
with
an
income
between
$3,000.00
and
$4,000.00
a
year
which
is
the
income
of
family
of
four
on
welfare
in
new
york.
the
sales
tax
allowable
under
the
suggested
permissible
allowances
for
a
sales
tax
deduction
on
income
tax
is
$92.00
for
new
york
city
for
that
family
of
four
at
that
income
level
and
only
$46.00
in
westchester
county.
now,
right
there
you've
got
a
$4.00
a
month
differential.
now,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
this
is
necessarily
binding
on
a
legislature
or
that
they
have
to
abide
by
that.
but
once
we
can
see
that
it
is
debatable
point
then
we've
left
the
equal
protection
clause
far
behind
and
we're
in
the
area
of
legislative
discretion.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
sir.
because
we
have
the
statute
in
regulation
we
chose
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
but
we
do
have
that
and
i
would
like
to
get
to
that.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
certainly
will.
it's
--
it's
interesting
to
learn
of
an
administrative
policy
when
you
pick
up
a
brief
that's
filed
in
this
could.
we
--
weren't
aware
of
this
administrative
policy.
the
letter
sent
by
the
regional
commissioner
of
hew,
mr.
collison
to
commissioner
wyman
back
in
november
said
that
while
there
was
a
differential
and
they
questioned
that
differential.
they
said
that
to
the
extent
that
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
courts
were
different
between
new
york
city
and
the
other
counties,
that
differential
would
be
alright.
now,
commissioner
wyman
didn't
reply
of
the
letter
of
regional
commissioner
because
the
pendency
of
this
lawsuit.
the
commissioner
invited,
commissioner
wyman,
to
indicate
what
the
factual
basis
where
for
the
slight
differential
in
favor
of
new
york
city
welfare
recipients.
and
as
i've
said
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
litigation,
commissioner
wyman
didn't
reply
and
that's
where
the
matter
lay
until
last
week
when
i
got
the
government's
brief
and
i
was
interested
to
learn
that
they
have
a
consistent
administrative
policy
in
this
area.
this
was
fascinating
because
not
only
has
new
york
city
paid
a
different
amount
over
the
years
long
before
the
adoption
of
this
section.
they
had
as
we've
been
indicated
three
separate
areas
within
the
state.
but
as
i
learned
in
the
dandridge
case
the
city
of
baltimore
pays
$10.00
a
month
more
than
the
rest
of
maryland.
i
should
say
the
state
of
maryland
pays
people
in
baltimore
$10.00
a
month
more
and
as
we
discovered
in
our
research
and
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
state
of
california
has
a
whole
crazy
quilt
of
amounts
paid
it
varies
with
the
contribution
of
the
county
wants
to
make
and
their
enormous
differences.
and
of
course,
once
we
look
beyond
state
boarders
and
we
start
looking
to
what
happens
between
one
state
another
state.
then
the
difference
has
become
enormous
and
without
even
discussing
the
differences
in
wealth
they
are
paid
between
the
states
like
new
york
and
the
southern
states,
right
on
the
northeastern
states
where
the
standard
of
living
is
about
the
same
on
the
states
that
you
pass
through
taking
the
train
from
new
york
to
washington.
you'll
see
that
the
level
of
payments
in
wilmington,
delaware
with
the
standard
of
living
can't
be
very
different
from
new
york
city
or
philadelphia.
the
welfare
payment
is
about
half
what
it
is
in
new
york
city
and
philadelphia
it's
a
lot
lower
than
this
in
new
york
city.
so,
since
the
federal
government
and
specifically
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
is
the
agency
that's
suppose
to
administer
all
these
and
try
to
make
assemblance
of
order.
it
appears
to
us
that
the
straining
at
gnats
when
they
get
all
excited
about
$5.00
a
month
between
new
york
city
and
the
suburbs
around
it
and
they're
perfectly
willing
to
let
all
the
rest
to
just
go
by.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
hew,
mr.
justice
black,
resisted
the
urged
to
talk
about
equal
protection
and
they
confined
themselves
to
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
although,
they
said
quite
astonishingly
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
regulation
went
further
than
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
struck
me
as
odd
and
i
think
it
will
strike
anyone
as
odd
who
looks
at
it.
the
regulation
simply
says
there
has
to
be
a
statewide
standard
of
need
which
new
york
concededly
has
that's
admitted
by
hew.
mr.
philip
weinberg
mr.
justice
black,
they
appear
to
be
saying
that
the
use
of
the
words
objective
and
equitable
in
their
regulation
require
the
state
to
pay
the
precise
mathematical
same
figure
in
every
part
of
the
state.
unless
they
can
come
forward
and
show
that
there's
a
demonstrable
difference.
now,
we
maintain
that
we're
doing
that.
we're
showing
that
there's
a
demonstrable
difference
but
the
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
that's
precisely
why
i
say
they
are
straining
it
gnats
here.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
i
can't
speak
for
them
mr.
justice
black.
they
don't
--
they
don't
say
anything
about
that
in
their
brief.
all
they
say
is
that
they
want
new
york
state
to
pay
the
precise
same
dollar
amount
throughout
the
state.
otherwise,
they
are
violating
the
regulation
which
talks
about
an
objective
and
equitable
standard
but
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
unless
the
--
unless
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
there
is
an
objective
difference
even
that
which
there
own
regional
commissioner
collison
said,
they
appear
to
be
backing
away
from
because
when
you
read
their
brief
they
seem
to
require
a
--
a
mathematical
precision
and
the
payment
throughout
the
state.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
statewide
standard
of
need
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
--
that
the
dollar
amount
paid
throughout
the
state
has
to
be
identical.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
regional
--
the
regional
commissioner
conceded
in
this
letter
of
november
10,
1969
which
is
appended
to
their
brief
and
it's
in
the
appendix
and
it's
appended
to
the
plaintiff's
brief
as
well.
they
said
in
there
that
if
there's
a
demonstrable
difference
then
we're
not
violating
that
regulation
or
that
statute.
and
throughout
the
years
we
had
three
different
standards
varying
between
new
york
city
and
the
suburban
counties
which
used
to
be
lumped
together
until
1969,
then
a
batch
up
of
counties
and
then
another
group
of
upstate
counties.
now,
probably
that
was
alright
with
hew.
maryland
giving
people
in
baltimore
$10.00
a
month
is
alright
with
hew.
the
variation
as
between
the
states
which
have
paid
for
half
by
federal
money
alright
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
the
regional
commissioner
didn't
insist
it.
as
i
read
their
brief
i'm
a
little
unclear
as
to
whether
they're
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
oh,
i'd
like
to
read
the
brief
that
way
mr.
justice
white
and
if
we
can
read
it
that
way.
then,
i
think
with
all
due
respect
the
new
york
is
home
free
because
we've
shown
that
there
is
that
demonstrable
standard.
at
least
it's
debatable
and
once
it's
debatable
that
regulation
certainly
can
impose
any
greater
requirements
on
new
york
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
uses
words
like
objective
and
equitable
and
that
can
mean
anything
more
than
equal
protection
clause
means.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that
appears
to
be
what
they're
saying.
but
when
you
look
at
the
reasons
for
the
slight
differential
in
favor
of
new
york
city,
we
see
that
the
legislature
in
fact
have
valid
reasons.
it
had
the
deterioration
of
housing,
the
higher
crime
rate,
the
higher
sales
tax,
and
one
which
was
testified
to
by
the
commissioner
which
i
didn't
get
to
yet.
and
namely
the
fact
that
the
best
bulk,
the
overwhelming
preponderance
of
welfare
monies
are
paid
under
the
afdc
program.
and
that
means
that
most
welfare
recipients
in
new
york
as
in
other
states
are
children
and
the
--
where
the
social
cost
of
urban
living
hits
home
is
to
the
child
on
afdc
living
typically
in
new
york
city.
unfortunately,
in
a
tenement
of
and
in
areas
remote
from
a
park
as
our
brief
indicates
there
are
huge
areas
in
bronx
county
particularly
which
has
a
high
number
of
welfare
recipients
where
there
simply
no
folk
around
from
miles.
this
necessitates
the
parent
taking
the
child
on
public
transportation
and
bringing
him
to
a
park
or
to
the
zoos
in
museums
and
aquariums
and
other
facilities,
beaches
which
are
available
to
the
--
in
new
york
city,
and
which
a
part
of
urban
living.
now
in
the
suburbs,
we're
not
about
to
suggest
that
life
in
the
suburbs
where
an
afdc
child
is
rosy
but
there's
more
room
around
and
the
legislature
had
a
right
to
find
that
a
child
on
welfare
in
nassau
or
westchester
county
is
a
lot
more
right
to
have
some
kind
of
a
vacant
lot
around
than
a
child
in
tenement
and
hold
them
with
the
self
bronx.
and
for
this
--
and
also
the
zoos
and
beaches
and
so
on
which
existed
in
new
york
city
are
simply
inaccessible
in
nassau
county.
so,
this
is
another
item
which
the
legislature
and
its
discretion
had
a
right
to
consider.
we're
not
saying
that
that
every
member
of
this
court
are
indeed
any
member
of
this
court
has
to
necessarily
agree
with
what
the
legislature
said
in
everyone
of
these
instances
or
any
of
these
instances.
but
there
has
to
be
an
ambit
or
scope
of
legislative
discretion
and
these
are
factual
things
here.
they're
not
--
they're
not
policy
things
such
as
maryland
advanced
successfully
in
the
dandridge
case.
these
are
factual
things
which
the
legislature
and
the
commissioner
who
has
the
expertise
and
the
core
of
civil
service
people
or
staff
who
would
administers
this
program
have
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of.
now,
the
commissioner
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
oh,
i
think
they
meld
or
dovetail,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
standard
the
regulation
is
objective
and
equitable,
and
when
one
reads
that
together
with
the
statute
which
speaks
of
the
statewide
standard
of
need.
i
think
we're
--
we're
roughly
in
the
same
territories
the
equal
protection
clause
which
says
that
there
has
to
be
rational
standard
for
the
legislature.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
sir.
i
agreed
but
we
think
that
the
where
the
legislature
has
the
demonstrable
standard.
the
very
language
that
the
regional
commissioner
of
hew
talked
about
that
they're
both
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
both
under
the
test
on
the
under
regulation
of
objective
and
equitable.
this
--
their
existence
adequate
ground
from
the
differential,
but
we
note
that
the
three-judge
court
didn't
look
at
that
way
at
all.
they
bypassed
the
statutory
and
regulatory
ground
and
they
--
as
we've
indicated
they
veered
toward
the
constitutional
ground.
it's
that
right
off
the
back,
it
would
appear
that
the
sweeping
injunctions
granted
below
have
to
be
reversed.
but
we
submit
that
a
remand
for
the
purpose
of
considering
the
statutory
and
regulatory
ground
wouldn't
served
any
useful
purpose
here
because
the
scope
or
the
ambit
of
discretion
within
which
the
state
legislature
was
allowed
under
that
test
seems
to
be
about
the
same
as
the
government
in
effect
says
in
its
brief
as
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
indeed
as
their
commissioner
said
that
to
the
extent
they
are
demonstrable
differences
the
differential
will
be
justified
as
indeed
they've
justified
differentials
in
new
york,
maryland,
and
california,
and
for
awhile
in
other
states
over
the
years.
mr.
philip
weinberg
they
appear
--
they
appear
sir
to
be
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
they
appear
to
be
saying
sir
that
there
were
no
objective
standards
under
which
the
legislature
pays
a
differential
to
people
in
new
york
city
who
are
in
welfare.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
they're
suggesting
that
it's
discriminatory
or
that
it's
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
--
it's
invidious.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
honor
that
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
statute
which
says
that
there
has
to
be
statewide
standard
of
need
and
the
hew
regulation
which
says
that
the
standard
of
need
and
the
amounts
paid
have
to
be
objective
equitable
throughout
the
state.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
think
they're
saying
that
to
the
extent
that
we
can
demonstrate
that
there's
a
valid
reason
to
pay
people
in
new
york
city
more
then
we
don't
violate
the
statute
or
the
regulation,
to
the
extent
that
we
can't
show
such
a
valid
reason
and
we
do
violate
the
statute
in
there
regulation.
but
the
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
exactly,
sir.
and
over
and
above
that,
we
point
out
that
the
injunctions
granted
below
were
not
granted
on
the
statutory
ground
with
the
three-judge
court
so
fit
to
ignore.
they
were
granted
on
the
constitutional
ground
and
the
way
they
phrase
their
border
than
what
this
court
permits
and
permitted
under
the
rosado
case
for
example,
in
issuing
an
injunction
where
the
only
ground
statutory
and
not
constitutional.
the
most
this
court
did
in
rosado
where
there
was
a
violation
found
of
a
--
of
an
act
of
congress
was
to
remand
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
to
give
new
york
state
the
choice
of
letting
federal
funds
go
or
of
redrafting
the
statute.
and
we
submit
that
the
three-judge
court
below
didn't
do
anything
like
that
for
the
good
reason
or
at
least
for
the
reason
that
they
didn't
take
the
statutory
route.
they
took
the
constitutional
route
and
for
this
reason,
i
think
this
court
can
pass
on
both
the
constitutional
ground
and
the
statutory
ground
and
find
that
--
as
this
court
said
in
dandridge
that
there
isn't
anything
special
about
welfare
statutes
which
requires
a
more
rigorous
constitutional
standards
to
be
employed
as
in
cases
involving
racial
discrimination
or
the
right
to
vote
or
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech.
the
dandridge
certainly
laid
that
argument
to
rest
and
that's
the
keystone
of
the
whole
argument
adopted
by
the
three-judge
court
and
i
think
once
we
remove
that
keystone,
there's
not
much
left
to
support
those
injunctions.
the
statute
and
regulation,
i
never
even
consider
so
at
the
very
least
of
remand
is
required
but
we
go
further
than
that
and
we
say
that
the
complaint
should
be
simply
dismissed.
and
that
summary
judgment
should
be
granted
and
in
our
favor
because
the
requisite
demonstrable
differences
have
been
shown
to
exist.
and
whether
we're
talking
about
equal
protection
or
the
statute
or
the
regulation,
new
york
state
has
demonstrated
that
it
had
a
demonstrable
reason
a
rational
basis
for
the
determination
that
legislature
made.
and
it
--
and
i
should
add
the
determination
that
the
commissioner
made
in
which
he
reduced
the
size
of
the
disparity
to
approximately
half.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
we
are.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
correct
of
course.
but
we
submit
that
the
facts
are
basically
before
this
court
and
this
isn't
the
kind
of
disputed
issue
effect
which
lends
itself
to
a
trial.
although,
if
the
court
orders
a
trial
we'll
have
one
i
suppose
if
the
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
there
was
a
deposition
of
the
commissioner.
there
was
an
affidavit
of
a
one
of
the
men
on
his
staff
and
the
rest
of
facts
which
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
such
as
the
existence
of
rent
control,
the
higher
crime
rate,
the
sales
tax
and
things
of
that
nature.
the
once
that
the
court
can't
take
judicial
notice
of
such
as
the
higher
cost
of
living
to
the
trial
on
afdc
in
the
city
or
testified
to
by
commissioner
wyman
and
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
murphy,
a
member
of
commissioner
wyman's
staff.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
it
added
--
it
said
that
mr.
justice
black
and
i
added
the
words,
and
i'm
paraphrasing
it,
unless
objective
criteria
can
be
demonstrated
or
something
like
that
but
nevertheless
the
injunctions
in
effect.
and
while
the
injunction
was
issued
by
the
three-judge
court
on
a
finding
that
these
plaintiffs
weren't
people
on
afdc
and
therefore,
our
whole
argument
about
children
on
afdc
didn't
apply
to
this
disabled
ladies
who
presumably
don't
want
to
go
to
the
park
or
the
zoo
and
so
on.
they
nonetheless
permitted
intervention
by
people
on
afdc.
so
that
now
the
injunction
applies
to
everyone
on
welfare
within
those
states.
mr.
philip
weinberg
it
orders
new
york
to
pay
the
same
amount
of
money
to
people
in
the
suburban
counties
as
to
those
in
new
york
city
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no.
in
the
suburban
counties
around
new
york
city,
nassau,
westchester
and
the
six
other
counties
which
the
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
it
names
the
counties.
unless
we
can
show
that
objective
criteria
exists
other
than
in
a
court
in
accordance
of
objective
criteria.
so
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
if
we
have
the
opportunity.
we'll
try
to
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
think
that
we've
shown
enough
here
to
set
aside
the
preliminary
injunctions
and
to
grant
summary
judgment
in
our
favor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may
in
hopes
that
we
won't
impose
on
the
court
for
tomorrow.
mr.
philip
weinberg
they
showed
that
the
actual
cost
of
living
of
individual
items,
the
loaf
of
the
bread
and
the
bottle
of
milk
were
and
i
suppose
a
pair
of
trousers
and
so
on
that
people
have
to
buy
were
the
same
in
new
york
city
as
they
are
in
nassau
county.
and
that's
not
in
dispute,
they
are.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we
combat
that
sir
by
suggesting
that
that's
not
the
only
thing
that
a
welfare
department
has
to
concern
itself
with
in
paying
these
allowances.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
rent
is
separate
as
we've
been
indicated.
rent
is
higher
in
the
suburban
counties
because
of
rent
control.
and
because
there's
more
housing
available
in
new
york
city
so
that
rent
is
entirely
different
but
of
the
factors
outside
of
shelter.
the
essence
of
their
proof
is
that
the
bread
and
milk
and
so
on,
and
clothing
specific
items
the
toaster
cost
the
same
in
the
new
york
city
as
they
do
in
nassau
county.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
but
we
don't
think
that
resolves
the
case.
we
certainly
don't
think
that
that
in
of
itself
demonstrates
that
the
legislature
was
so
irrational
and
seemed
fit
to
give
these
people,
the
new
york
city,
$5.00
a
month
a
person
more.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
don't
think
a
fact
--
a
group
of
elements
like
that
lends
itself
a
whole
a
configuration
of
factors
lends
itself
to
precise
computation.
i
don't
think
this
is
like
a
--
let
say
a
negligence
case
or
a
case
where
you
have
to
appraise
the
value
of
a
piece
of
property.
the
legislature
has
a
right
in
its
discretion
to
consider
a
lot
of
factors.
some
of
which
aren't
very
tangible
and
some
of
which
are
very
difficult
to
put
a
dollar
and
cent
sign
on.
mr.
philip
weinberg
a
court
would
be
the
proper
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
--
a
court
would
be
the
proper
forum
if
we
transgress
the
equal
protection
clause.
for
example,
that
we
pay
people
of
one
race
more
than
people
of
another
race,
or
we
did
something
that
was
so
totally
out
of
line
that
there
was
just
no
way
to
justify
it.
like
paying
people
in
new
york
city
three
times
what
we
paid
people
on
long
island.
but
so
long
as
we're
in
the
area
of
a
slight
differential
and
so
long
as
we've
come
forward
with
cogent
reasons
for
what
we
did.
we
say
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
satisfied
and
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
regulations
satisfied.
and
consequently,
the
injunction
should
be
set
aside
and
this
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
i
haven't
touch
on
the
unripeness
of
this
case.
it's
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i'll
refer
to
it
on
my
rebuttal
time
defending,
if
i
may?
thank
you
very
much
for
the
opportunity.
mr.
philip
weinberg
thank
you
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
short
answer
to
mr.
strauss’
argument
about
albeit
the
district
court
started
of
on
the
wrong
foot,
why
don’t
we
simply
take
it
the
other
way
and
affirm
the
injunction
anyway
because
they’re
probably
right
about
the
statutory
ground
as
well.
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
the
sweeping
injunctions
that
were
granted
below
aren’t
supported
by
the
statutory
ground.
and
this
court’s
decision
in
rosado
makes
that
clear
because
what
the
court
did
below
was
issue
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
statute
at
all
unless
it
were
corrected
and
objectives
--
what
they
thought
were
objective
standards
were
imposed,
which
would
have
been
a
valid
injunction
under
the
equal
protection
clause
assuming
a
violation
of
that
clause
had
been
shown.
the
language
is,
other
--
they’re
enjoined
from
enforcing
this
statute
at
all
other
than
according
to
objective,
non-discriminatory
standards
based
upon
the
cost
of
the
needs
of
such
recipients.
now,
a
statutory
nonconformity
as
in
rosado
doesn’t
support
any
such
injunction,
and
indeed
this
court,
rosado
made
that
clear.
the
most
that
could
be
done
there
would
be
a
remand
to
the
district
court
to
what
--
assuming
that
the
probabilities
were
that
the
hew
is
right
and
we
were
wrong
about
the
statutory
argument,
the
most
that
could
be
done
would
be
to
remand
the
case
of
district
court
for
a
much
more
narrow
injunction
such
as
the
one
this
court
discussed
in
rosado.
now,
over
and
above
that
when
we
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
precisely.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
they
started
off
on
the
wrong
foot.
they
aimed
toward
the
constitutional
ground
and
they
did
just
what
this
court
in
dandridge
said
they
shouldn’t
do
and
what
we
cited
earlier
cases
suggesting
that
they
not
do,
namely
they
decided
the
constitutional
issue
and
let
the
statutory
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
mr.
justice
white,
the
--
this
court
in
rosado
indicated
that
in
a
nonconformity
situation
which
is
what
that
would
be,
the
most
that
could
be
fashioned
would
be
an
injunction
against
that
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
against
the
nonconformity
or
against
the
receipt
of
the
federal
funds
by
the
state
of
new
york.
indeed
in
rosado,
the
plaintiffs
wanted
all
along
that
the
statute
be
enjoined
for
nonconformity
and
that
although
the
court
agreed
with
them
on
the
merits,
the
court
didn’t
grant
such
an
injunction.
and
in
rosado
it
specifically
sent
the
case
back
to
district
court
in
brooklyn
to
fashion
--
to
see
what
the
state
would
in
1970
first
of
all,
which
is
not
applicable
here
but
the
point
is
that
even
if
the
state
remained
in
the
nonconformity,
this
court’s
opinion
in
rosado
seem
to
make
it
clear
that
the
most
could
be
an
injunction
against
the
receipt
of
federal
funds,
if
we
remained
in
nonconformity.
mr.
philip
weinberg
precisely.
mr.
philip
weinberg
unless
the
state
board
itself
into
conformity
assuming
the
court
ruled
that
it
was
out
of
conformity
but
that’s
a
far
different
sort
of
injunction
from
the
injunctions
that
were
granted
below.
mr.
philip
weinberg
not
to
my
knowledge.
of
course,
every
change
that’s
ever
made
or
any
claim
or
standard
of
need
has
to
conform
to
federal
law
and
there
you
have
to
be
submitted
to
hew.
mr.
philip
weinberg
to
my
knowledge,
no.
mr.
philip
weinberg
again
to
my
knowledge,
no.
as
i’ve
said
they’ve
--
as
i
indicated
yesterday
they
permitted
the
maryland
and
california
disparities
which
mr.
strauss
just
discussed
to
continue
over
the
years.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed
and
they
can
compel
that.
when
we
look
at
the
standard
of
need,
we
see
that
in
fact
new
york
has
one
standard
of
need
and
it’s
the
same
throughout
the
state
just
as
the
federal
statute
says
it
must
be.
this
isn't
a
case
where
we
have
one
standard
of
need
for
the
city
and
one
for
outside
the
city,
although
the
government
tries
to
paint
it
that
way.
it’s
simply
isn’t
so.
the
standard
of
need
isn't
in
statutory
in
new
york
--
it’s
administrative.
it’s
prepared
by
commissioner
wieman,
by
the
department
of
social
services
and
it
lists
the
various
components
of
that
standard
of
needs;
food,
household
appliances,
shelter,
although
rent
is
paid
separately,
clothing,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
but
it
would
be
simply
contrary
to
reality
to
expect
that
every
welfare
recipients
or
indeed
any
welfare
recipient
adhere
so
precisely
to
that
standard
of
need
which
tells
them
how
many
razorblades
he
has
to
buy
in
the
course
of
the
year
and
how
many
newspaper,
and
so
on,
obviously,
there’s
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
in
the
standard
of
need.
the
state
arise
that
it
figured
that
they
consider
to
be
an
approximation
of
what
the
social
realities
are,
and
then
they
give
that
money
to
a
welfare
recipient
and
he’s
presumed
to
purchase
with
that
money
what
he
has
to
buy.
nobody
is
there
to
make
sure
that
he
buys
a
newspaper
everyday
or
a
razorblade
three
times
a
week
or
whatever
the
standard
of
need
happens
to
work
out.
that’s
an
administrative
averaging
process,
and
if
the
standard
of
need
in
new
york
city
doesn’t
list
buying
the
lock
for
door,
or
a
window
guard,
if
a
persons
lives
in
a
bad
neighborhood,
or
if
he
doesn’t
say
anything
about
taxi
cabs,
well
the
fact
that
there’s
a
higher
sales
tax
in
new
york
city,
it’s
simply
flies
in
the
face
of
reality
to
expect
that
welfare
recipients
aren’t
going
to
nevertheless
buy
locks
if
they
need
locks.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
know
that
very
justice
marshall.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
they
do
but
the
legislature
was
entitled
to
find
that
statistically
comparing
new
york
city
with
its
enormously
high
crime
rate
and
narcotic
addiction
and
all
the
rest
with
the
rest
of
the
state
taken
as
a
whole
and
they
saw
fit
to
draw
the
line
at
that
particular
point,
that
problem
was
greater
in
new
york.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
they
could
have
drawn
the
line
to
say
cities
over
a
hundred
thousand
people.
well,
they
could
have
drawn
westchester
in
with
new
york,
but
they
didn’t.
it's
a
--
again
we’re
in
the
area
which
where
a
legislature
has
to
have
some
discretion
or
it
doesn't
have
any
discretion
at
all.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
the
legislature
saw
fit
to
do
so.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
they
did.
now
crime
isn’t
the
only
component
of
that.
for
example,
the
utility
rate
is
lower
in
the
western
of
state
than
it
is
in
new
york.
mr.
philip
weinberg
utilities,
no.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
utilities
are
the
same
in
the
new
york
area.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
evidence
in
the
record
indicates
that
it
is
but
the
legislature
found
that
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
legislature
found
that
the
new
york
city
child
on
afdc
has
a
greater
need
to
avail
himself
and
his
parents
also
to
avail
themselves
of
the
municipal
transportation
system
in
taking
their
child
to
a
park
or
a
zoo
which
in
new
york
city
to
a
ghetto
resident
is
up
to
not
be
near
where
he
lives.
mr.
philip
weinberg
now
that
might
well
also
be
true
in
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
they
might
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
question
about
it
mr.
justice
marshall
but
this
is
a
legislative
determination
based
on
discretion
and
some
of
these
things
are
simply
factual,
such
as
the
sales
tax
about
which
there
is
little
dispute.
and
others
are
perhaps
more
debatable
but
as
long
as
reasonable
people
can
differ
about
them
then
i
don’t
see
how
were
--
how
the
legislature
can
be
held
to
have
transgressed
the
equal
protection
clause
or
not
have
a
statewide
standard
of
need,
the
fashion
and
after
objective
and
equitable
standards
which
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we
maintain
this
as
we
have
throughout
that
the
district
court
improperly
went
to
the
equal
protection
arguments.
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
statutory
argument
obviously
is
different
--
different
and
as
we’ve
indicated
it
won’t
support
the
injunction
that
was
granted
below.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that’s
very
true.
but
hew
has
never
said
we’re
not
in
compliance
except
in
effect
in
their
brief
in
this
court.
the
letter
from
their
commissioner
which
is
the
only
evidence
otherwise
that
we
have
indicates
that
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
we
are,
because
--
well,
let
me
rephrase
it
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
white,
varies
with
the
item
we’re
talking
about
in
the
case
of
the
locks,
and
window
guards,
and
taxi
rides,
and
the
other
things
that
go
with
the
higher
crime
rate
in
the
new
york
city
ghettos
and
that’s
a
matter
of
fact,
i
mean
no
doubt
this
crime
in
buffalo
and
in
yonkers
and
we’re
not
going
to
suggest
that
there
isn’t,
but
statistically
it’s
enormously
greater
in
new
york
than
it
is
in
the
rest
of
the
state
if
you
make
that
division.
and
the
case
of
those
things
no
doubt
a
lot
would
cost
the
same
wherever
you
bought
one
but
if
you
don’t
need
a
lock
living
in
a
small
town,
or
if
you
needed
even
less
in
a
suburb
and
you
needed
more
in
new
york
city,
the
legislature
has
a
right
to
take
that
into
account
and
give
the
new
york
city
welfare
recipient
a
little
bit
more
money
for
that
cab
ride,
for
that
lock
to
pay
the
sales
tax
which
concededly
doesn’t
exist
in
these
are
the
places.
mr.
philip
weinberg
precisely.
mr.
philip
weinberg
not
because
any
individual
items
except
for
the
sales
tax
cost
more,
but
the
components
that
go
into
a
person’s
way
of
life
simply
require
more
money
in
new
york
city.
a
standard
of
need
isn’t
some
kind
of
an
ironclad
procrustean
thing,
as
i
tried
to
indicate
in
mentioning
razorblades
and
things
like
that.
a
welfare
recipient
has
to
buy
what
he
needs
in
order
to
survive
and
if
the
legislature
found
that
it
takes
more
in
new
york
city
then
certainly
it
didn’t
have
to
so
find
that’s
debatable,
but
how
can
it
not
be
objective
and
equitable
for
them
so
find
and
how
can
it
be
a
violation
of
a
statute
saying
they
have
to
have
a
statewide
standard
of
need
when
they
have
a
statewide
standard
of
need.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
think
it’s
obvious
that
there’s
a
higher
crime
rate
and
sales
tax
in
new
york
city,
the
other
factors
aren’t
so
obvious
and
then
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
we
never
got
very
far
in
the
dialog
with
hew
because
all
that
ever
happened
was
their
regional
commissioner
callison
wrote
us
a
letter
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
that’s
true,
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
litigation,
but
as
the
government
indicated
lower
level
discussions
have
been
going
on,
we’ve
never
heard
a
definite
pronouncement
from
hew
except
for
the
brief
that
they
filed
here.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we’ve
been
trying
to
demonstrate
it
all
along.
we’ve
certainly
prepared
to
demonstrate
it
whether
before
hew
or
before
the
district
court.
we’ve
attempted
to
demonstrate
here
to
the
extent
necessary
to
reverse
these
injunctions
that
these
things
are
debatable.
i’m
not
suggesting
that
they’re
obvious
certainly
reasonable
minds
can
differ
in
as
mr.
justice
marshall
indicated
in
his
earlier
questioning
that
certain
things
may
not
be
necessary
for
certain
people
and
perhaps
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
we’re
immune
from
litigation
on
this
point
if
we
had
it
a
patently
arbitrary
standard
then
we
wouldn’t
make
the
statutory
criterion?
mr.
philip
weinberg
oh
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
i
think
that’s
why
hew
wants
a
conformity
hearing
to
the
extent
that
--
but
it
seems
to
me
when
you
look
at
the
words
objective
and
equitable
which
are
employed
in
the
hew
regulations,
they’re
really
imposing
their
own
reasonable
man
test.
now,
perhaps
at
a
conformity
hearing,
they
would
have
the
last
word,
these
are
the
states
subject
to
the
states
appeal
through
the
courts
but
they’re
imposing
their
own
reasonable
man
test.
special
grants
are
an
individual
thing
and
in
the
rosado
case
this
court
may
quite
a
point
of
saying
that
individual
special
grants
were
important.
indeed
this
court
noted
that
new
york
city
lost
its
special
advantage
which
it
previously
had
when
individual
grants
were
eliminated
in
rosado.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
agree.
all
congress
said,
it
was
that
there
has
to
be
a
uniform
statewide
plan.
mr.
philip
weinberg
right.
mr.
philip
weinberg
we’ve
talked
about
the
question
of
whether
new
york
was
arbitrary
or
within
the
embed
of
the
legislatures
permissible
discretion
because
the
injunction
we’re
appealing
was
based
solely
under
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
as
to
that
even
if
it
is,
we
submit
the
injunction
still
have
to
be
reversed
and
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
agree
that’s
a
separate
issue.
and
as
to
the
propriety
of
hew’s
used
when
the
wrong
regulations
used
words
like
objective
and
equitable,
no
doubt
you’ve
got
give
the
practical
--
the
benefit
of
the
practical
construction
of
the
statute
that
an
administrative
agency
administering
a
system
is
entitled
to
one
of
the
cases,
although
here,
it’s
an
awkward
here
as
we
indicated
yesterday
that
there’s
no
long
consistent
history
of
construction.
in
fact
they’ve
ignored
this
problem
until
this
case
and
get
ordered
in
this
until
the
appeal
came
to
this
court.
they
weren’t
heard
from
in
the
district
court.
mr.
philip
weinberg
there’s
also
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
question
of
whether
a
violation
of
the
regulation
alone
and
the
regulation
uses
the
words
objective
and
equitable
would
constitute
nonconformity.
that’s
not
nonconformity
with
an
act
of
congress
as
we
had
in
rosado
or
in
king
against
smith.
that’s
merely
a
regulation
and
--
i
question
again
as
we
indicated
in
our
reply
brief
whether
that
would
be
sufficient
to
grant
this
injunction
or
any
injunction
for
that
matter.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
the
injunction
below
was
based
solely
on
the
equal
protection
clause
the
court
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
didn’t
they
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
we
say
that
a
legislature
has
to
have
discretion
to
deal
with
these
problems
as
it
sees
fit
and
that
what
the
court
below
did
just
as
plain
as
day,
mr.
justice
black
was
to
substitute
its
own
views
on
policy
for
what
the
constitution
commands.
mr.
philip
weinberg
it
certainly
would.
that
was
just
our
point
and
we’ve
kept
--
we’ve
kept
try
to
keep
in
focus
throughout
this
appeal
that
that
was
the
ground
on
which
the
court
below
acted.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
think
there’s
365
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
don’t
think
it’s
an
issue
that
belongs
in
this
court
barring
some
discrimination
on
the
ground
of
[inaudible]
they’re
obvious
basis
like
that.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that’s
exactly
our
point
here.
we
think
the
legislature
had
a
right
to
make
a
findings
such
as
it
did
that
based
on
certain
things
which
are
somewhat
intangible
in
some
instances
and
quite
tangible
like
a
sales
tax
and
other
instances,
had
a
right
to
find
that
the
ghetto
resident,
the
welfare
recipient
in
new
york
city
was
entitled
to
a
little
bit
extra
compensate
with
those
factors.
and
it’s
ironic
that
this
litigation
came
up
at
a
time
when
every
enlightened
social
commentator
was
asking
people
to
do
more
about
the
cities
and
to
concern
themselves
with
the
problems
of
the
urban
core.
mr.
philip
weinberg
mr.
justice
black
we’ve
tried
to
indicate
throughout
that
we
don’t
think
the
equal
protection
clause
reaches
that
far
unless
if
where
a
case
of
something
like
racial
discrimination
or
just
complete
patent
arbitrariness
where
the
state
just
didn’t
come
forward
with
anything
at
all.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
they
certainly
did.
they
completely
violated
what
this
court
said
in
dandridge
and
what
this
court
has
said
earlier
in
cases
like
mcdonald
which
we
cited
to
them.
mr.
philip
weinberg
in
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
yes
sir,
i
believe
so
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
it
would
be
an
appeal
from
the
hew
determination
through
the
courts
it
would
be,
i
assume
a
single-judge
district
court
along,
i’m
frankly
not
sure.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
precisely.
and
for
all
of
those
reasons,
we
submit
that
these
injunction
should
be
reversed
for
the
reasons
we’ve
suggested.
mr.
philip
weinberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
raises
the
question
whether
when
a
time
when
urban
problems
are
recognized
by
virtually
every
thoughtful
person
in
every
social
commentator
examining
american
life
to
be
of
the
most
serious
proportions.
the
state
of
new
york
made
out
employee;
it's
concededly
limited
resources
in
the
field
of
social
welfare
in
such
a
way
as
to
address
itself
to
these
problems
with
slightly
greater
emphasis.
now,
131-a
of
the
social
services
law
of
new
york
which
is
the
statute
of
this
case
is
all
about
provides
levels
of
welfare
allowances
for
welfare
recipients
in
the
state
of
new
york.
it
was
enacted
by
the
1969
legislature
and
as
i'm
sure
the
court
knows
it
was
the
same
statute
that
was
involved
in
rosado
against
wyman
which
this
court
decided
in
april
6.
section
131-a
establishes
levels
at
one
rate
for
welfare
recipients
within
new
york
city
and
it
is
slightly
lower
rate
approximately
$5.00
a
person
for
welfare
recipients
living
outside
new
york
city.
it
then
goes
on
to
give
the
appellant,
commissioner
wyman,
the
state
commissioner
of
social
services,
discretion
under
an
amendment
which
was
passed
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
131-a,
which
was
july
1,
1969,
discretion
to
increase
the
payments
in
any
county
upon
the
request
of
that
county
or
indeed
without
the
request
of
that
county
if
the
facts
warrant
and
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
statute.
commissioner
wyman
did
indeed
exercise
that
discretion
and
he
have
the
differential
between
the
new
york
city
welfare
payments
and
the
welfare
payments
in
the
suburban
counties
including
nassau
and
westchester
counties
which
are
adjacent
to
new
york,
essentially
suburban
counties
and
which
the
two
counties
in
which
the
plaintiff
here
reside.
it
has
to
be
presumed
as
this
court
has
stated
on
many
occasions
that
the
state
legislature
acted
with
that
knowledge
of
local
conditions
and
indeed
the
assemblymen
and
state
senators
who
passed
this
section
of
the
social
services
law
are
elected
from
very
small
districts.
they're
about
as
close
to
their
local
constituencies
as
any
elected
representative
can
be.
their
district
is
so
much
smaller
and
they
represent
less
people
than
a
congressman,
and
they
have
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of
local
conditions.
indeed,
it's
noteworthy
that
the
assemblyman
from
nassau
and
westchester
counties
predominantly
voted
for
this
bill.
now,
where
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
which
differential
was
i
have
indicated
halved
by
the
administrative
action
of
the
appellant
commissioner
wyman
before
the
bill
took
effect.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
1970
legislature
reenacted
section
131-a
with
increase
levels
but
they
maintained
the
differential
so
that
the
case
isn't
moot.
the
differential
still
exists
except
that
as
a
result
of
the
very
sweeping
preliminary
injunctions
issued
by
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
case
the
state
is
now
paying
the
identical
payment
to
welfare
recipients
in
the
counties
involved
in
this
case.
but
that's
only
because
of
the
injunction.
but
the
1970
legislation,
a
copy
of
which
is
annexed
to
our
reply
brief
which
was
then
superseded
by
a
slightly
different
statute
copies
of
which
we
mailed
to
the
court
last
week
when
it
was
enacted
still
maintains
the
differentials,
only
that
the
figures
are
slightly
different
their
higher
but
the
differential
still
exists
except
in
so
far
as
the
preliminary
injunction
has
eliminated
it
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
right,
your
honor.
except
to
the
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
right.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
philip
weinberg
exactly.
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
statute
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
except
--
except
for
the
commissioner's
discretion
which
he
has
exercised
in
eliminating
the
differential
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
--
and
the
commissioner
by
regulation
in
1969
returned
in
effect
the
three
districts
or
really
four
districts
because
new
york
city
gets
the
statutory
rate.
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
suburban
counties
which
will
previously
lump
in
with
new
york
city.
now,
get
him
out
slightly
lower
than
new
york
city
and
the
two
other
upstate
districts
are
administratively
established
that
is
slightly
lower
rate
than
the
suburban
counties
ringing
new
york
city
and
also
couple
of
upstate
counties
which
were
traditionally
thrown
in
with
these
suburban
counties.
so
that
now
in
effect
they
were
four
rates
subject
only
to
the
injunctions
which
have
thrown
the
suburban
counties
in
with
new
york
city.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
precisely
the
question
mr.
chief
justice,
on
whether
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
sir.
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
still
a
question
of
whether
there's
any
rational
basis
for
the
differential
and
as
we
shall
show
there's
a
more
than
adequate
basis
for
that
differential
for
the
reasons
which
were
reduced
before
the
three-judge
court
in
which
i'd
like
to
expound
on
here.
it
should
be
noted
before
we
turn
to
that
that
these
payments
don't
include
rent
or
fuel
for
heating
and
the
record
shows
that
the
actual
payments
received
by
welfare
recipients
in
new
york
city
for
rent
which
have
paid
over
and
above
these
statutory
or
administratively
set
allowances
are
considerably
higher
in
the
suburban
counties
than
they
are
in
new
york
city.
indeed
as
the
record
show
here,
a
--
the
average
rent
received
by
welfare
family
of
four
in
new
york
city
is
$84.00
a
month.
the
plaintiffs
here
who
are
single
women
just
one
person,
are
getting
a
$105.00
and
$108.00
a
month,
if
my
memory
serves
over
a
hundred
many
event
and
in
nassau
county,
the
record
indicates
that
the
maximum
permissible
payment
for
family
of
four
is
a
$155.00
or
a
$160.00
a
month
depending
on
whether
it
is
an
apartment
or
a
private
house.
but
that
almost
double
the
average
that's
received
in
new
york
city.
this
is
due
to
rent
control
and
i
suppose
to
the
larger
amount
of
apartments
available
in
new
york
city
and
the
general
squeeze
and
housing
in
the
suburban
counties
which
have
grown
so
rapidly
over
the
past
years.
but
in
any
event,
whatever
the
reasons
when
discussing
the
actual
benefits
or
allowances
received
by
welfare
recipient
of
which
shelter
is
obviously
one
of
the
basic
components.
you've
got
to
look
not
only
at
the
welfare
allowance
which
doesn't
include
shelter
but
also
at
the
cost
of
shelter
which
is
also
paid
by
the
commissioner.
and
since
the
cost
of
rental
are
so
much
less
in
new
york
city
and
averages
also
that
in
fact
these
plaintiffs
and
other
similarly
situated
in
nassau
and
westchester
counties
are
actually
receiving
as
much
money
or
perhaps
more
as
people
in
new
york
city.
unfortunately,
the
record
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
i'm
lumping
that
in
with
shelter
fuel
for
heating
is
paid
separately
but
in
many
cases
there's
no
separate
item
for
that.
for
example,
typically
a
welfare
recipient
lives
in
an
apartment
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
--
where
there
is
central
heating
in
so
that
it
wouldn't
come
up
or
even
if
a
welfare
recipient
rented
a
house
they
might
well
or
an
apartment
in
a
house
or
something
that
they
might
will
be
central
heating
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
not
necessarily.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
but
the
heat
is
a
--
it's
he
minimum
item,
it
doesn't
exist
in
most
cases.
in
any
event,
while
we
unfortunately
don't
have
in
the
record
full
statistics
on
the
total
aggregate
amount
of
rental
money
and
fuel
for
heating
paid
in
new
york
city
vis-à-vis
what's
paid
in
the
suburban
counties?
the
record
does
indicate
that
the
average
rental
for
welfare
recipients
in
new
york
city
is
so
much
lower
than
these
plaintiffs
in
particular
received
or
that
the
maximum
permitted
in
nassau
county
and
westchester
is
that
the
record
indicates
plainly
that
fall
from
being
discriminated
against
are
receiving
less
money
when
shelter
is
considered
as
a
certainly
it
should
be.
they're
coming
out
just
as
well
as
a
person
in
new
york
city.
but
over
above
that
the
claim
here
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
also
of
the
social
security
act
and
regulations
there
under.
and
the
court
below,
we
submit
improperly
and
certainly
improperly
in
the
light
of
this
court's
opinion
in
dandridge
bypass
completely
the
social
security
act
and
regulation
claim
and
instead
of
veering
away
from
the
constitutional
issue
as
courts
are
suppose
to.
it
in
effect
veered
toward
it
and
went
out
of
its
way
to
determine
the
constitutional
question
adversely
to
the
state
as
it
happens
and
we
submit
that
reversal
as
required
on
that
ground
alone
over
above
everything
else.
but
this
statute
has
to
be
viewed
whether
we
talked
of
equal
protection
or
the
statute
in
regulation
in
the
context
of
a
statutory
scheme
in
new
york
state
which
traditionally
treats
new
york
city
as
sui
generis
and
indeed
new
york
city
is
a
special
case.
it's
--
it's
the
urban
megalopolis
par
excellence.
it
comprises
half
the
people
in
new
york
state
and
indeed,
more
than
half
of
the
welfare
recipients
about
three-quarters
as
the
record
states
and
the
--
throughout
the
statutes
in
new
york,
we
see
special
treatment
given
new
york
city
far
and
excess
i'm
sure
of
this
special
treatment
given
chicago
or
baltimore
or
philadelphia
in
the
statutes
of
those
states.
indeed,
this
court
itself
in
salzburg
against
maryland
remarked
quoting
an
earlier
case
missouri
against
lewis,
a
19th
century
case
that
it
would
be
permissible
under
the
equal
protection
clause
for
new
york
state
to
apply
the
civil
code,
the
civil
law
in
the
new
york
city
in
common
law
of
the
rest
of
the
state
if
it
wanted
to.
now,
that's
sounds
like
hyperbole
but
this
court
said
it
and
it
quoted
it
salzburg
against
maryland
which
is
a
case
from
the
1950's.
the
fact
is
that
new
york
city
is
different,
it
is
unique,
and
the
legislature
has
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of
that.
the
--
our
brief
and
balance
specific
examples,
for
example
the
multiple
dwelling
law
which
prescribes
all
kinds
of
requirements
for
apartment
houses,
only
applies
to
new
york
city.
there's
a
multiple
residence
law
which
is
entirely
different
which
applies
to
the
apartment
houses
outside
new
york
city.
as
this
court
knows
well
from
the
baldwin
case
which
is
before
it,
the
entire
structure
of
the
penal
law
is
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
is
different
in
new
york
city
and
indeed
this
court
has
before
it
the
question
of
whether
new
york
state
can
permissibly
within
the
equal
protection
clause
give
jury
trials
for
misdemeanors
outside
the
city
and
not
give
them
in
new
york
city.
now,
whatever
the
rights
and
wrongs
are
there.
it's
again
illustrative
of
the
fact
that
the
new
york
legislature
has
traditionally
treated
new
york
city
as
a
very,
very
different
thing
from
the
rest
of
the
state.
now,
when
we
look
at
section
131-a,
we
don't
see
the
enormous
difference
that
we
find
in
these
areas
where
you
talking
about
giving
jury
trials
in
one
place
and
not
somewhere
else
or
having
stringent
requirements
on
multiple
dwellings
in
new
york
city
and
not
having
them
in
the
other
counties
of
the
state.
we're
talking
here
about
a
very
slight
$5.00
a
person
differential
which
the
legislature
which
as
i've
said
it
has
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of
the
specific
local
conditions,
so
fit
to
provide
as
a
benefit
to
compensate
for
the
higher
social
cause
of
urban
living
which
the
new
york
city
welfare
recipient
has
to
endure.
the
question
here
is
this
court
said
is
whether
the
grounds
adopted
by
the
legislature
are
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
states
objective
and
the
--
unless
the
court
can
say
that
they
are
also
wholly
irrelevant
then
it
plainly
has
to
reverse
it
appears.
now
lets
look
at
the
grounds,
these
grounds
are
specific
and
factual.
they're
not
policy
grounds
and
yet
in
dandridge,
this
court
so
fit
to
declare
that
the
maximum
family
rule
in
maryland
which
created
a
real
difference,
a
sizeable
difference
in
the
amount
of
welfare
benefits
received
by
individuals
depending
on
whether
or
not
they
were
in
a
large
family.
it
held
that
that
was
a
permissible
exercise
of
maryland's
legislative
discretion
based
solely
on
maryland's
policy
grounds.
now
here
we
don't
have
policy,
we
have
actual
--
factual
material.
for
example,
we
have
the
rent
control
and
the
actual
lower
rents
within
the
new
york
city
which
i've
already
alluded
to.
in
addition
as
the
record
shows
and
the
studies
on
housing
within
new
york
city
show
because
of
rent
control
and
because
of
the
antiquity
of
much
of
the
housing
in
areas
where
welfare
recipients
have
large
to
live,
there's
been
an
enormous
deterioration
in
the
quality
of
that
housing
and
realistically,
the
legislature
was
entitled
to
find
that
this
entails
the
purchase
of
items
necessary
to
maintain
this
deteriorated
housing
which
might
not
exist
in
suburban
area.
in
addition,
you
have
the
crime
rate
within
new
york
city.
now,
the
statistics
again
within
the
record
and
set
forth
in
our
brief
show
that
the
amount
of
crimes
and
the
amount
of
violent
crimes
specifically
are
far
higher
within
new
york
city
per
capita.
and
once
again,
the
legislature
has
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of
these
factors
and
it
has
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
that
the
higher
crime
rate
which
unfortunately
strikes
people
the
hardest
who
live
in
the
areas,
getaway
areas,
and
low
income
neighborhoods
were
welfare
recipients
for
the
most
part
of
obliged
to
reside.
this
necessitates
taken
a
taxicab
home
at
night.
it
necessitates
buying
lots,
replacing
stolen
goods,
replacing
stolen
monies,
replacing
stolen
welfare
checks.
it's
true
that
new
york
city
does
permit
stolen
welfare
checks
to
be
replaced
if
they're
reported
but
certainly
not
every
stolen
welfare
check
is
reported
and
stolen
goods
and
monies
undoubtedly
are
not
reported
in
the
majority
of
cases.
window
gates
and
bars
and
other
devices
that
are
necessitates
by
a
high
crime
rate
are
simply
effective
life
for
new
york
city
slum
dweller.
and
its
no
doubt
debatable
whether
the
legislature
should
give
more
money
within
its
standard
of
need
to
compensate
the
new
york
city
welfare
recipient
for
these
problems.
but
once
we
concede
that
its
debatable
then
the
equal
protection
clause
doesn't
apply
and
its
simply
becomes
a
matter
of
what
the
three-judge
court
below
did
in
our
judgment
namely
substituting
its
views
on
policy
for
the
legislature's
discretion
in
coping
with
the
realistic
problem
before
it.
what
this
court
characterized
in
dandridge
as
the,
i'm
paraphrasing
the
court,
but
the
extraordinarily
difficult
problem
of
apportioning
or
puzzling
out
to
welfare
recipients
all
of
whom
obviously
need
whatever
the
state
can
afford
to
give
him.
precisely
how
much
this
state
can
give
this
one
and
that
one
and
here
we
repeat
the
differential
was
extremely
slight
compared
to
the
family
maximum
which
this
court
sustained
in
dandridge.
another
fact
which
the
legislature
--
since
it
enacted
this
factor
had
to
be
aware
of
with
the
sales
tax
and
new
york
city
has
a
6%
sales
tax,
3%
state,
and
additional
3%
imposed
by
the
city.
in
nassau,
the
3%
state
sales
tax
applies
to
statewide
of
course
but
in
nassau
county,
the
county
tax
is
only
2%.
in
westchester
county
except
for
one
city,
the
city
of
yonkers,
there's
no
county
tax
at
all.
these
means
and
if
--
in
the
other
suburban
counties,
there's
no
county
tax
or
city
tax
at
all.
these
means
that
on
items
other
than
food
which
welfare
recipient
has
to
buy
clothing,
household
appliances,
and
the
like
to
the
extent
that
this
additional
3%
vis-à-vis
westchester
county
resident
or
1%
vis-à-vis
nassau
county
residents
sales
tax
applies
that
in
it
of
itself
makes
a
difference.
i
refer
the
court
in
our
brief
to
the
fact
that
the
internal
revenue
service
in
its
tax
forms
for
the
year
1969.
so
fit
to
recognize
that
for
a
family
with
an
income
between
$3,000.00
and
$4,000.00
a
year
which
is
the
income
of
family
of
four
on
welfare
in
new
york.
the
sales
tax
allowable
under
the
suggested
permissible
allowances
for
a
sales
tax
deduction
on
income
tax
is
$92.00
for
new
york
city
for
that
family
of
four
at
that
income
level
and
only
$46.00
in
westchester
county.
now,
right
there
you've
got
a
$4.00
a
month
differential.
now,
we
are
not
suggesting
that
this
is
necessarily
binding
on
a
legislature
or
that
they
have
to
abide
by
that.
but
once
we
can
see
that
it
is
debatable
point
then
we've
left
the
equal
protection
clause
far
behind
and
we're
in
the
area
of
legislative
discretion.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
sir.
because
we
have
the
statute
in
regulation
we
chose
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
but
we
do
have
that
and
i
would
like
to
get
to
that.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
certainly
will.
it's
--
it's
interesting
to
learn
of
an
administrative
policy
when
you
pick
up
a
brief
that's
filed
in
this
could.
we
--
weren't
aware
of
this
administrative
policy.
the
letter
sent
by
the
regional
commissioner
of
hew,
mr.
collison
to
commissioner
wyman
back
in
november
said
that
while
there
was
a
differential
and
they
questioned
that
differential.
they
said
that
to
the
extent
that
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
courts
were
different
between
new
york
city
and
the
other
counties,
that
differential
would
be
alright.
now,
commissioner
wyman
didn't
reply
of
the
letter
of
regional
commissioner
because
the
pendency
of
this
lawsuit.
the
commissioner
invited,
commissioner
wyman,
to
indicate
what
the
factual
basis
where
for
the
slight
differential
in
favor
of
new
york
city
welfare
recipients.
and
as
i've
said
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
litigation,
commissioner
wyman
didn't
reply
and
that's
where
the
matter
lay
until
last
week
when
i
got
the
government's
brief
and
i
was
interested
to
learn
that
they
have
a
consistent
administrative
policy
in
this
area.
this
was
fascinating
because
not
only
has
new
york
city
paid
a
different
amount
over
the
years
long
before
the
adoption
of
this
section.
they
had
as
we've
been
indicated
three
separate
areas
within
the
state.
but
as
i
learned
in
the
dandridge
case
the
city
of
baltimore
pays
$10.00
a
month
more
than
the
rest
of
maryland.
i
should
say
the
state
of
maryland
pays
people
in
baltimore
$10.00
a
month
more
and
as
we
discovered
in
our
research
and
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
state
of
california
has
a
whole
crazy
quilt
of
amounts
paid
it
varies
with
the
contribution
of
the
county
wants
to
make
and
their
enormous
differences.
and
of
course,
once
we
look
beyond
state
boarders
and
we
start
looking
to
what
happens
between
one
state
another
state.
then
the
difference
has
become
enormous
and
without
even
discussing
the
differences
in
wealth
they
are
paid
between
the
states
like
new
york
and
the
southern
states,
right
on
the
northeastern
states
where
the
standard
of
living
is
about
the
same
on
the
states
that
you
pass
through
taking
the
train
from
new
york
to
washington.
you'll
see
that
the
level
of
payments
in
wilmington,
delaware
with
the
standard
of
living
can't
be
very
different
from
new
york
city
or
philadelphia.
the
welfare
payment
is
about
half
what
it
is
in
new
york
city
and
philadelphia
it's
a
lot
lower
than
this
in
new
york
city.
so,
since
the
federal
government
and
specifically
the
department
of
health
education
and
welfare
is
the
agency
that's
suppose
to
administer
all
these
and
try
to
make
assemblance
of
order.
it
appears
to
us
that
the
straining
at
gnats
when
they
get
all
excited
about
$5.00
a
month
between
new
york
city
and
the
suburbs
around
it
and
they're
perfectly
willing
to
let
all
the
rest
to
just
go
by.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
hew,
mr.
justice
black,
resisted
the
urged
to
talk
about
equal
protection
and
they
confined
themselves
to
the
statute
and
the
regulation.
although,
they
said
quite
astonishingly
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
regulation
went
further
than
the
equal
protection
clause
and
that
struck
me
as
odd
and
i
think
it
will
strike
anyone
as
odd
who
looks
at
it.
the
regulation
simply
says
there
has
to
be
a
statewide
standard
of
need
which
new
york
concededly
has
that's
admitted
by
hew.
mr.
philip
weinberg
mr.
justice
black,
they
appear
to
be
saying
that
the
use
of
the
words
objective
and
equitable
in
their
regulation
require
the
state
to
pay
the
precise
mathematical
same
figure
in
every
part
of
the
state.
unless
they
can
come
forward
and
show
that
there's
a
demonstrable
difference.
now,
we
maintain
that
we're
doing
that.
we're
showing
that
there's
a
demonstrable
difference
but
the
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
that's
precisely
why
i
say
they
are
straining
it
gnats
here.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
i
can't
speak
for
them
mr.
justice
black.
they
don't
--
they
don't
say
anything
about
that
in
their
brief.
all
they
say
is
that
they
want
new
york
state
to
pay
the
precise
same
dollar
amount
throughout
the
state.
otherwise,
they
are
violating
the
regulation
which
talks
about
an
objective
and
equitable
standard
but
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
unless
the
--
unless
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
there
is
an
objective
difference
even
that
which
there
own
regional
commissioner
collison
said,
they
appear
to
be
backing
away
from
because
when
you
read
their
brief
they
seem
to
require
a
--
a
mathematical
precision
and
the
payment
throughout
the
state.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
there
is
a
statewide
standard
of
need
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
--
that
the
dollar
amount
paid
throughout
the
state
has
to
be
identical.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
regional
--
the
regional
commissioner
conceded
in
this
letter
of
november
10,
1969
which
is
appended
to
their
brief
and
it's
in
the
appendix
and
it's
appended
to
the
plaintiff's
brief
as
well.
they
said
in
there
that
if
there's
a
demonstrable
difference
then
we're
not
violating
that
regulation
or
that
statute.
and
throughout
the
years
we
had
three
different
standards
varying
between
new
york
city
and
the
suburban
counties
which
used
to
be
lumped
together
until
1969,
then
a
batch
up
of
counties
and
then
another
group
of
upstate
counties.
now,
probably
that
was
alright
with
hew.
maryland
giving
people
in
baltimore
$10.00
a
month
is
alright
with
hew.
the
variation
as
between
the
states
which
have
paid
for
half
by
federal
money
alright
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
the
regional
commissioner
didn't
insist
it.
as
i
read
their
brief
i'm
a
little
unclear
as
to
whether
they're
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
oh,
i'd
like
to
read
the
brief
that
way
mr.
justice
white
and
if
we
can
read
it
that
way.
then,
i
think
with
all
due
respect
the
new
york
is
home
free
because
we've
shown
that
there
is
that
demonstrable
standard.
at
least
it's
debatable
and
once
it's
debatable
that
regulation
certainly
can
impose
any
greater
requirements
on
new
york
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
uses
words
like
objective
and
equitable
and
that
can
mean
anything
more
than
equal
protection
clause
means.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that
appears
to
be
what
they're
saying.
but
when
you
look
at
the
reasons
for
the
slight
differential
in
favor
of
new
york
city,
we
see
that
the
legislature
in
fact
have
valid
reasons.
it
had
the
deterioration
of
housing,
the
higher
crime
rate,
the
higher
sales
tax,
and
one
which
was
testified
to
by
the
commissioner
which
i
didn't
get
to
yet.
and
namely
the
fact
that
the
best
bulk,
the
overwhelming
preponderance
of
welfare
monies
are
paid
under
the
afdc
program.
and
that
means
that
most
welfare
recipients
in
new
york
as
in
other
states
are
children
and
the
--
where
the
social
cost
of
urban
living
hits
home
is
to
the
child
on
afdc
living
typically
in
new
york
city.
unfortunately,
in
a
tenement
of
and
in
areas
remote
from
a
park
as
our
brief
indicates
there
are
huge
areas
in
bronx
county
particularly
which
has
a
high
number
of
welfare
recipients
where
there
simply
no
folk
around
from
miles.
this
necessitates
the
parent
taking
the
child
on
public
transportation
and
bringing
him
to
a
park
or
to
the
zoos
in
museums
and
aquariums
and
other
facilities,
beaches
which
are
available
to
the
--
in
new
york
city,
and
which
a
part
of
urban
living.
now
in
the
suburbs,
we're
not
about
to
suggest
that
life
in
the
suburbs
where
an
afdc
child
is
rosy
but
there's
more
room
around
and
the
legislature
had
a
right
to
find
that
a
child
on
welfare
in
nassau
or
westchester
county
is
a
lot
more
right
to
have
some
kind
of
a
vacant
lot
around
than
a
child
in
tenement
and
hold
them
with
the
self
bronx.
and
for
this
--
and
also
the
zoos
and
beaches
and
so
on
which
existed
in
new
york
city
are
simply
inaccessible
in
nassau
county.
so,
this
is
another
item
which
the
legislature
and
its
discretion
had
a
right
to
consider.
we're
not
saying
that
that
every
member
of
this
court
are
indeed
any
member
of
this
court
has
to
necessarily
agree
with
what
the
legislature
said
in
everyone
of
these
instances
or
any
of
these
instances.
but
there
has
to
be
an
ambit
or
scope
of
legislative
discretion
and
these
are
factual
things
here.
they're
not
--
they're
not
policy
things
such
as
maryland
advanced
successfully
in
the
dandridge
case.
these
are
factual
things
which
the
legislature
and
the
commissioner
who
has
the
expertise
and
the
core
of
civil
service
people
or
staff
who
would
administers
this
program
have
to
be
presumed
to
be
aware
of.
now,
the
commissioner
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
oh,
i
think
they
meld
or
dovetail,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
standard
the
regulation
is
objective
and
equitable,
and
when
one
reads
that
together
with
the
statute
which
speaks
of
the
statewide
standard
of
need.
i
think
we're
--
we're
roughly
in
the
same
territories
the
equal
protection
clause
which
says
that
there
has
to
be
rational
standard
for
the
legislature.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
sir.
i
agreed
but
we
think
that
the
where
the
legislature
has
the
demonstrable
standard.
the
very
language
that
the
regional
commissioner
of
hew
talked
about
that
they're
both
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
both
under
the
test
on
the
under
regulation
of
objective
and
equitable.
this
--
their
existence
adequate
ground
from
the
differential,
but
we
note
that
the
three-judge
court
didn't
look
at
that
way
at
all.
they
bypassed
the
statutory
and
regulatory
ground
and
they
--
as
we've
indicated
they
veered
toward
the
constitutional
ground.
it's
that
right
off
the
back,
it
would
appear
that
the
sweeping
injunctions
granted
below
have
to
be
reversed.
but
we
submit
that
a
remand
for
the
purpose
of
considering
the
statutory
and
regulatory
ground
wouldn't
served
any
useful
purpose
here
because
the
scope
or
the
ambit
of
discretion
within
which
the
state
legislature
was
allowed
under
that
test
seems
to
be
about
the
same
as
the
government
in
effect
says
in
its
brief
as
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
indeed
as
their
commissioner
said
that
to
the
extent
they
are
demonstrable
differences
the
differential
will
be
justified
as
indeed
they've
justified
differentials
in
new
york,
maryland,
and
california,
and
for
awhile
in
other
states
over
the
years.
mr.
philip
weinberg
they
appear
--
they
appear
sir
to
be
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
they
appear
to
be
saying
sir
that
there
were
no
objective
standards
under
which
the
legislature
pays
a
differential
to
people
in
new
york
city
who
are
in
welfare.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
they're
suggesting
that
it's
discriminatory
or
that
it's
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
--
it's
invidious.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
honor
that
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
statute
which
says
that
there
has
to
be
statewide
standard
of
need
and
the
hew
regulation
which
says
that
the
standard
of
need
and
the
amounts
paid
have
to
be
objective
equitable
throughout
the
state.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
think
they're
saying
that
to
the
extent
that
we
can
demonstrate
that
there's
a
valid
reason
to
pay
people
in
new
york
city
more
then
we
don't
violate
the
statute
or
the
regulation,
to
the
extent
that
we
can't
show
such
a
valid
reason
and
we
do
violate
the
statute
in
there
regulation.
but
the
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
exactly,
sir.
and
over
and
above
that,
we
point
out
that
the
injunctions
granted
below
were
not
granted
on
the
statutory
ground
with
the
three-judge
court
so
fit
to
ignore.
they
were
granted
on
the
constitutional
ground
and
the
way
they
phrase
their
border
than
what
this
court
permits
and
permitted
under
the
rosado
case
for
example,
in
issuing
an
injunction
where
the
only
ground
statutory
and
not
constitutional.
the
most
this
court
did
in
rosado
where
there
was
a
violation
found
of
a
--
of
an
act
of
congress
was
to
remand
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
to
give
new
york
state
the
choice
of
letting
federal
funds
go
or
of
redrafting
the
statute.
and
we
submit
that
the
three-judge
court
below
didn't
do
anything
like
that
for
the
good
reason
or
at
least
for
the
reason
that
they
didn't
take
the
statutory
route.
they
took
the
constitutional
route
and
for
this
reason,
i
think
this
court
can
pass
on
both
the
constitutional
ground
and
the
statutory
ground
and
find
that
--
as
this
court
said
in
dandridge
that
there
isn't
anything
special
about
welfare
statutes
which
requires
a
more
rigorous
constitutional
standards
to
be
employed
as
in
cases
involving
racial
discrimination
or
the
right
to
vote
or
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech.
the
dandridge
certainly
laid
that
argument
to
rest
and
that's
the
keystone
of
the
whole
argument
adopted
by
the
three-judge
court
and
i
think
once
we
remove
that
keystone,
there's
not
much
left
to
support
those
injunctions.
the
statute
and
regulation,
i
never
even
consider
so
at
the
very
least
of
remand
is
required
but
we
go
further
than
that
and
we
say
that
the
complaint
should
be
simply
dismissed.
and
that
summary
judgment
should
be
granted
and
in
our
favor
because
the
requisite
demonstrable
differences
have
been
shown
to
exist.
and
whether
we're
talking
about
equal
protection
or
the
statute
or
the
regulation,
new
york
state
has
demonstrated
that
it
had
a
demonstrable
reason
a
rational
basis
for
the
determination
that
legislature
made.
and
it
--
and
i
should
add
the
determination
that
the
commissioner
made
in
which
he
reduced
the
size
of
the
disparity
to
approximately
half.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
we
are.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that's
correct
of
course.
but
we
submit
that
the
facts
are
basically
before
this
court
and
this
isn't
the
kind
of
disputed
issue
effect
which
lends
itself
to
a
trial.
although,
if
the
court
orders
a
trial
we'll
have
one
i
suppose
if
the
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
there
was
a
deposition
of
the
commissioner.
there
was
an
affidavit
of
a
one
of
the
men
on
his
staff
and
the
rest
of
facts
which
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
of
such
as
the
existence
of
rent
control,
the
higher
crime
rate,
the
sales
tax
and
things
of
that
nature.
the
once
that
the
court
can't
take
judicial
notice
of
such
as
the
higher
cost
of
living
to
the
trial
on
afdc
in
the
city
or
testified
to
by
commissioner
wyman
and
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
of
mr.
murphy,
a
member
of
commissioner
wyman's
staff.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
it
added
--
it
said
that
mr.
justice
black
and
i
added
the
words,
and
i'm
paraphrasing
it,
unless
objective
criteria
can
be
demonstrated
or
something
like
that
but
nevertheless
the
injunctions
in
effect.
and
while
the
injunction
was
issued
by
the
three-judge
court
on
a
finding
that
these
plaintiffs
weren't
people
on
afdc
and
therefore,
our
whole
argument
about
children
on
afdc
didn't
apply
to
this
disabled
ladies
who
presumably
don't
want
to
go
to
the
park
or
the
zoo
and
so
on.
they
nonetheless
permitted
intervention
by
people
on
afdc.
so
that
now
the
injunction
applies
to
everyone
on
welfare
within
those
states.
mr.
philip
weinberg
it
orders
new
york
to
pay
the
same
amount
of
money
to
people
in
the
suburban
counties
as
to
those
in
new
york
city
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no.
in
the
suburban
counties
around
new
york
city,
nassau,
westchester
and
the
six
other
counties
which
the
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
it
names
the
counties.
unless
we
can
show
that
objective
criteria
exists
other
than
in
a
court
in
accordance
of
objective
criteria.
so
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
if
we
have
the
opportunity.
we'll
try
to
mr.
chief
justice,
but
we
think
that
we've
shown
enough
here
to
set
aside
the
preliminary
injunctions
and
to
grant
summary
judgment
in
our
favor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may
in
hopes
that
we
won't
impose
on
the
court
for
tomorrow.
mr.
philip
weinberg
they
showed
that
the
actual
cost
of
living
of
individual
items,
the
loaf
of
the
bread
and
the
bottle
of
milk
were
and
i
suppose
a
pair
of
trousers
and
so
on
that
people
have
to
buy
were
the
same
in
new
york
city
as
they
are
in
nassau
county.
and
that's
not
in
dispute,
they
are.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we
combat
that
sir
by
suggesting
that
that's
not
the
only
thing
that
a
welfare
department
has
to
concern
itself
with
in
paying
these
allowances.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
rent
is
separate
as
we've
been
indicated.
rent
is
higher
in
the
suburban
counties
because
of
rent
control.
and
because
there's
more
housing
available
in
new
york
city
so
that
rent
is
entirely
different
but
of
the
factors
outside
of
shelter.
the
essence
of
their
proof
is
that
the
bread
and
milk
and
so
on,
and
clothing
specific
items
the
toaster
cost
the
same
in
the
new
york
city
as
they
do
in
nassau
county.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
that
but
we
don't
think
that
resolves
the
case.
we
certainly
don't
think
that
that
in
of
itself
demonstrates
that
the
legislature
was
so
irrational
and
seemed
fit
to
give
these
people,
the
new
york
city,
$5.00
a
month
a
person
more.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
don't
think
a
fact
--
a
group
of
elements
like
that
lends
itself
a
whole
a
configuration
of
factors
lends
itself
to
precise
computation.
i
don't
think
this
is
like
a
--
let
say
a
negligence
case
or
a
case
where
you
have
to
appraise
the
value
of
a
piece
of
property.
the
legislature
has
a
right
in
its
discretion
to
consider
a
lot
of
factors.
some
of
which
aren't
very
tangible
and
some
of
which
are
very
difficult
to
put
a
dollar
and
cent
sign
on.
mr.
philip
weinberg
a
court
would
be
the
proper
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
--
a
court
would
be
the
proper
forum
if
we
transgress
the
equal
protection
clause.
for
example,
that
we
pay
people
of
one
race
more
than
people
of
another
race,
or
we
did
something
that
was
so
totally
out
of
line
that
there
was
just
no
way
to
justify
it.
like
paying
people
in
new
york
city
three
times
what
we
paid
people
on
long
island.
but
so
long
as
we're
in
the
area
of
a
slight
differential
and
so
long
as
we've
come
forward
with
cogent
reasons
for
what
we
did.
we
say
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
satisfied
and
the
standard
set
forth
in
the
regulations
satisfied.
and
consequently,
the
injunction
should
be
set
aside
and
this
complaint
should
be
dismissed.
i
haven't
touch
on
the
unripeness
of
this
case.
it's
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
i'll
refer
to
it
on
my
rebuttal
time
defending,
if
i
may?
thank
you
very
much
for
the
opportunity.
mr.
philip
weinberg
thank
you
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
short
answer
to
mr.
strauss’
argument
about
albeit
the
district
court
started
of
on
the
wrong
foot,
why
don’t
we
simply
take
it
the
other
way
and
affirm
the
injunction
anyway
because
they’re
probably
right
about
the
statutory
ground
as
well.
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
the
sweeping
injunctions
that
were
granted
below
aren’t
supported
by
the
statutory
ground.
and
this
court’s
decision
in
rosado
makes
that
clear
because
what
the
court
did
below
was
issue
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
statute
at
all
unless
it
were
corrected
and
objectives
--
what
they
thought
were
objective
standards
were
imposed,
which
would
have
been
a
valid
injunction
under
the
equal
protection
clause
assuming
a
violation
of
that
clause
had
been
shown.
the
language
is,
other
--
they’re
enjoined
from
enforcing
this
statute
at
all
other
than
according
to
objective,
non-discriminatory
standards
based
upon
the
cost
of
the
needs
of
such
recipients.
now,
a
statutory
nonconformity
as
in
rosado
doesn’t
support
any
such
injunction,
and
indeed
this
court,
rosado
made
that
clear.
the
most
that
could
be
done
there
would
be
a
remand
to
the
district
court
to
what
--
assuming
that
the
probabilities
were
that
the
hew
is
right
and
we
were
wrong
about
the
statutory
argument,
the
most
that
could
be
done
would
be
to
remand
the
case
of
district
court
for
a
much
more
narrow
injunction
such
as
the
one
this
court
discussed
in
rosado.
now,
over
and
above
that
when
we
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
precisely.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
they
started
off
on
the
wrong
foot.
they
aimed
toward
the
constitutional
ground
and
they
did
just
what
this
court
in
dandridge
said
they
shouldn’t
do
and
what
we
cited
earlier
cases
suggesting
that
they
not
do,
namely
they
decided
the
constitutional
issue
and
let
the
statutory
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
mr.
justice
white,
the
--
this
court
in
rosado
indicated
that
in
a
nonconformity
situation
which
is
what
that
would
be,
the
most
that
could
be
fashioned
would
be
an
injunction
against
that
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
against
the
nonconformity
or
against
the
receipt
of
the
federal
funds
by
the
state
of
new
york.
indeed
in
rosado,
the
plaintiffs
wanted
all
along
that
the
statute
be
enjoined
for
nonconformity
and
that
although
the
court
agreed
with
them
on
the
merits,
the
court
didn’t
grant
such
an
injunction.
and
in
rosado
it
specifically
sent
the
case
back
to
district
court
in
brooklyn
to
fashion
--
to
see
what
the
state
would
in
1970
first
of
all,
which
is
not
applicable
here
but
the
point
is
that
even
if
the
state
remained
in
the
nonconformity,
this
court’s
opinion
in
rosado
seem
to
make
it
clear
that
the
most
could
be
an
injunction
against
the
receipt
of
federal
funds,
if
we
remained
in
nonconformity.
mr.
philip
weinberg
precisely.
mr.
philip
weinberg
unless
the
state
board
itself
into
conformity
assuming
the
court
ruled
that
it
was
out
of
conformity
but
that’s
a
far
different
sort
of
injunction
from
the
injunctions
that
were
granted
below.
mr.
philip
weinberg
not
to
my
knowledge.
of
course,
every
change
that’s
ever
made
or
any
claim
or
standard
of
need
has
to
conform
to
federal
law
and
there
you
have
to
be
submitted
to
hew.
mr.
philip
weinberg
to
my
knowledge,
no.
mr.
philip
weinberg
again
to
my
knowledge,
no.
as
i’ve
said
they’ve
--
as
i
indicated
yesterday
they
permitted
the
maryland
and
california
disparities
which
mr.
strauss
just
discussed
to
continue
over
the
years.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
indeed
and
they
can
compel
that.
when
we
look
at
the
standard
of
need,
we
see
that
in
fact
new
york
has
one
standard
of
need
and
it’s
the
same
throughout
the
state
just
as
the
federal
statute
says
it
must
be.
this
isn't
a
case
where
we
have
one
standard
of
need
for
the
city
and
one
for
outside
the
city,
although
the
government
tries
to
paint
it
that
way.
it’s
simply
isn’t
so.
the
standard
of
need
isn't
in
statutory
in
new
york
--
it’s
administrative.
it’s
prepared
by
commissioner
wieman,
by
the
department
of
social
services
and
it
lists
the
various
components
of
that
standard
of
needs;
food,
household
appliances,
shelter,
although
rent
is
paid
separately,
clothing,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
but
it
would
be
simply
contrary
to
reality
to
expect
that
every
welfare
recipients
or
indeed
any
welfare
recipient
adhere
so
precisely
to
that
standard
of
need
which
tells
them
how
many
razorblades
he
has
to
buy
in
the
course
of
the
year
and
how
many
newspaper,
and
so
on,
obviously,
there’s
a
great
deal
of
flexibility
in
the
standard
of
need.
the
state
arise
that
it
figured
that
they
consider
to
be
an
approximation
of
what
the
social
realities
are,
and
then
they
give
that
money
to
a
welfare
recipient
and
he’s
presumed
to
purchase
with
that
money
what
he
has
to
buy.
nobody
is
there
to
make
sure
that
he
buys
a
newspaper
everyday
or
a
razorblade
three
times
a
week
or
whatever
the
standard
of
need
happens
to
work
out.
that’s
an
administrative
averaging
process,
and
if
the
standard
of
need
in
new
york
city
doesn’t
list
buying
the
lock
for
door,
or
a
window
guard,
if
a
persons
lives
in
a
bad
neighborhood,
or
if
he
doesn’t
say
anything
about
taxi
cabs,
well
the
fact
that
there’s
a
higher
sales
tax
in
new
york
city,
it’s
simply
flies
in
the
face
of
reality
to
expect
that
welfare
recipients
aren’t
going
to
nevertheless
buy
locks
if
they
need
locks.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
know
that
very
justice
marshall.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
they
do
but
the
legislature
was
entitled
to
find
that
statistically
comparing
new
york
city
with
its
enormously
high
crime
rate
and
narcotic
addiction
and
all
the
rest
with
the
rest
of
the
state
taken
as
a
whole
and
they
saw
fit
to
draw
the
line
at
that
particular
point,
that
problem
was
greater
in
new
york.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
they
could
have
drawn
the
line
to
say
cities
over
a
hundred
thousand
people.
well,
they
could
have
drawn
westchester
in
with
new
york,
but
they
didn’t.
it's
a
--
again
we’re
in
the
area
which
where
a
legislature
has
to
have
some
discretion
or
it
doesn't
have
any
discretion
at
all.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
the
legislature
saw
fit
to
do
so.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
they
did.
now
crime
isn’t
the
only
component
of
that.
for
example,
the
utility
rate
is
lower
in
the
western
of
state
than
it
is
in
new
york.
mr.
philip
weinberg
utilities,
no.
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
utilities
are
the
same
in
the
new
york
area.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
evidence
in
the
record
indicates
that
it
is
but
the
legislature
found
that
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
legislature
found
that
the
new
york
city
child
on
afdc
has
a
greater
need
to
avail
himself
and
his
parents
also
to
avail
themselves
of
the
municipal
transportation
system
in
taking
their
child
to
a
park
or
a
zoo
which
in
new
york
city
to
a
ghetto
resident
is
up
to
not
be
near
where
he
lives.
mr.
philip
weinberg
now
that
might
well
also
be
true
in
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well
they
might
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
question
about
it
mr.
justice
marshall
but
this
is
a
legislative
determination
based
on
discretion
and
some
of
these
things
are
simply
factual,
such
as
the
sales
tax
about
which
there
is
little
dispute.
and
others
are
perhaps
more
debatable
but
as
long
as
reasonable
people
can
differ
about
them
then
i
don’t
see
how
were
--
how
the
legislature
can
be
held
to
have
transgressed
the
equal
protection
clause
or
not
have
a
statewide
standard
of
need,
the
fashion
and
after
objective
and
equitable
standards
which
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we
maintain
this
as
we
have
throughout
that
the
district
court
improperly
went
to
the
equal
protection
arguments.
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
statutory
argument
obviously
is
different
--
different
and
as
we’ve
indicated
it
won’t
support
the
injunction
that
was
granted
below.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that’s
very
true.
but
hew
has
never
said
we’re
not
in
compliance
except
in
effect
in
their
brief
in
this
court.
the
letter
from
their
commissioner
which
is
the
only
evidence
otherwise
that
we
have
indicates
that
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
we
are,
because
--
well,
let
me
rephrase
it
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
the
answer
to
that
mr.
justice
white,
varies
with
the
item
we’re
talking
about
in
the
case
of
the
locks,
and
window
guards,
and
taxi
rides,
and
the
other
things
that
go
with
the
higher
crime
rate
in
the
new
york
city
ghettos
and
that’s
a
matter
of
fact,
i
mean
no
doubt
this
crime
in
buffalo
and
in
yonkers
and
we’re
not
going
to
suggest
that
there
isn’t,
but
statistically
it’s
enormously
greater
in
new
york
than
it
is
in
the
rest
of
the
state
if
you
make
that
division.
and
the
case
of
those
things
no
doubt
a
lot
would
cost
the
same
wherever
you
bought
one
but
if
you
don’t
need
a
lock
living
in
a
small
town,
or
if
you
needed
even
less
in
a
suburb
and
you
needed
more
in
new
york
city,
the
legislature
has
a
right
to
take
that
into
account
and
give
the
new
york
city
welfare
recipient
a
little
bit
more
money
for
that
cab
ride,
for
that
lock
to
pay
the
sales
tax
which
concededly
doesn’t
exist
in
these
are
the
places.
mr.
philip
weinberg
precisely.
mr.
philip
weinberg
not
because
any
individual
items
except
for
the
sales
tax
cost
more,
but
the
components
that
go
into
a
person’s
way
of
life
simply
require
more
money
in
new
york
city.
a
standard
of
need
isn’t
some
kind
of
an
ironclad
procrustean
thing,
as
i
tried
to
indicate
in
mentioning
razorblades
and
things
like
that.
a
welfare
recipient
has
to
buy
what
he
needs
in
order
to
survive
and
if
the
legislature
found
that
it
takes
more
in
new
york
city
then
certainly
it
didn’t
have
to
so
find
that’s
debatable,
but
how
can
it
not
be
objective
and
equitable
for
them
so
find
and
how
can
it
be
a
violation
of
a
statute
saying
they
have
to
have
a
statewide
standard
of
need
when
they
have
a
statewide
standard
of
need.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
think
it’s
obvious
that
there’s
a
higher
crime
rate
and
sales
tax
in
new
york
city,
the
other
factors
aren’t
so
obvious
and
then
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
we
never
got
very
far
in
the
dialog
with
hew
because
all
that
ever
happened
was
their
regional
commissioner
callison
wrote
us
a
letter
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
that’s
true,
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
litigation,
but
as
the
government
indicated
lower
level
discussions
have
been
going
on,
we’ve
never
heard
a
definite
pronouncement
from
hew
except
for
the
brief
that
they
filed
here.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we’ve
been
trying
to
demonstrate
it
all
along.
we’ve
certainly
prepared
to
demonstrate
it
whether
before
hew
or
before
the
district
court.
we’ve
attempted
to
demonstrate
here
to
the
extent
necessary
to
reverse
these
injunctions
that
these
things
are
debatable.
i’m
not
suggesting
that
they’re
obvious
certainly
reasonable
minds
can
differ
in
as
mr.
justice
marshall
indicated
in
his
earlier
questioning
that
certain
things
may
not
be
necessary
for
certain
people
and
perhaps
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
we’re
immune
from
litigation
on
this
point
if
we
had
it
a
patently
arbitrary
standard
then
we
wouldn’t
make
the
statutory
criterion?
mr.
philip
weinberg
oh
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
i
think
that’s
why
hew
wants
a
conformity
hearing
to
the
extent
that
--
but
it
seems
to
me
when
you
look
at
the
words
objective
and
equitable
which
are
employed
in
the
hew
regulations,
they’re
really
imposing
their
own
reasonable
man
test.
now,
perhaps
at
a
conformity
hearing,
they
would
have
the
last
word,
these
are
the
states
subject
to
the
states
appeal
through
the
courts
but
they’re
imposing
their
own
reasonable
man
test.
special
grants
are
an
individual
thing
and
in
the
rosado
case
this
court
may
quite
a
point
of
saying
that
individual
special
grants
were
important.
indeed
this
court
noted
that
new
york
city
lost
its
special
advantage
which
it
previously
had
when
individual
grants
were
eliminated
in
rosado.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
agree.
all
congress
said,
it
was
that
there
has
to
be
a
uniform
statewide
plan.
mr.
philip
weinberg
right.
mr.
philip
weinberg
we’ve
talked
about
the
question
of
whether
new
york
was
arbitrary
or
within
the
embed
of
the
legislatures
permissible
discretion
because
the
injunction
we’re
appealing
was
based
solely
under
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
philip
weinberg
well,
as
to
that
even
if
it
is,
we
submit
the
injunction
still
have
to
be
reversed
and
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
agree
that’s
a
separate
issue.
and
as
to
the
propriety
of
hew’s
used
when
the
wrong
regulations
used
words
like
objective
and
equitable,
no
doubt
you’ve
got
give
the
practical
--
the
benefit
of
the
practical
construction
of
the
statute
that
an
administrative
agency
administering
a
system
is
entitled
to
one
of
the
cases,
although
here,
it’s
an
awkward
here
as
we
indicated
yesterday
that
there’s
no
long
consistent
history
of
construction.
in
fact
they’ve
ignored
this
problem
until
this
case
and
get
ordered
in
this
until
the
appeal
came
to
this
court.
they
weren’t
heard
from
in
the
district
court.
mr.
philip
weinberg
there’s
also
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
question
of
whether
a
violation
of
the
regulation
alone
and
the
regulation
uses
the
words
objective
and
equitable
would
constitute
nonconformity.
that’s
not
nonconformity
with
an
act
of
congress
as
we
had
in
rosado
or
in
king
against
smith.
that’s
merely
a
regulation
and
--
i
question
again
as
we
indicated
in
our
reply
brief
whether
that
would
be
sufficient
to
grant
this
injunction
or
any
injunction
for
that
matter.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
the
injunction
below
was
based
solely
on
the
equal
protection
clause
the
court
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
no,
didn’t
they
--
mr.
philip
weinberg
we
say
that
a
legislature
has
to
have
discretion
to
deal
with
these
problems
as
it
sees
fit
and
that
what
the
court
below
did
just
as
plain
as
day,
mr.
justice
black
was
to
substitute
its
own
views
on
policy
for
what
the
constitution
commands.
mr.
philip
weinberg
it
certainly
would.
that
was
just
our
point
and
we’ve
kept
--
we’ve
kept
try
to
keep
in
focus
throughout
this
appeal
that
that
was
the
ground
on
which
the
court
below
acted.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
think
there’s
365
if
i’m
not
mistaken.
mr.
philip
weinberg
i
don’t
think
it’s
an
issue
that
belongs
in
this
court
barring
some
discrimination
on
the
ground
of
[inaudible]
they’re
obvious
basis
like
that.
mr.
philip
weinberg
that’s
exactly
our
point
here.
we
think
the
legislature
had
a
right
to
make
a
findings
such
as
it
did
that
based
on
certain
things
which
are
somewhat
intangible
in
some
instances
and
quite
tangible
like
a
sales
tax
and
other
instances,
had
a
right
to
find
that
the
ghetto
resident,
the
welfare
recipient
in
new
york
city
was
entitled
to
a
little
bit
extra
compensate
with
those
factors.
and
it’s
ironic
that
this
litigation
came
up
at
a
time
when
every
enlightened
social
commentator
was
asking
people
to
do
more
about
the
cities
and
to
concern
themselves
with
the
problems
of
the
urban
core.
mr.
philip
weinberg
mr.
justice
black
we’ve
tried
to
indicate
throughout
that
we
don’t
think
the
equal
protection
clause
reaches
that
far
unless
if
where
a
case
of
something
like
racial
discrimination
or
just
complete
patent
arbitrariness
where
the
state
just
didn’t
come
forward
with
anything
at
all.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
they
certainly
did.
they
completely
violated
what
this
court
said
in
dandridge
and
what
this
court
has
said
earlier
in
cases
like
mcdonald
which
we
cited
to
them.
mr.
philip
weinberg
in
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
yes
sir,
i
believe
so
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
it
would
be
an
appeal
from
the
hew
determination
through
the
courts
it
would
be,
i
assume
a
single-judge
district
court
along,
i’m
frankly
not
sure.
mr.
philip
weinberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
weinberg
precisely.
and
for
all
of
those
reasons,
we
submit
that
these
injunction
should
be
reversed
for
the
reasons
we’ve
suggested.
