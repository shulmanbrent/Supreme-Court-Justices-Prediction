mr.
j.
edwin
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
touch
briefly
in
the
beginning
on
the
point
that
was
discussed
as
to
the
contents
of
the
indictment
in
this
to
make
this
specific
that
we
submit
that
an
offense
is
not
charged
when
you
charged
only
that
feel
to
make
to
answer
something
in
one
of
the
government's
forms
that
that
is
not
a
false
statement
just
by
omitting
this
particular
portion
of
the
question
and
the
reading
of
the
indictment
will
disclose
that
that's
all
that
the
government
charged.
they
didn't
charge,
that
he
put
none,
that
he
put
three
when
he
should
have
put
five,
and
just
said
that
he
didn't
answer
this,
instead,
he
didn't
give
their
names,
addresses,
staff
numbers
and
so
forth.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
not
only
as
affirmative
ruling
in
his
opinion,
no
sir.
that
point
was
raised
in
the
end
and
the
motion
to
challenge
the
indictment
that
the
indictment
did
not
state
in
effect.
and
we
urge
in
our
brief
here
that
two
state
authorities
not
in
the
federal
but
the
one
with
fine
that
such
a
charge
is
not
a
false
statement.
and
i
--
that
point
we
submit
indictment
itself
just
look
at
it
they
are
not
charged
an
offense
when
it's
an
omission
to
make
a
statement.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
believe
that
at
any
time,
a
criminal
defendant
can
challenge
this
sufficiency
of
the
indictment.
i
maybe
wrong
on
my
particular
phase
of
the
rules,
but
i
think
that
could
be
raised
almost
anytime.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
that
maybe
--
i'll
be
frank
with
you,
i
couldn't
answer
the
question
as
to
your
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
then
if
i
may
then
turn
to
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
problem
involved
here,
and
i
think
that
the
government
in
its
position
here
has
wholly
failed
to
recognize
that
if
a
statement
made,
assuming
he
made
a
false
statement
was
made,
it
was
made
under
the
compulsion
of
criminal
sanctions
if
he
didn't
make
a
statement.
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
marchetti
and
grosso
that
these
tax
stamps
--
statutes
are
unconstitutional
that
to
require,
they
file
these
stamped
tax
returns,
information
returns
is
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
immunity
against
self-incrimination.
now,
this
poses
a
very
fundamental
point
as
to
whether
the
united
states
government
can
by
use
of
a
unconstitutional
statute
which
deprived
a
man
of
his
fifth
amendment
immunity,
when
here
--
in
compelling
to
do
that
under
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
then
turn
around
and
persecute
him
on
a
1001
if
he
makes
a
false
statement
in
that
coerced
information.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
agree
with
your
honors
on
that
point,
mr.
justice
black
and
i
think
i've
urged
it
explicitly
in
my
brief
from
the
very
beginning
that
i
think
the
government
in
this
situation
come
before
this
court
or
in
this
prosecution
with
unclean
hands.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
he
could've
done
that,
yes
sir,
but
the
constitution
says,
either
you
committed
a
crime,
the
most
vile
crime,
you
can't
be
compelled
to
give
information
incriminating
yourself.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
do
you
mean
had
he
stopped
to
gambling
since
he
filed
that
return?
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
doubt
it.
i
don't
know
whether
he
is
still
gambling
or
not.
i
don't
know
about
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
don't
think
that
exhibit
helps
the
indictment
because
i
think
you
got
to
look
at
the
indictment
of
what
it
says
and
this
is
something
that
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
would
say
this
that
the
indictment
when
it
says
that
he
is
guilty
of
1001
because
he
failed
to
answer
a
question;
doesn't
charge
a
false
statement.
i
don't
think
you
can
be
guilty
before
statement
by
not
making
man
answer.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
raised
it
in
my
brief.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
well,
that
was
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
makes
another
that
a
ball
and
i
wouldn't
be
making
the
point
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
i
was
trying
to
answer
this
court.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
this
point,
they
did
not
state
in
defense
was
raised
in
the
challenges
to
the
indictment
at
trial,
but
only
constitutional
question.
i
emphasize
here
that
there
was
a
court
--
statute
here
of
the
government
of
this
man
being
required
to
file
this
return
or
if
he
didn't
file
it,
being
faced
with
prosecution,
$10,000
fine
and
imprisonment.
and
here
is
the
government
saying,
you
do
this,
you
file
this
thing,
you
give
us
this
incriminating
information
or
we'll
prosecute
you
for
not
giving
it
under
7203
and
punish
you
with
a
$10,000
fine
and
imprisonment.
if
you
come
along
and
give
us
some
incriminating
evidence
however
and
it's
not
quite
true,
we'll
then
prosecute
you
under
the
1001.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
back
in
1964.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
that
is
correct
and
that's
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
situation
there
was
that
the
issue
of
compelling
to
give
the
incriminating
information
was
being
upheld
in
the
situation
of
kahriger-lewis
that
this
was
one
of
the
compulsive
points
that
he
is
having
to
file
that
it
was
the
rule
that
bore
on
his
having
to
file
or
be
prosecuted
under
7203
for
not
filing.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
don't
think
this
question
of
retroactivity
because
in
this
particular
case,
knox
has
raised
the
issue
at
the
very
moment
of
the
trial
level
of
challenge
the
indictment,
and
this
court
has
held
in
grosso
and
in
covington,
i
believe
in
leary,
marchetti,
all
of
those
that
this
challenge
raised
by
motion
challenging
the
indictment
is
unquestionably
timely.
i
believe
that's
expressed
time
at
time
by
the
authors
of
those
opinions.
and
as
to
coercive,
i
think
that
this
appeal
here
should
be
looked
at
if
i
may
so
suggest
in
the
light
of
garrity
and
spivak
decisions.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
would
suggest
this
if
please
mr.
chief
justice
burger
that
here's
a
man
that
has
a
situation
if
he
doesn't
file
this
return,
he
is
threaten
to
with
criminal
prosecution
under
article
26,
section
7203
and
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
well,
i
think
his
willful
figure
to
file
is
the
offense.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
this
is
applicable
to
a
specific
special
class
of
people
here
like
was
mentioned
to
same-same
group
or
the
class.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
sir?
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
using
this
language,
accused
gamblers
under
these
particular
statutes.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
believe
this
court
rejected
that
concept
in
overruling
kahriger
and
lewis
when
they
came
with
marchetti
and
grosso.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
this
that
under
the
rulings
of
garrity
and
spivak,
he
had
the
choice
here
either
to
file
or
to
be
prosecuted.
in
the
garrity
case,
i
believe
that
this
court
held
that
where
the
situation
was
such
that
you
had
the
choice
between
losing
your
job
or
giving
the
incriminating
information
that
that
was
coercion.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
yes,
he
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
he
had
the
third
alternative
of
course
of
not
to
gamble;
i
can
--
understand
that
in
filling
this
return.
but
at
the
same
time
in
garrity,
they
had
the
alternative
of
not
continue
to
be
a
policeman.
in
spivak,
he
had
the
opportunity
of
not
continue
to
be
a
lawyer.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
in
some
states,
gambling
is
an
honest
and
illegal
activity
also,
but
it
declared
in
the
state
of
texas,
he
was
not.
this
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
think
mr.
justice
black
in
kahriger;
you
yourself
said
that
the
bill
of
rights
applied,
but
that
the
gambler
has
a
right
himself
also
to
rely
on
the
bill
of
rights,
that's
almost
what
you
said
verbatim
and
you
just
said
incorrect.
i
believe
or
may
that
in
just
effect
that
one
of
you
all
said
that
inquiry.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
in
dissent?
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
and
as
to
the
coercion
phase
of
these
particular
statutes,
i
recall
mr.
justice
brennan
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
grosso
and
marchetti.
i
believe
you
comment
that
that
the
very
purpose
of
these
statutes
was
to
coerce
evidence
–
incriminating
evidence
from
these
people
who
filed
these
statements.
and
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
1001
and
the
point
we
are
trying
to
make
here
is
that
the
fact
that
the
grosso
and
marchetti
hold
that
the
information
that
he
gave
here
was
required
by
an
unconstitutional
statute
that
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
assuming
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
to
file
this
information
all
that
returns.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
that's
our
argument,
yes
sir,
that
if
the
government
compels
him
to
do
something
by
this
unconstitutional
requirement
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
yes.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
in
the
sense
that
in
dennis,
kay
and
kapp;
all
of
those
were
where
the
individual
voluntarily
went
there
and
filed
those
applications
for
the
specific
purposes
of
obtaining
benefits
like
in
one
of
them
to
get
a
home
loan,
i
believe
it
was
in
another
one
to
--
has
made
a
false
statement
of
about
value
of
his
house
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
the
coercion
here
was
unless
you
file,
you'll
be
prosecuted
under
26-7203,
criminally
prosecute.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
this
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
know
because
i
must
submit
that
i
did
not
have
knowledge
of
these
particular
forms
that
government
exhibits
here
in
the
appendix
until
the
appellate
level
because
amendment
and
not
my
client
didn't
filed
that.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
but
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
and
i
think
was
coerce
in
doing
one
of
the
other
you
had
to.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
was
saying
he
was
coerced
into
filing
the
return,
now,
the
element
of
coercion
in
requiring
him
to
file
the
informational
return.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
he
wasn't
coerced
to
make
the
false
statement
assuming
it
was
a
false
statement
which
i
am
not
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
well
assuming
it
was
a
false
statement.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
would
not
say
that
he
was
coerced
to
false
about
it.
i
do
not
make
that
statement,
i
make
the
statement
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
submit
nor
sir,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
submit
to
this
that
when
the
government
requires
an
act
in
violation
of
its
own
fundamental
law
requires
you
to
file
a
return
that
violates
the
government's
own
constitution.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
may
i
illustrate
by
an
extreme
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
and
then
you
see
that
the
coercion
or
the
informational
return
must
be
aligned
along
with
a
1001
to
give
true
information
as
to
his
incriminating
activities.
and
i
might
make
these
points
in
sort
of
emphasizing
it
and
maybe
too
much,
but
i
think
it's
mentioned
in
my
brief.
assuming
that
you
were
coercing
the
man
to
make
statement
and
as
you
--
as
this
court
did
in
the
garrity
relates
this
to
physical
torture
of
illustration
that
you
stretch
him
on
the
rack
or
you
put
him
down
with
a
thumb
screw
or
something
of
that
kind
until
he
makes
a
statement.
you
coerce
it
by
physical
torture.
but
in
trying
to
get
relief
from
the
physical
torture,
he
makes
some
false
statements
in
the
answer
that
he
give
to
the
police.
under
the
analogy,
i
would
ask
the
government
would
they
prosecute
him
under
those
circumstances
for
the
false
statement.
and
i
think
this
court
has
pointed
out
to
number
of
opinions
and
garrity
i
believe
is
the
latest
that
there's
not
just
physical
torture,
but
the
refinement
at
times
of
things.
and
when
the
individual
citizen
is
faced
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
he
filed
one
of
his
informational
returns
or
as
to
drum
the
gamble
of
being
prosecuted
by
united
states
district
attorney
for
not
filing
it
and
they
--
prior
to
grosso
and
marchetti,
they
were
filed
everyday,
every
week
by
the
hundreds
over
the
country.
i
think
that
gets
into
a
question
of
coercion
and
it's
just
as
much
coercion
as
there
was
in
garrity,
it's
just
as
much
coercion
as
there
was
in
spivak
in
the
situation.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
but
this
court
has
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
excuse
me.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
but
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
let
me
make
this
point
or
maybe
or
maybe
it'll
help
answer
the
issue
you're
raising.
when
assuming
this
case
came
on
for
trial
on
the
merits
and
these
informational
returns
that
they
brought
up
here
and
exhibited
it
the
first
time
on
appeal
or
offered
in
evidence,
and
he
raises
the
objection
there
that
they
are
not
admissible
because
they
were
extracted
from
the
file
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
court
i
--
under
the
ruling
that
this
court
has
handed
down
in
garrity,
i
submit
would
be
legitimately
authorized
in
excluding
them
from
evidence.
and
under
those
circumstances
even
those
circumstances,
we
submit
that
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
sir.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
was
going
to
present
the
practicality
of
the
situation
where
i
believe
was
pointed
out
in
grosso
and
i
believe
in
covington
that
when
maybe
in
garrity
also
that
when
the
evidence
would
not
be
available
that
you
could
take
it
and
deal
with
it
on
appeal
here
at
this
court
to
conclude
it
under
the
substantial
justice
of
the
case.
and
under
that
of
course,
this
is
not
a
situation
that
all
acts
involved
in
bryson
or
the
case
that
was
argued
here
just
before,
this
is
not
a
matter
of
retroactivity.
we
have
raised
this
issue
from
the
inception
and
that
we
submit
that
it's
a
ripe
for
decision
and
that
the
--
this
also
gets
back
in
a
way
to
this
court's
order
opinion
in
boyd
versus
united
states
which
is
reemphasized
in
garrity
and
the
spivak
of
situation
where
the
--
when
the
government
by
unconstitutional
means
causes
a
man
to
do
something
or
forces
him
to
do
something,
they
required
him
to
do
this
under
criminal
sanctions.
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
this
from
dennis
and
kay
and
kapp
and
that
line
of
cases
that
those
cases
did
not
have
the
criminal
sanction
of
saying
that
in
the
very
inception,
you
got
to
come
and
do
this.
and
i
think
this
court
could
well
i
affirm
the
court
below
that
in
no
way
overruled
covington
rules
because
this
man
has
standing
here
in
the
sense
that
he
has
brought
this
issue
from
the
inception
of
the
trial.
and
in
all
of
your
decisions
this
court
has
held
that
the
issue
is
timely
when
raised
to
challenge
to
indictment
of
issues.
i
might
advert
in
concluding
make
one
sort
of
answer
of
the
report
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
false
statements
statutes
were
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
government's
--
authorize,
the
authorized
function
of
government,
i
believe
the
way
it
expressed
in
[inaudible],
i
submit
that
that
the
extraction
of
incriminating
evidence
from
citizens
is
not
an
authorized
function
of
government.
and
there
are
numbers
of
cases
by
this
court
where
you
have
held
that
when
the
governmental
official
took
an
oath
or
required
an
oath
or
the
tribunal
requiring
the
oath
was
not
authorized
to
require
the
oath,
that
there
could
be
no
charge
of
perjury,
the
cases
such
is
that
christopher,
the
baird
case,
united
states
versus
george,
united
states
versus
williams
and
robinson.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
on
page
10
under
section
3,
page
10.
the
internal
revenue
[inaudible]
was
forbidden
by
the
constitution
to
require
this
information.
now,
the
fifth
amendment
was
forbidden
as
you
have
held
in
grosso
and
marchetti.
consequently,
those
cases
are
christopher
versus
united
states,
baird
versus
united
states,
george
versus
united
states
are
applicable
because
if
they
had
no
constitutional
authority
to
require
the
information
that's
stronger,
then,
if
they
had
no
statutory
authority
to
require
it.
at
one
time
had
a
purported
statutory
authority
to
do
require
it,
but
this
court
has
said,
the
constitutional
overrode
that
and
took
away
that
jurisdiction
from
them
and
it's
settled
law
by
this
court
under
those
circumstances
that
where
like
in
the
christopher
case
where
there
was
not
a
forum
at
the
time
a
man
gave
false
testimony
before
constitutional
--
i
mean
before
a
congressional
committee
when
there
was
not
a
forum
co-existing
at
that
time.
they
said,
false
statements
made
there
cannot
be
the
basis
of
perjury
and
we
submit
to
that
where
that
the
situation
here
where
the
constitution
forbade
the
internal
revenue
service
to
get
this
information
that
they
had
no
authority
to
get
it.
just
like
in
christopher,
the
congressional
committee
at
that
particular
time
when
there
was
no
forum
present
had
no
authority
to
get
the
information,
that
there
can
be
no
basis
on
those
circumstances
of
a
charge
of
perjury
of
false
statement.
unless
this
court
has
another
question
i
submit
that's
--
i
believe
my
time
is
about
up
in
there.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
touch
briefly
in
the
beginning
on
the
point
that
was
discussed
as
to
the
contents
of
the
indictment
in
this
to
make
this
specific
that
we
submit
that
an
offense
is
not
charged
when
you
charged
only
that
feel
to
make
to
answer
something
in
one
of
the
government's
forms
that
that
is
not
a
false
statement
just
by
omitting
this
particular
portion
of
the
question
and
the
reading
of
the
indictment
will
disclose
that
that's
all
that
the
government
charged.
they
didn't
charge,
that
he
put
none,
that
he
put
three
when
he
should
have
put
five,
and
just
said
that
he
didn't
answer
this,
instead,
he
didn't
give
their
names,
addresses,
staff
numbers
and
so
forth.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
not
only
as
affirmative
ruling
in
his
opinion,
no
sir.
that
point
was
raised
in
the
end
and
the
motion
to
challenge
the
indictment
that
the
indictment
did
not
state
in
effect.
and
we
urge
in
our
brief
here
that
two
state
authorities
not
in
the
federal
but
the
one
with
fine
that
such
a
charge
is
not
a
false
statement.
and
i
--
that
point
we
submit
indictment
itself
just
look
at
it
they
are
not
charged
an
offense
when
it's
an
omission
to
make
a
statement.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
believe
that
at
any
time,
a
criminal
defendant
can
challenge
this
sufficiency
of
the
indictment.
i
maybe
wrong
on
my
particular
phase
of
the
rules,
but
i
think
that
could
be
raised
almost
anytime.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
that
maybe
--
i'll
be
frank
with
you,
i
couldn't
answer
the
question
as
to
your
jurisdiction.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
then
if
i
may
then
turn
to
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
problem
involved
here,
and
i
think
that
the
government
in
its
position
here
has
wholly
failed
to
recognize
that
if
a
statement
made,
assuming
he
made
a
false
statement
was
made,
it
was
made
under
the
compulsion
of
criminal
sanctions
if
he
didn't
make
a
statement.
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
marchetti
and
grosso
that
these
tax
stamps
--
statutes
are
unconstitutional
that
to
require,
they
file
these
stamped
tax
returns,
information
returns
is
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
immunity
against
self-incrimination.
now,
this
poses
a
very
fundamental
point
as
to
whether
the
united
states
government
can
by
use
of
a
unconstitutional
statute
which
deprived
a
man
of
his
fifth
amendment
immunity,
when
here
--
in
compelling
to
do
that
under
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
then
turn
around
and
persecute
him
on
a
1001
if
he
makes
a
false
statement
in
that
coerced
information.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
agree
with
your
honors
on
that
point,
mr.
justice
black
and
i
think
i've
urged
it
explicitly
in
my
brief
from
the
very
beginning
that
i
think
the
government
in
this
situation
come
before
this
court
or
in
this
prosecution
with
unclean
hands.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
he
could've
done
that,
yes
sir,
but
the
constitution
says,
either
you
committed
a
crime,
the
most
vile
crime,
you
can't
be
compelled
to
give
information
incriminating
yourself.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
do
you
mean
had
he
stopped
to
gambling
since
he
filed
that
return?
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
doubt
it.
i
don't
know
whether
he
is
still
gambling
or
not.
i
don't
know
about
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
don't
think
that
exhibit
helps
the
indictment
because
i
think
you
got
to
look
at
the
indictment
of
what
it
says
and
this
is
something
that
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
would
say
this
that
the
indictment
when
it
says
that
he
is
guilty
of
1001
because
he
failed
to
answer
a
question;
doesn't
charge
a
false
statement.
i
don't
think
you
can
be
guilty
before
statement
by
not
making
man
answer.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
raised
it
in
my
brief.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
well,
that
was
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
makes
another
that
a
ball
and
i
wouldn't
be
making
the
point
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
i
was
trying
to
answer
this
court.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
this
point,
they
did
not
state
in
defense
was
raised
in
the
challenges
to
the
indictment
at
trial,
but
only
constitutional
question.
i
emphasize
here
that
there
was
a
court
--
statute
here
of
the
government
of
this
man
being
required
to
file
this
return
or
if
he
didn't
file
it,
being
faced
with
prosecution,
$10,000
fine
and
imprisonment.
and
here
is
the
government
saying,
you
do
this,
you
file
this
thing,
you
give
us
this
incriminating
information
or
we'll
prosecute
you
for
not
giving
it
under
7203
and
punish
you
with
a
$10,000
fine
and
imprisonment.
if
you
come
along
and
give
us
some
incriminating
evidence
however
and
it's
not
quite
true,
we'll
then
prosecute
you
under
the
1001.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
back
in
1964.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
that
is
correct
and
that's
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
situation
there
was
that
the
issue
of
compelling
to
give
the
incriminating
information
was
being
upheld
in
the
situation
of
kahriger-lewis
that
this
was
one
of
the
compulsive
points
that
he
is
having
to
file
that
it
was
the
rule
that
bore
on
his
having
to
file
or
be
prosecuted
under
7203
for
not
filing.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
don't
think
this
question
of
retroactivity
because
in
this
particular
case,
knox
has
raised
the
issue
at
the
very
moment
of
the
trial
level
of
challenge
the
indictment,
and
this
court
has
held
in
grosso
and
in
covington,
i
believe
in
leary,
marchetti,
all
of
those
that
this
challenge
raised
by
motion
challenging
the
indictment
is
unquestionably
timely.
i
believe
that's
expressed
time
at
time
by
the
authors
of
those
opinions.
and
as
to
coercive,
i
think
that
this
appeal
here
should
be
looked
at
if
i
may
so
suggest
in
the
light
of
garrity
and
spivak
decisions.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
would
suggest
this
if
please
mr.
chief
justice
burger
that
here's
a
man
that
has
a
situation
if
he
doesn't
file
this
return,
he
is
threaten
to
with
criminal
prosecution
under
article
26,
section
7203
and
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
well,
i
think
his
willful
figure
to
file
is
the
offense.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
this
is
applicable
to
a
specific
special
class
of
people
here
like
was
mentioned
to
same-same
group
or
the
class.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
sir?
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
using
this
language,
accused
gamblers
under
these
particular
statutes.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
believe
this
court
rejected
that
concept
in
overruling
kahriger
and
lewis
when
they
came
with
marchetti
and
grosso.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
this
that
under
the
rulings
of
garrity
and
spivak,
he
had
the
choice
here
either
to
file
or
to
be
prosecuted.
in
the
garrity
case,
i
believe
that
this
court
held
that
where
the
situation
was
such
that
you
had
the
choice
between
losing
your
job
or
giving
the
incriminating
information
that
that
was
coercion.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
yes,
he
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
he
had
the
third
alternative
of
course
of
not
to
gamble;
i
can
--
understand
that
in
filling
this
return.
but
at
the
same
time
in
garrity,
they
had
the
alternative
of
not
continue
to
be
a
policeman.
in
spivak,
he
had
the
opportunity
of
not
continue
to
be
a
lawyer.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
in
some
states,
gambling
is
an
honest
and
illegal
activity
also,
but
it
declared
in
the
state
of
texas,
he
was
not.
this
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
think
mr.
justice
black
in
kahriger;
you
yourself
said
that
the
bill
of
rights
applied,
but
that
the
gambler
has
a
right
himself
also
to
rely
on
the
bill
of
rights,
that's
almost
what
you
said
verbatim
and
you
just
said
incorrect.
i
believe
or
may
that
in
just
effect
that
one
of
you
all
said
that
inquiry.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
in
dissent?
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
and
as
to
the
coercion
phase
of
these
particular
statutes,
i
recall
mr.
justice
brennan
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
grosso
and
marchetti.
i
believe
you
comment
that
that
the
very
purpose
of
these
statutes
was
to
coerce
evidence
–
incriminating
evidence
from
these
people
who
filed
these
statements.
and
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
1001
and
the
point
we
are
trying
to
make
here
is
that
the
fact
that
the
grosso
and
marchetti
hold
that
the
information
that
he
gave
here
was
required
by
an
unconstitutional
statute
that
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
assuming
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
to
file
this
information
all
that
returns.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
that's
our
argument,
yes
sir,
that
if
the
government
compels
him
to
do
something
by
this
unconstitutional
requirement
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
yes.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
in
the
sense
that
in
dennis,
kay
and
kapp;
all
of
those
were
where
the
individual
voluntarily
went
there
and
filed
those
applications
for
the
specific
purposes
of
obtaining
benefits
like
in
one
of
them
to
get
a
home
loan,
i
believe
it
was
in
another
one
to
--
has
made
a
false
statement
of
about
value
of
his
house
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
the
coercion
here
was
unless
you
file,
you'll
be
prosecuted
under
26-7203,
criminally
prosecute.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
this
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
do
not
know
because
i
must
submit
that
i
did
not
have
knowledge
of
these
particular
forms
that
government
exhibits
here
in
the
appendix
until
the
appellate
level
because
amendment
and
not
my
client
didn't
filed
that.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
but
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
and
i
think
was
coerce
in
doing
one
of
the
other
you
had
to.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
was
saying
he
was
coerced
into
filing
the
return,
now,
the
element
of
coercion
in
requiring
him
to
file
the
informational
return.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
he
wasn't
coerced
to
make
the
false
statement
assuming
it
was
a
false
statement
which
i
am
not
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
well
assuming
it
was
a
false
statement.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
would
not
say
that
he
was
coerced
to
false
about
it.
i
do
not
make
that
statement,
i
make
the
statement
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
submit
nor
sir,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
submit
to
this
that
when
the
government
requires
an
act
in
violation
of
its
own
fundamental
law
requires
you
to
file
a
return
that
violates
the
government's
own
constitution.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
may
i
illustrate
by
an
extreme
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
and
then
you
see
that
the
coercion
or
the
informational
return
must
be
aligned
along
with
a
1001
to
give
true
information
as
to
his
incriminating
activities.
and
i
might
make
these
points
in
sort
of
emphasizing
it
and
maybe
too
much,
but
i
think
it's
mentioned
in
my
brief.
assuming
that
you
were
coercing
the
man
to
make
statement
and
as
you
--
as
this
court
did
in
the
garrity
relates
this
to
physical
torture
of
illustration
that
you
stretch
him
on
the
rack
or
you
put
him
down
with
a
thumb
screw
or
something
of
that
kind
until
he
makes
a
statement.
you
coerce
it
by
physical
torture.
but
in
trying
to
get
relief
from
the
physical
torture,
he
makes
some
false
statements
in
the
answer
that
he
give
to
the
police.
under
the
analogy,
i
would
ask
the
government
would
they
prosecute
him
under
those
circumstances
for
the
false
statement.
and
i
think
this
court
has
pointed
out
to
number
of
opinions
and
garrity
i
believe
is
the
latest
that
there's
not
just
physical
torture,
but
the
refinement
at
times
of
things.
and
when
the
individual
citizen
is
faced
with
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
he
filed
one
of
his
informational
returns
or
as
to
drum
the
gamble
of
being
prosecuted
by
united
states
district
attorney
for
not
filing
it
and
they
--
prior
to
grosso
and
marchetti,
they
were
filed
everyday,
every
week
by
the
hundreds
over
the
country.
i
think
that
gets
into
a
question
of
coercion
and
it's
just
as
much
coercion
as
there
was
in
garrity,
it's
just
as
much
coercion
as
there
was
in
spivak
in
the
situation.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
but
this
court
has
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
excuse
me.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
but
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
let
me
make
this
point
or
maybe
or
maybe
it'll
help
answer
the
issue
you're
raising.
when
assuming
this
case
came
on
for
trial
on
the
merits
and
these
informational
returns
that
they
brought
up
here
and
exhibited
it
the
first
time
on
appeal
or
offered
in
evidence,
and
he
raises
the
objection
there
that
they
are
not
admissible
because
they
were
extracted
from
the
file
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
court
i
--
under
the
ruling
that
this
court
has
handed
down
in
garrity,
i
submit
would
be
legitimately
authorized
in
excluding
them
from
evidence.
and
under
those
circumstances
even
those
circumstances,
we
submit
that
--
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
sir.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
i
was
going
to
present
the
practicality
of
the
situation
where
i
believe
was
pointed
out
in
grosso
and
i
believe
in
covington
that
when
maybe
in
garrity
also
that
when
the
evidence
would
not
be
available
that
you
could
take
it
and
deal
with
it
on
appeal
here
at
this
court
to
conclude
it
under
the
substantial
justice
of
the
case.
and
under
that
of
course,
this
is
not
a
situation
that
all
acts
involved
in
bryson
or
the
case
that
was
argued
here
just
before,
this
is
not
a
matter
of
retroactivity.
we
have
raised
this
issue
from
the
inception
and
that
we
submit
that
it's
a
ripe
for
decision
and
that
the
--
this
also
gets
back
in
a
way
to
this
court's
order
opinion
in
boyd
versus
united
states
which
is
reemphasized
in
garrity
and
the
spivak
of
situation
where
the
--
when
the
government
by
unconstitutional
means
causes
a
man
to
do
something
or
forces
him
to
do
something,
they
required
him
to
do
this
under
criminal
sanctions.
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
this
from
dennis
and
kay
and
kapp
and
that
line
of
cases
that
those
cases
did
not
have
the
criminal
sanction
of
saying
that
in
the
very
inception,
you
got
to
come
and
do
this.
and
i
think
this
court
could
well
i
affirm
the
court
below
that
in
no
way
overruled
covington
rules
because
this
man
has
standing
here
in
the
sense
that
he
has
brought
this
issue
from
the
inception
of
the
trial.
and
in
all
of
your
decisions
this
court
has
held
that
the
issue
is
timely
when
raised
to
challenge
to
indictment
of
issues.
i
might
advert
in
concluding
make
one
sort
of
answer
of
the
report
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
false
statements
statutes
were
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
government's
--
authorize,
the
authorized
function
of
government,
i
believe
the
way
it
expressed
in
[inaudible],
i
submit
that
that
the
extraction
of
incriminating
evidence
from
citizens
is
not
an
authorized
function
of
government.
and
there
are
numbers
of
cases
by
this
court
where
you
have
held
that
when
the
governmental
official
took
an
oath
or
required
an
oath
or
the
tribunal
requiring
the
oath
was
not
authorized
to
require
the
oath,
that
there
could
be
no
charge
of
perjury,
the
cases
such
is
that
christopher,
the
baird
case,
united
states
versus
george,
united
states
versus
williams
and
robinson.
mr.
j.
edwin
smith
on
page
10
under
section
3,
page
10.
the
internal
revenue
[inaudible]
was
forbidden
by
the
constitution
to
require
this
information.
now,
the
fifth
amendment
was
forbidden
as
you
have
held
in
grosso
and
marchetti.
consequently,
those
cases
are
christopher
versus
united
states,
baird
versus
united
states,
george
versus
united
states
are
applicable
because
if
they
had
no
constitutional
authority
to
require
the
information
that's
stronger,
then,
if
they
had
no
statutory
authority
to
require
it.
at
one
time
had
a
purported
statutory
authority
to
do
require
it,
but
this
court
has
said,
the
constitutional
overrode
that
and
took
away
that
jurisdiction
from
them
and
it's
settled
law
by
this
court
under
those
circumstances
that
where
like
in
the
christopher
case
where
there
was
not
a
forum
at
the
time
a
man
gave
false
testimony
before
constitutional
--
i
mean
before
a
congressional
committee
when
there
was
not
a
forum
co-existing
at
that
time.
they
said,
false
statements
made
there
cannot
be
the
basis
of
perjury
and
we
submit
to
that
where
that
the
situation
here
where
the
constitution
forbade
the
internal
revenue
service
to
get
this
information
that
they
had
no
authority
to
get
it.
just
like
in
christopher,
the
congressional
committee
at
that
particular
time
when
there
was
no
forum
present
had
no
authority
to
get
the
information,
that
there
can
be
no
basis
on
those
circumstances
of
a
charge
of
perjury
of
false
statement.
unless
this
court
has
another
question
i
submit
that's
--
i
believe
my
time
is
about
up
in
there.
