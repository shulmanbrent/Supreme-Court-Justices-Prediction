1914.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
is
unpatentable
in
view
of
the
past
art
and
this
patent.
anything
that's
unpatentable
is
covered
by
the
doctrine
of
equivalence?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
free
area.
see
there,
it
can
either
be
covered
by
a
future
patent
or
it's
covered
by
the
2546.
unknown
speaker
well
is
there
some
language
about
claims
in
the
52
act
that
is
different
than
the
language
under
which
graver
was
decided?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
language
that
you
think
is
inconsistent
with
the
doctrine
of
equivalence?
unknown
speaker
well
is
the
claim
language
in
the
52
act
similar
to
what
it
was
before
identical?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
graver
then
just
has
to
be
overruled
is
in
your
position,
according
to
your
position?
unknown
speaker
because
there's
nothing
in
the
52
act
which
--
unknown
speaker
well
how
about
then
--
how
about
congress
then
intending
to
adapt
graver
tank?
i
didn't
think
that
the
--
do
you
think
that
the
--
expressly
stated
otherwise,
wasn't
the
act
intended
to
cut
it
by
existing
law?
unknown
speaker
well
i
know,
but
it
intended
cut
it
by
existing
law,
didn't
it?
i
mean
what
about
on
the
infringement
section?
i
never
use
to
be
in
infringement
section.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
it
certainly
--
do
you
think
was
intended
to
do
to
adapt
the
existing
law
about
infringement
of
which
equivalence
was
a
major
part.
unknown
speaker
are
we
going
very
often
at
the
rules,
that's
very
destructive.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
the
rest
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
no
position
on
the
--
currently
on
the
leader
matter?
unknown
speaker
5324
department
of
trial
does?
unknown
speaker
5344
understand
that
there
could
be
no
issue
of
litigate
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
5410.
unknown
speaker
that
no
premier
law
would
require
the
attack.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
is
this
in
the
brief?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
get
to
that
mr.
kalish,
may
i
just
hereby
correctly
understand
your
position
on
the
other
point.
unknown
speaker
it's
this
that
the
--
as
i
understand
it,
the
patent
was
sold
to
standard
and
part
of
the
major
or
the
purchase
price
included
this
2%
override?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
3%?
unknown
speaker
but
your
point
is
this
was
just
a
measure
of
the
purchase
price
of
the
patent.
unknown
speaker
in
another
words
they
assumed
the
obligation
that
was
on
the
inventor.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
said.
unknown
speaker
but
the
whole
business
is
all
part
of
the
purchase
price
of
the
patent
that
they
bought,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore,
you
say
there
is
no
room
here
for
the
doctrine
of
licensee
estoppel
because
this
is
not
a
licensee
situation.
unknown
speaker
therefore,
i
take
it
with
a
follow
that
these
are
five-year
agreement
as
i
recall
about
it.
unknown
speaker
well
no
matter
what,
i
would
suppose
your
position
then
will
have
to,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
maybe
i
should
ask
you
a
question.
does
this
mean
that
no
matter
what
happened
to
the
patent,
standard
still
for
five
years
was
obliged
to
pay
on
all
of
its
sales
of
the
cover
items,
2%
override
and
3%
to
the
original
inventor?
do
you
say
that
whether
or
not
the
patent
was
invalid?
that
they
bought
something
--
for
which
this
is
what
they
pay.
unknown
speaker
well
i
understood
you,
wouldn't
your
argument
logically
mean
no
matter
what
happened
to
the
patent,
valid
or
invalid
that
since
they
pay
that
extra
hours
for
it,
measured
by
2%,
3%
quarterly,
they'd
still
have
to
continue
for
the
five
years
--
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
why,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
could
be
a
failure
consideration?
unknown
speaker
or
why
would
then
you
--
and
that's
true
even
though
this
is
an
assignment.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
don't
understand
you
estoppel
argument
at
all.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know
but
if
he
had
some
third
party
suite
--
in
some
of
the
third
party
suit
that
that
was
invalidated,
you
would
say
that
the
petitioner
here
would
be
excused
from
paying.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
nevertheless
that
he
is
stopped.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
you
say
he
hasn't
stopped.
unknown
speaker
well
you
make
a
good
argument
--
you
have
had
a
good
argument
arguing
for
the
result
mixed
in
lear,
right
across
the
board.
unknown
speaker
well
quite
apart
from
the
antitrust
laws,
i
supposed
this
was
a
sale
of
a
business
of
the
assets
of
the
business
including
as
you
say
inventory
and
maybe
i
don't
know
what
else,
office
equipment
and
a
couple
of
patents
and
if
the
or
any
or
all
are
in
part
of
that
--
those
assets
had
turned
out
to
be
effective
--
defective
or
not
as
represented
quite
apart
from
the
antitrust
laws.
i'm
supposed
the
installment
purchaser
would
have
had
a
claim
against
you
to
pay
full
purchase
price
quite
apart
from
antitrust
law.
he
could
attack
the
validity
--
the
patent
just
as
he
could
have
attacked
the
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
integrity
of
the
inventory.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
the
patent
is
issued
and
someone
thereafter
trials
for
patent
in
the
same
area
and
it's
denied
on
the
ground
that
it
was
obvious
from
the
previous
patent
and
the
prior,
would
that
all
--
would
you
therefore
say
that
what
the
fellow
was
trying
--
what
the
second
man
was
trying
to
patent
was
the
equivalent
of
the
first
patent?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
that's
--
anything
that's
obvious
from
the
prior
art
is
covered
by
those
prior
art
patents
in
the
doctrine
of
equivalents.
unknown
speaker
and
this
just
have
any
free
area.
it's
either
--
if
something's
unpatentable
it
must
be
because
it's
covered
by
a
prior
patent.
unknown
speaker
so
you
are
saying
that
there
can
be
some
nonpatentable
obvious
elements?
unknown
speaker
is
the
equivalent,
doctrine
of
equivalent
created
by
the
congress?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
‘52
code
has
so
much
significance
that
it
adopted
every
piece
of
statutory
interpretation
and
every
piece
of
decisional
law
prior
to
that
time
in
places
of
any
prior
--
any
decisions
prior
to
that
time
beyond
reach
of
this
court
or
any
other
court?
unknown
speaker
9833
of
things
that
specifically
did
away
with
some
prior
decision.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
then
that
lear
was
out
of
bounce?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
entirely
aside
from
whether
what
you
think
of
it
on
the
merits.
do
you
think
we
over
reached
the
power
of
the
courts
in
deciding
lear
because
in
1952
the
congress
didn't
express
any
disagreement
with
the
licensee
and
stuff
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
difference
between
--
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
those
arguments
be
as
applicable
to
the
lear
decision?
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
that?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you?
unknown
speaker
was
the
original
arrangement
between
the
inventor
and
the
respondent
here,
was
that
a
license?
unknown
speaker
and
all
that
the
licensee
then
assigned,
are
you
saying
to
standard
of
the
petitioner
was
its
license
interest?
unknown
speaker
well
are
to
--
whatever
the
subsidiary.
unknown
speaker
well,
who
owned
the
patent
after
the
assignment?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
concerned
about
that.
what
you
told
me
is
there
was
a
license
from
the
inventor
to
tigrett.
unknown
speaker
an
assignment?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
never
actually
been
a
formal
license
involved
in
this
case
at
all?
unknown
speaker
you
can
answer.
unknown
speaker
after
that,
did
your
subsidiary
jackson
furniture
had
get
an
assignment
from
tigrett
industries
--
unknown
speaker
after
tigrett
industries
had
made
a
license
to
standard,
you're
telling
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
then
tigrett
industries
assigned
the
patent
itself
to
your
subsidiary.
unknown
speaker
1914.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
is
unpatentable
in
view
of
the
past
art
and
this
patent.
anything
that's
unpatentable
is
covered
by
the
doctrine
of
equivalence?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
free
area.
see
there,
it
can
either
be
covered
by
a
future
patent
or
it's
covered
by
the
2546.
unknown
speaker
well
is
there
some
language
about
claims
in
the
52
act
that
is
different
than
the
language
under
which
graver
was
decided?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
language
that
you
think
is
inconsistent
with
the
doctrine
of
equivalence?
unknown
speaker
well
is
the
claim
language
in
the
52
act
similar
to
what
it
was
before
identical?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
graver
then
just
has
to
be
overruled
is
in
your
position,
according
to
your
position?
unknown
speaker
because
there's
nothing
in
the
52
act
which
--
unknown
speaker
well
how
about
then
--
how
about
congress
then
intending
to
adapt
graver
tank?
i
didn't
think
that
the
--
do
you
think
that
the
--
expressly
stated
otherwise,
wasn't
the
act
intended
to
cut
it
by
existing
law?
unknown
speaker
well
i
know,
but
it
intended
cut
it
by
existing
law,
didn't
it?
i
mean
what
about
on
the
infringement
section?
i
never
use
to
be
in
infringement
section.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
it
certainly
--
do
you
think
was
intended
to
do
to
adapt
the
existing
law
about
infringement
of
which
equivalence
was
a
major
part.
unknown
speaker
are

that's
very

unknown

but
you
have
the

under

do
you
take
no
position
on
the

currently
on
the

unknown

5324
department
of

does?
unknown
speaker
5344
understand
that
there

5410.

i

why,

do
you

or

you

and
that's

even

unknown

why
not?
unknown

well
then
i
don't
understand
you
estoppel
argument
at

unknown

oh,
i

but
if
he
had
some

that
that
was

you
would

but
you
say
nevertheless
that

unknown

i
know
but
you
say
he
hasn't
stopped.
unknown

well
you
make

you
