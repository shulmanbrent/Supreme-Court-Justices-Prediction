mr.
jacob
abramson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
learned
counsel
has
stated
that
the
dispositive
issue
in
this
case
is
the
purpose
of
the
arizona
law,
what
is
the
purpose?
it
is
already
been
made
clear
what
the
purpose
is,
and
this
is
to
achieve
credit
and
to
the
state
of
arizona
for
a
good
fruit.
the
concern
is
not
about
receiving
discredit
for
poor
fruit
because
in
this
case,
the
poor
fruit
is
going
to
be
packed
in
other
states.
it's
to
receive
credit
for
a
good
fruit.
now,
we
submit
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
mr.
chief
justice,
the
argument
of
appellant
is
that
parker
fruit
is
good
fruit
and
he
wants
it
to
be
labeled
as
good
fruit.
this
is
the
main
concern
and
his
argument.
he
states
this
repeatedly
that
it's
to
enhance
the
reputation
by
identifying
the
fruit
as
arizona
fruit.
the
point
i'm
getting
to
is
that
the
determining
question
here
is
not
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
arizona
law,
even
if
the
purpose
is
to
obtain
credit.
although,
this
court
has
never
gone
so
far
as
to
permit
what
the
appellant
seeks
to
do
here
in
furtherance
of
that
purpose,
even
to
achieve
credit
we
say
is
not
an
improper
purpose.
it's
fine
we
say
if
one
wants
to
do
a
good
job
and
to
get
credit
for
it,
but
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
how
far
may
the
state
of
arizona
go
in
trying
to
achieve
this
purpose?
in
order
to
achieve
this
purpose,
the
state
of
arizona
through
the
interpretation
of
the
arizona
law
by
the
appellant
is
saying
three
things
must
occur.
one,
the
packing
must
be
done
in
arizona;
two,
the
packing
must
be
done
in
packing
shed
in
arizona
and
in
the
context
of
this
case
where
the
church
company
does
not
have
packing
facilities
at
parker
and
indeed,
cannot
have
such
facility
because
there
are
no
railroad
lines
going
in
there,
must
construct
packing
facilities
at
parker.
to
be
sure
appellant
states,
now
the
law
doesn't
in
terms
say
you
must
do
this
and
therefore,
we
can't
hear
you
to
complain,
but
this
is
the
necessary
effect
of
his
order
and
in
fact,
the
appellant
in
its
brief
expressly
states
this
that
this
is
the
dilemma
in
which
the
appellee
finds
itself
that
in
order
to
comply
with
the
order,
it
must
do
these
three
things.
now,
we
submit
that
this
goes
too
far
in
its
encroachment
upon
the
federal
concern
with
maintaining
a
free-flow
of
interstate
commerce.
we
submit
it's
contrary
to
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
have
cited;
the
shrimp
cases
to
which
learned
counsel
has
alluded
to
in
his
statement.
we
submit
that
this
is
the
real
issue;
how
far
may
the
state
of
arizona
go
in
obtaining
credit
for
a
good
fruit
or
even
keeping
out
poor
fruit?
there
has
been
no
case
cited
by
appellant
in
which
this
court
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
these
three
requirements
maybe
imposed.
mr.
jacob
abramson
your
honor,
the
sligh
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
the
sligh
case
involved
a
statute
which
stated
simply
that
citrus
fruits
unfit
for
consumption
shall
not
be
handled.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
question
of
intrastate
–
interstate.
it
was
purely
a
criminal
statute
and
imposed
a
penalty
for
the
handling
of
such
fruit.
the
sligh
case
would
have
been
a
case
similar
to
ours.
if
the
state
in
that
case
had
said
this
citrus
fruit
must
be
packed
in
this
state,
but
that
was
not
the
situation
in
the
sligh
case.
mention
has
been
made
of
the
pacific
box
case.
this
involved
a
law
of
the
state
of
oregon
which
established
certain
standard
containers
to
be
used
for
packing
in
that
state
of
raspberries
and
strawberries.
an
out
of
state
manufacture
of
containers
challenged
this
law
saying
i
want
to
come
into
oregon
and
sell
my
containers
in
oregon,
these
were
different
containers
from
those
provided
on
the
oregon
law,
and
this
court
held
that
oregon
may
within
its
right
prescribe
containers,
but
their
case
did
not
involve
the
situation
such
as
here.
if
oregon
statute
said
raspberries
and
strawberries
must
be
packed
in
oregon,
this
would
have
presented
before
this
court
the
same
issue
which
it
has
before
it
now.
this
court
has
stated
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
we
submit
that
the
pacific
states
decision
was
correct
your
honor
that
a
state
may
provide
that
where
commodities
are
packed
within
the
state
certain
containers
shall
be
used.
but
i
submit
again
mr.
chief
justice
burger
that
the
statute
in
the
pacific
states
box
case
did
not
state
that
the
packing,
the
processing
and
packing
of
raspberries
and
strawberries
shall
be
performed
in
the
state
of
oregon.
had
it
done
so,
it
would
have
presented
the
same
issue
which
we
have
here.
mr.
jacob
abramson
turner
against
maryland
--
i
think
this
case
gets
--
this
case
gets
closer.
this
was
an
1882
case.
counsel
for
western
growers
has
stated
with
reference
to
that
case
that
it's
cited
a
long
string
of
statutes.
these
were
statutes
in
a
colonial
times,
much
has
happened
since
1882,
advancements
in
transportation,
processing,
packing,
handling,
and
of
course
this
court
since
that
time
has
rendered
decisions
in
the
toomer
v.
witsell,
the
heidell
cases,
the
dean
milk
case,
and
i
think
we're
moving
with
the
times.
this
court
has
stated
on
numerous
occasions
that
it
will
be
guarded
by
practical
considerations.
mr.
justice
white
has
already
touched
upon
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
namely
that
the
problem
which
brings
us
before
this
court
is
one
which
exists
in
the
border
districts
which
joined
the
states
of
california
and
arizona;
that
is
to
say
the
districts
along
the
colorado
river.
here,
the
same
climatic
conditions
prevail.
climate,
weather
atmospheric
conditions
know
no
state
borders,
and
that
given
the
same
growing
conditions,
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
same
grower
to
have
growing
operations
on
both
sides
of
the
border.
now,
the
question
was
raised;
what
is
the
area
of
production?
it's
not
too
great
mr.
justice
white
because
the
crops
which
are
involved
are
of
such
a
highly
perishable
nature
that
they
must
be
taken
out
of
the
ground,
processed,
packed
and
put
in
cars
on
their
way
within
the
matter
of
just
a
few
hours.
so,
the
distance
does
not
--
you're
not
--
you
don't
have
the
possibility
of
dealing
in
large
distances,
i
would
say
a
radius
of
30
miles,
40
miles,
something
of
that
nature.
the
church
company
the
appellee
here
has
operations
on
both
sides
as
you
know.
it
has
operations
at
parker
under
a
lease
with
the
colorado
river,
indian
tribes.
this
is
a
distance
of
25
miles
from
the
border
and
has
been
doing
its
packing
at
blight
on
the
california
side,
5
miles
over
on
the
california
side.
mr.
jacob
abramson
yes,
on
the
blight
side
and
because
these
are
growers
who
don't
enjoy
federal
subsidies,
whose
production
cost
and
transportation
and
costs
are
among
the
highest
in
the
nation.
their
success
or
failure
depends
on
their
ability
to
be
efficient,
and
this
means
to
economize.
so,
if
a
grower
of
this
kind
requires
packing
facilities,
he
will
put
them
on
one
side
of
the
line
or
the
other
wherever
they
fit
in
with
his
operations.
he's
obviously
not
going
to
duplicate
his
facilities.
now,
the
same
situation
exists
at
yuma
on
the
arizona
side
and
at
bard
on
the
california.
these
are
just
opposite
to
one
another,
across
the
river,
the
short
distance
of
possibly
5
miles
and
for
years,
there
has
been
transport
of
cantaloupes
and
other
commodities
from
the
california
side
at
bard
over
to
yuma
on
the
arizona
side
where
they
been
processed
and
packed
just
as
these
cantaloupes
had
been
at
blight.
california
as
you
know
has
a
law
very
similar.
we
can
draw
fine
lines
about
particular
words
or
sentences.
but
basically,
they're
the
same.
there's
testimony
in
the
record
that
the
california
law
and
inspection,
if
anything
is
more
stringent
than
the
arizona
law,
but
we
need
not
to
make
an
issue
of
this.
in
any
event,
it's
been
going
on
from
bard
to
yuma
for
a
long
time.
california
has
never
raised
the
question.
they
had
never
attempted
to
stop
this
practice.
they
reconciled
it
with
their
law.
california,
the
state
of
california
knows
about
this
pending
litigation
and
it
has
not
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
the
california
mr.
justice
white
does
have
a
law
similar
to
that
of
arizona
which
requires
some
identification
on
the
container.
the
record
shows
that
in
this
particular
case
where
the
same
containers,
very
same
containers
are
used
both
where
packing
is
done
in
arizona
and
in
california
has
imprinted
upon
it
packed
in
season
in
arizona
and
california,
main
office
salinas,
california.
this
is
where
the
main
office
of
the
church
company.
mr.
jacob
abramson
packed
in
season
in
arizona
and
california.
mr.
jacob
abramson
that's
our
trade,
yes.
mr.
jacob
abramson
this
is
what
appears
on
the
crate,
packed
and
seasoned
in
arizona
and
california
indicates
that
packing
may
go
one
in
each
state.
this
brings
me
to
another
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
in
response
to
this
point
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
i
should
explain
how
these
cantaloupes
are
marketed.
some
question
has
been
raised,
i
think
possibly
by
the
chief
justice
as
to
whether
these
commodities
are
identified
at
the
store
level,
but
they
are
not.
these
cantaloupes
are
sold
by
the
growers
to
a
small
group
of
buyers
who
are
present
right
there
on
the
spot.
they're
there
everyday,
they
are
their
representatives.
they
are
at
the
point
of
production,
whether
it's
the
packing
shed
or
field,
they're
inspecting
the
produce.
they
know
exactly
where
it's
been
grown.
they
know
who
the
grower
is.
they
know
the
quality
or
they
wouldn't
be
buying
it.
they're
there
to
inspect
the
quality.
mr.
jacob
abramson
these
are
wholesale
jobbers.
they're
distributors,
receivers,
but
who
have
their
representative's
right
there
on
the
spot
and
they
move
from
place
to
place
as
the
harvest
progresses.
mr.
jacob
abramson
their
customers
are
in
turn
are
receivers,
the
car
lot
receivers
all
over
the
country
who
receive
these
in
car
lots.
the
sales
are
in
car
lots
or
truckloads.
you
see,
they
are
not
sold
as
individual
packages.
and
eventually,
when
they
reach
their
terminus,
terminal
points
throughout
the
nation,
the
distributors
will
then
distribute
them
among
the
chain
stores
possibly,
among
retail
stores,
but
once
they
reach
the
store,
they're
taken
out
of
the
package
and
put
on
a
shelf.
the
housewife
doesn't
know
where
this
cantaloupe
has
come
from.
if
she
likes,
if
it
tastes
good,
she
will
come
back
and
buy
it.
so,
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
yes
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
the
sligh
case
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
the
sligh
case
your
honor
if
i
may
submit
is
a
case
--
is
a
health
and
safety
measure
which
seeks
to
prevent
the
use
of
citrus
fruits
unfit
for
consumption.
it
is
not
directed
to
the
question
which
has
been
raised
by
appellant
and
namely
the
protection
or
the
gaining
of
credit
for
good
fruit.
mr.
jacob
abramson
yes,
to
prevent
export
of
poor
fruit,
but
appellant
here
does
not
stress
this,
but
stresses
rather
the
credit
for
good
fruit.
we
have
indicated
also
that
the
appellant's
order
represents
the
reversal
of
long
time
practice.
he
states
before
this
court
that
he
was
wrong
all
these
years;
that
his
conduct
was
unlawful.
when
he
issued
the
order
to
appellant,
he
gave
no
reasons,
no
explanations.
at
no
time
has
he
stated
whether
there's
been
any
--
rather
his
conclusion
that
he
was
wrong
was
the
result
of
any
decision.
no
mention
of
any
such
thing,
but
he
says
he
was
wrong
--
had
even
properly
advised,
he
would
have
done
differently.
well,
we
have
the
state
of
california
same
situation.
the
state
of
california
has
never
raised
any
question
and
does
not
raise
one
at
this
time.
it
knows
of
this
litigation
and
has
not
sought
to
intervene
in
any
way.
in
conclusion
your
honor,
we
submit
that
in
making
this
three-fold
requirement
in
consequence
of
appellant's
order,
namely
that
the
packing
be
done
in
the
state
of
arizona,
that
this
be
done
in
a
packing
shed
in
arizona
and
that
the
appellee
construct
packing
facilities
in
arizona,
goes
far
beyond
and
anything
this
court
has
sanctioned
in
modern
time.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
the
prerogative
of
the
state
of
arizona
to
say
to
a
grower
you
must
construct
your
packing
plant
in
this
state.
this
is
an
economic
consideration
which
the
businessman
must
make
works
to
his
best
advantage
to
establish
his
facilities.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
fully
justified
both
on
the
law
and
the
facts
and
should
be
affirmed,
thank
you.
mr.
jacob
abramson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
learned
counsel
has
stated
that
the
dispositive
issue
in
this
case
is
the
purpose
of
the
arizona
law,
what
is
the
purpose?
it
is
already
been
made
clear
what
the
purpose
is,
and
this
is
to
achieve
credit
and
to
the
state
of
arizona
for
a
good
fruit.
the
concern
is
not
about
receiving
discredit
for
poor
fruit
because
in
this
case,
the
poor
fruit
is
going
to
be
packed
in
other
states.
it's
to
receive
credit
for
a
good
fruit.
now,
we
submit
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
mr.
chief
justice,
the
argument
of
appellant
is
that
parker
fruit
is
good
fruit
and
he
wants
it
to
be
labeled
as
good
fruit.
this
is
the
main
concern
and
his
argument.
he
states
this
repeatedly
that
it's
to
enhance
the
reputation
by
identifying
the
fruit
as
arizona
fruit.
the
point
i'm
getting
to
is
that
the
determining
question
here
is
not
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
arizona
law,
even
if
the
purpose
is
to
obtain
credit.
although,
this
court
has
never
gone
so
far
as
to
permit
what
the
appellant
seeks
to
do
here
in
furtherance
of
that
purpose,
even
to
achieve
credit
we
say
is
not
an
improper
purpose.
it's
fine
we
say
if
one
wants
to
do
a
good
job
and
to
get
credit
for
it,
but
that
is
not
the
issue.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
how
far
may
the
state
of
arizona
go
in
trying
to
achieve
this
purpose?
in
order
to
achieve
this
purpose,
the
state
of
arizona
through
the
interpretation
of
the
arizona
law
by
the
appellant
is
saying
three
things
must
occur.
one,
the
packing
must
be
done
in
arizona;
two,
the
packing
must
be
done
in
packing
shed
in
arizona
and
in
the
context
of
this
case
where
the
church
company
does
not
have
packing
facilities
at
parker
and
indeed,
cannot
have
such
facility
because
there
are
no
railroad
lines
going
in
there,
must
construct
packing
facilities
at
parker.
to
be
sure
appellant
states,
now
the
law
doesn't
in
terms
say
you
must
do
this
and
therefore,
we
can't
hear
you
to
complain,
but
this
is
the
necessary
effect
of
his
order
and
in
fact,
the
appellant
in
its
brief
expressly
states
this
that
this
is
the
dilemma
in
which
the
appellee
finds
itself
that
in
order
to
comply
with
the
order,
it
must
do
these
three
things.
now,
we
submit
that
this
goes
too
far
in
its
encroachment
upon
the
federal
concern
with
maintaining
a
free-flow
of
interstate
commerce.
we
submit
it's
contrary
to
decisions
of
this
court
which
we
have
cited;
the
shrimp
cases
to
which
learned
counsel
has
alluded
to
in
his
statement.
we
submit
that
this
is
the
real
issue;
how
far
may
the
state
of
arizona
go
in
obtaining
credit
for
a
good
fruit
or
even
keeping
out
poor
fruit?
there
has
been
no
case
cited
by
appellant
in
which
this
court
has
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
these
three
requirements
maybe
imposed.
mr.
jacob
abramson
your
honor,
the
sligh
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
the
sligh
case
involved
a
statute
which
stated
simply
that
citrus
fruits
unfit
for
consumption
shall
not
be
handled.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
question
of
intrastate
–
interstate.
it
was
purely
a
criminal
statute
and
imposed
a
penalty
for
the
handling
of
such
fruit.
the
sligh
case
would
have
been
a
case
similar
to
ours.
if
the
state
in
that
case
had
said
this
citrus
fruit
must
be
packed
in
this
state,
but
that
was
not
the
situation
in
the
sligh
case.
mention
has
been
made
of
the
pacific
box
case.
this
involved
a
law
of
the
state
of
oregon
which
established
certain
standard
containers
to
be
used
for
packing
in
that
state
of
raspberries
and
strawberries.
an
out
of
state
manufacture
of
containers
challenged
this
law
saying
i
want
to
come
into
oregon
and
sell
my
containers
in
oregon,
these
were
different
containers
from
those
provided
on
the
oregon
law,
and
this
court
held
that
oregon
may
within
its
right
prescribe
containers,
but
their
case
did
not
involve
the
situation
such
as
here.
if
oregon
statute
said
raspberries
and
strawberries
must
be
packed
in
oregon,
this
would
have
presented
before
this
court
the
same
issue
which
it
has
before
it
now.
this
court
has
stated
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
we
submit
that
the
pacific
states
decision
was
correct
your
honor
that
a
state
may
provide
that
where
commodities
are
packed
within
the
state
certain
containers
shall
be
used.
but
i
submit
again
mr.
chief
justice
burger
that
the
statute
in
the
pacific
states
box
case
did
not
state
that
the
packing,
the
processing
and
packing
of
raspberries
and
strawberries
shall
be
performed
in
the
state
of
oregon.
had
it
done
so,
it
would
have
presented
the
same
issue
which
we
have
here.
mr.
jacob
abramson
turner
against
maryland
--
i
think
this
case
gets
--
this
case
gets
closer.
this
was
an
1882
case.
counsel
for
western
growers
has
stated
with
reference
to
that
case
that
it's
cited
a
long
string
of
statutes.
these
were
statutes
in
a
colonial
times,
much
has
happened
since
1882,
advancements
in
transportation,
processing,
packing,
handling,
and
of
course
this
court
since
that
time
has
rendered
decisions
in
the
toomer
v.
witsell,
the
heidell
cases,
the
dean
milk
case,
and
i
think
we're
moving
with
the
times.
this
court
has
stated
on
numerous
occasions
that
it
will
be
guarded
by
practical
considerations.
mr.
justice
white
has
already
touched
upon
one
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
namely
that
the
problem
which
brings
us
before
this
court
is
one
which
exists
in
the
border
districts
which
joined
the
states
of
california
and
arizona;
that
is
to
say
the
districts
along
the
colorado
river.
here,
the
same
climatic
conditions
prevail.
climate,
weather
atmospheric
conditions
know
no
state
borders,
and
that
given
the
same
growing
conditions,
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
same
grower
to
have
growing
operations
on
both
sides
of
the
border.
now,
the
question
was
raised;
what
is
the
area
of
production?
it's
not
too
great
mr.
justice
white
because
the
crops
which
are
involved
are
of
such
a
highly
perishable
nature
that
they
must
be
taken
out
of
the
ground,
processed,
packed
and
put
in
cars
on
their
way
within
the
matter
of
just
a
few
hours.
so,
the
distance
does
not
--
you're
not
--
you
don't
have
the
possibility
of
dealing
in
large
distances,
i
would
say
a
radius
of
30
miles,
40
miles,
something
of
that
nature.
the
church
company
the
appellee
here
has
operations
on
both
sides
as
you
know.
it
has
operations
at
parker
under
a
lease
with
the
colorado
river,
indian
tribes.
this
is
a
distance
of
25
miles
from
the
border
and
has
been
doing
its
packing
at
blight
on
the
california
side,
5
miles
over
on
the
california
side.
mr.
jacob
abramson
yes,
on
the
blight
side
and
because
these
are
growers
who
don't
enjoy
federal
subsidies,
whose
production
cost
and
transportation
and
costs
are
among
the
highest
in
the
nation.
their
success
or
failure
depends
on
their
ability
to
be
efficient,
and
this
means
to
economize.
so,
if
a
grower
of
this
kind
requires
packing
facilities,
he
will
put
them
on
one
side
of
the
line
or
the
other
wherever
they
fit
in
with
his
operations.
he's
obviously
not
going
to
duplicate
his
facilities.
now,
the
same
situation
exists
at
yuma
on
the
arizona
side
and
at
bard
on
the
california.
these
are
just
opposite
to
one
another,
across
the
river,
the
short
distance
of
possibly
5
miles
and
for
years,
there
has
been
transport
of
cantaloupes
and
other
commodities
from
the
california
side
at
bard
over
to
yuma
on
the
arizona
side
where
they
been
processed
and
packed
just
as
these
cantaloupes
had
been
at
blight.
california
as
you
know
has
a
law
very
similar.
we
can
draw
fine
lines
about
particular
words
or
sentences.
but
basically,
they're
the
same.
there's
testimony
in
the
record
that
the
california
law
and
inspection,
if
anything
is
more
stringent
than
the
arizona
law,
but
we
need
not
to
make
an
issue
of
this.
in
any
event,
it's
been
going
on
from
bard
to
yuma
for
a
long
time.
california
has
never
raised
the
question.
they
had
never
attempted
to
stop
this
practice.
they
reconciled
it
with
their
law.
california,
the
state
of
california
knows
about
this
pending
litigation
and
it
has
not
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
the
california
mr.
justice
white
does
have
a
law
similar
to
that
of
arizona
which
requires
some
identification
on
the
container.
the
record
shows
that
in
this
particular
case
where
the
same
containers,
very
same
containers
are
used
both
where
packing
is
done
in
arizona
and
in
california
has
imprinted
upon
it
packed
in
season
in
arizona
and
california,
main
office
salinas,
california.
this
is
where
the
main
office
of
the
church
company.
mr.
jacob
abramson
packed
in
season
in
arizona
and
california.
mr.
jacob
abramson
that's
our
trade,
yes.
mr.
jacob
abramson
this
is
what
appears
on
the
crate,
packed
and
seasoned
in
arizona
and
california
indicates
that
packing
may
go
one
in
each
state.
this
brings
me
to
another
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
in
response
to
this
point
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
i
should
explain
how
these
cantaloupes
are
marketed.
some
question
has
been
raised,
i
think
possibly
by
the
chief
justice
as
to
whether
these
commodities
are
identified
at
the
store
level,
but
they
are
not.
these
cantaloupes
are
sold
by
the
growers
to
a
small
group
of
buyers
who
are
present
right
there
on
the
spot.
they're
there
everyday,
they
are
their
representatives.
they
are
at
the
point
of
production,
whether
it's
the
packing
shed
or
field,
they're
inspecting
the
produce.
they
know
exactly
where
it's
been
grown.
they
know
who
the
grower
is.
they
know
the
quality
or
they
wouldn't
be
buying
it.
they're
there
to
inspect
the
quality.
mr.
jacob
abramson
these
are
wholesale
jobbers.
they're
distributors,
receivers,
but
who
have
their
representative's
right
there
on
the
spot
and
they
move
from
place
to
place
as
the
harvest
progresses.
mr.
jacob
abramson
their
customers
are
in
turn
are
receivers,
the
car
lot
receivers
all
over
the
country
who
receive
these
in
car
lots.
the
sales
are
in
car
lots
or
truckloads.
you
see,
they
are
not
sold
as
individual
packages.
and
eventually,
when
they
reach
their
terminus,
terminal
points
throughout
the
nation,
the
distributors
will
then
distribute
them
among
the
chain
stores
possibly,
among
retail
stores,
but
once
they
reach
the
store,
they're
taken
out
of
the
package
and
put
on
a
shelf.
the
housewife
doesn't
know
where
this
cantaloupe
has
come
from.
if
she
likes,
if
it
tastes
good,
she
will
come
back
and
buy
it.
so,
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
yes
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
the
sligh
case
--
mr.
jacob
abramson
the
sligh
case
your
honor
if
i
may
submit
is
a
case
--
is
a
health
and
safety
measure
which
seeks
to
prevent
the
use
of
citrus
fruits
unfit
for
consumption.
it
is
not
directed
to
the
question
which
has
been
raised
by
appellant
and
namely
the
protection
or
the
gaining
of
credit
for
good
fruit.
mr.
jacob
abramson
yes,
to
prevent
export
of
poor
fruit,
but
appellant
here
does
not
stress
this,
but
stresses
rather
the
credit
for
good
fruit.
we
have
indicated
also
that
the
appellant's
order
represents
the
reversal
of
long
time
practice.
he
states
before
this
court
that
he
was
wrong
all
these
years;
that
his
conduct
was
unlawful.
when
he
issued
the
order
to
appellant,
he
gave
no
reasons,
no
explanations.
at
no
time
has
he
stated
whether
there's
been
any
--
rather
his
conclusion
that
he
was
wrong
was
the
result
of
any
decision.
no
mention
of
any
such
thing,
but
he
says
he
was
wrong
--
had
even
properly
advised,
he
would
have
done
differently.
well,
we
have
the
state
of
california
same
situation.
the
state
of
california
has
never
raised
any
question
and
does
not
raise
one
at
this
time.
it
knows
of
this
litigation
and
has
not
sought
to
intervene
in
any
way.
in
conclusion
your
honor,
we
submit
that
in
making
this
three-fold
requirement
in
consequence
of
appellant's
order,
namely
that
the
packing
be
done
in
the
state
of
arizona,
that
this
be
done
in
a
packing
shed
in
arizona
and
that
the
appellee
construct
packing
facilities
in
arizona,
goes
far
beyond
and
anything
this
court
has
sanctioned
in
modern
time.
we
submit
that
it
is
not
the
prerogative
of
the
state
of
arizona
to
say
to
a
grower
you
must
construct
your
packing
plant
in
this
state.
this
is
an
economic
consideration
which
the
businessman
must
make
works
to
his
best
advantage
to
establish
his
facilities.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
below
was
fully
justified
both
on
the
law
and
the
facts
and
should
be
affirmed,
thank
you.
