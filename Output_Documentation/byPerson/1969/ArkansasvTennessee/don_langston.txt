mr.
don
langston
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
don
langston
this
is
an
original
action
brought
by
the
state
of
arkansas
against
the
state
of
tennessee
under
constitutional
provision
for
original
actions
boundary
disputes
between
states.
the
case

on
a
motion,
or

complaint,
statement
and
support
of
the
motion
and
complaint
filed
by
the
state
of
arkansas
against
the
state
of
tennessee.
the
court
accepted
the
case
and
appointed
a
senior
district
judge
from
the
state
of
minnesota,
the
hon.
gunnar
nordbye
to
set
as
a
special
master
in
this
case,
a
hearing
was
held
in
memphis,
tennessee
in
august
and
september
of
1968.
the
master
entered
its
report
finding
against
the
interest
of
the
state
of
arkansas
and
the
case
now
comes
before
this
court
on
exceptions
filed
by
the
state
of
arkansas
to
that
report
and
our
brief
in
support
thereof.
as
a
preliminary
statement
concerning
this
case,
when
this
case
came
to
the
attention
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
we
hired
a
special
counsel,
george
cracraft
of
helena
who
is
a
specialist
in
this
type
of
field
concerning
river
boundaries.
in
arkansas,
there
are
a
few
specialist
in
this
and
we
felt
that
he
was
specially
qualified
to
handle
this
case.
however,
after
the
case
was
tried
and
it
was
briefed
to
the
master,
mr.
cracraft
was
elected
as
a
chancery
judge
in
1968
and
began
his
term
in
august
of
1969.
we
felt
that
mr.
cracraft
would
handle
this
case
for
us
here
before
this
court
but
we
discovered
a
constitutional
provision
in
arkansas,
which
is
article
7
section
25,
which
prohibit
our
judges
to
practice
in
lo
and
behold
state
and
federal
courts.
the
area
--
to
move
on,
the
area
in
controversy
between
the
states
of
arkansas
and
tennessee
comprised
some
5,000
acres
and
lies
physically
on
the
west
bank
or
the
arkansas
side
of
the
main
channel,
and
according
to
all
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
before
the
master,
it
has
been
there
for
at
least
--
as
long
as
any
witness
who
was
presented
could
recall.
when
the
matter
came
to
the
attention
of
the
state
of
arkansas
upon
the
complain
of
its
citizens
who
lived
in
crittenden
county
adjacent
to
this
area
and
who
had
sensed
the
memory
of
any
particular
witness,
these
citizens
had
been
in
possession
and
control
of
it
to
the
full
extent
of
which
the
land
was
capable
of
possession.
these
people
had
at
various
times
and
places
who
made
the
crops,
engaged
in
husbandry
of
other
sorts
of
raising
cattle,
hogs
and
horses
on
the
property,
and
at
from
time
to
time
severed,
cut
and
removed
valuable
timber
from
the
land
assessing
this
land
and
paying
severance
taxes
to
the
state
of
arkansas
and
--
mr.
don
langston
no
your
honor.
there
had
been
some
but
they
have
long
since
been
removed.
mr.
don
langston
close
to
half
million
dollars,
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
it
can
be
farmed
with
row
crops
and
it
has
very
much
timber
on
it
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
just
hardwood
timber
and
things
of
that
nature
that
will
grow
and
low
type
areas
of
the
alluvial
valley
of
the
mississippi
river.
mr.
don
langston
parts
of
it
are
being
farmed
as
crops.
it
has
been
used
for
crops
and
so
it
remains
in
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
don
langston
it's
attached
to
the
arkansas
side
of
the
river.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
there
is
a
marked
area
along
there,
but
the
area
of
photograph,
which
is
located
in
the
back
of
the
state
of
tennessee
is
free
which
is
on
a
11
appendix
a
6
will
show
that
it
is
--
this
is
a
1929
map
and
the
attachment
to
the
state
of
arkansas
is
even
more
now
than
it
was
in
that
particular
time.
the
only
--
mr.
don
langston
there
are
trees
and
vegetation
and
things
that
do
connect
it
to
the
state
of
arkansas,
which
have
been
filled
in
by
sediment
and
it
is
attached
to
the
state
of
arkansas.
the
portion
how
watery
--
would
some
of
--
would
be
separated
from
the
state
of
it.
from
the
state
of
arkansas,
we
contend
that
it
is
attached
to
our
--
physically
to
our
state.
mr.
don
langston
close
to
five
--
mr.
don
langston
5,000
acres.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
believe
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
they
have
been
--
we
contended
that
they
had
been
paid
in
state
of
arkansas
your
honor,
and
that
the
private
citizens
had
conveyed
consistent
with
the
state
of
arkansas
and
that
no
one
from
the
state
of
tennessee
had
ever
been
on
it
and
that
our
people
had
been
on
it,
had
farmed
it,
paid
taxes
on
it,
conveyed
it
in
accordance
of
the
law
–-
mr.
don
langston
state
of
arkansas
citizens
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
there
was
at
one
time
citizens
--
mr.
don
langston
there
worked
one
time
i
think
a
man
by
the
name
of
paget
who
lived
out
there,
but
most
of
all,
it
was
mostly
people
who
had
adjoining
lands
on
arkansas
that
extended
their
lands
on
that
into
this
particular
area.
mr.
don
langston
on
the
part
of
the
acquiescence
of
our
people
being
out
there
and
he
found
against
the
state
of
arkansas,
we
also
placed
evidence
in
the
record
that
we
built
--
that
the
crittenden
county,
arkansas
built
roads
and
our
game
and
fish
commission
patrol
the
area
for
game
laws
and
that
our
officers
--
police
officers
police
the
area.
as
early
as
1933,
according
to
the
record
in
this
case,
some
litigation
was
conducted
with
regard
to
this
land
in
the
courts
of
tennessee
and
various
claims
were
made
by
the
citizens
of
tennessee
to
the
lands
from
that
date.
however,
the
record
we
think
clearly
reflects
that
no
claimant
of
the
state
of
tennessee
has
ever
put
foot
on
this
ground
and
not
tilt
or
cut
and
remove
any
timber
from
the
land.
we
believe
that
if
counsel
for
tennessee
would
be
completely
candid
with
the
court,
they
would
admit
such
claims
of
citizens
of
tennessee
have
ever
made
the
property
to
the
date
of
this
hearing
have
been
paper
claims
only
and
that
the
only
actual
physical
occupation
of
the
area
has
been
accomplished
by
citizens
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
we
believe
that
the
record
is
also
silent
to
anything
that
the
state
of
tennessee
as
a
sovereign
has
ever
done
to
improve
either
the
value
or
the
use
of
this
area.
so,
for
this
background
in
mind,
the
officials
of
crittenden
county,
the
county
judge,
tax
assessor
and
other
officials
over
in
crittenden
county
prevailed
on
the
attorney
general
and
prevailed
upon
the
governor
of
arkansas
to
request
the
attorney
general
to
bring
this
suit
in
the
name
of
the
state
of
arkansas
to
determine
who
owned
this
property.
on
the
whole
case,
the
master
found
the
fact
of
acquiescence
which
is
our
--
the
citizens
of
arkansas
being
on
the
land,
he
found
this
in
favor
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
and
as
we
understand
the
function
of
the
master
who
was
appointed
by
this
court,
these
findings
are
not
to
be
set
aside
lightly
or
if
there's
any
basis
in
evidence
at
all,
this
court
will
sustain
them.
we
cannot
seriously
urge
that
in
this
--
these
exceptions
to
this
court
to
set
aside
those
findings.
and
the
state
of
arkansas
second,
form
a
position,
is
that
even
though
we
haven't
acquired
the
ownership
of
all
this
area
by
the
acquiescence
power,
the
exercise
complaint
dominion
and
control
over
it
for
a
long
period
of
time,
that
certainly
a
smaller
portion
of
the
area,
then
that
claim
by
the
state
of
tennessee
was
actually
part
of
its
domain
originally.
the
exception
which
we
do
urge
is
not
a
factual
one
but
is
one
of
law
and
the
position
of
the
state
of
arkansas
in
these
exceptions
is
that
even
if
the
basic
facts
as
found
by
the
master
are
true,
he
applied
the
incorrect
rule
of
law
to
the
facts
in
the
local
state
line.
that
brings
us
to
the
first
argued
point
in
our
brief,
which
is
that
the
master
erred
in
concluding
that
the
boundary
continued
to
move
as
long
as
the
abandoned
channel
float
during
high
water.
in
this
argument
on
page
8
of
our
written
brief,
the
rule
is
adopted
by
the
master,
which
he
felt
was
controlling
and
i
think
both
sides
agree,
which
is
based
on
a
decision
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee
to
the
effect
that
though
the
main
channel
is
a
movable
one
and
the
channel
of
navigation
in
a
navigable
stream,
that
after
an
avulsion
and
as
a
result
of
an
avulsion,
the
change
in
boundary
is
not
affected.
the
case
rules
as
stated
on
page
8,
the
effect
of
an
avulsion
is
not
complete
until
it
stagnates
and
ceases
to
run
and
as
long
as
the
channel
remains
a
running
stream,
the
boundary
marked
by
it
may
be
moved
by
an
erosion.
but
we
contend
that
when
stagnation
occurs,
the
process
then
is
at
an
end.
we
quote
from
that
case,
the
boundary
then
becomes
fixed
in
the
middle
of
the
channel,
as
this
court
has
defined
it
and
the
gradual
filling
up
of
the
bad
that
ensues
is
not
to
be
treated
as
accretion
to
the
shores
but
as
an
ultimate
effect
of
the
avulsion.
now
the
master
in
his
report
while
he
did
recognize
this
rule
and
quoted
it
in
his
report,
has
very
clearly,
erroneously
applied
the
rule
in
the
same
manner
that
tennessee's
principal
witness,
mr.
rodgers
misapplied
it
in
the
quoted
testimony
on
page
9
of
our
article.
mr.
rodgers
states
that
his
entire
report
as
to
the
location
of
the
land
between
the
two
states
and
the
matter
is
based
upon
the
application
of
the
rule
that
we
--
that
i
just
recited.
when
the
water
stagnates
at
ordinary
high
water
and
when
it
ceases
to
run
at
ordinary
high
water,
instead
of
the
low
water.
he
also
admitted
in
the
same
quoted
testimony
that
he
did
not
know
and
made
no
attempt
to
establish
a
line
along
that
area
where
the
water
stagnated
at
low
water.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
we
feel
that
he
followed
the
tennessee
witness
rodgers
testimony
to
the
letter
in
finding
this,
we
feel
that
in
the
old
abandoned
channel
that
the
master
never
did
find
when
the
water
stagnated
at
low
--
at
low
water
which
we
claim
that
this
court
has
said
he
must
do.
he
did
contend
that
he
followed
that
rule
but
he
couldn't
held
because
he
followed
the
testimony
of
rodgers
who
never
did
set
the
time
that
the
water
first
stagnated
and
the
land
became
fixed.
mr.
rodgers
kept
saying
that
every
time
high
water
would
come
in,
it
would
erode
a
way
and
move
the
boundary
and
he
kept
accreting
into
the
arkansas
shore
and
the
master
adopted
--
the
master
adopted
mr.
rodgers'
testimony
that
the
boundary
keeps
moving
every
--
and
the
old,
abandoned
channel
keeps
moving
every
time
the
high
water
comes
in
and
there's
some
more
erosion.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor,
if
he's
correct
in
saying
that
if
he
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
boundary
does
not
become
fixed
when
the
water
first
stagnates
and
doesn't
move,
then
the
state
of
arkansas
doesn't
have
a
case,
but
if
the
rule
is
that
the
water
first
time
it
stagnates
which
we
contend
it
did
in
about
1917,
or
1918,
then
his
report
is
erroneous.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
unless
the
river
came
back
cut
all
the
way
passed
the
old
dead
thalweg.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
right.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
and
high
water.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
the
master's
contention
and
then
it's
our
contention
and
once
the
water
is
stagnating,
the
dead
thalweg
became
the
fixed
boundary.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
tennessee
would
have
an
enclave
that
in
accordance
with
our
engineer's
exhibit,
would
have
an
enclave
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
mr.
don
langston
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
we
talked
about
this,
i'm
not
sure
what
--
that
this
court
could
enter
judgment
on
it
or
whether
it
would
have
to
be
sent
back
for
additional
--
for
a
commissioner
or
someone
to
set
that
your
honor.
we've
discussed
that
and
in
my
notes
here,
i
have
either
this
court
should
do
it
or
send
it
back.
mr.
don
langston
our
engineer
mr.
smith
did
plan
out
the
property
by
geodetic
positions
on
one
of
our
exhibits
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
well,
it
couldn't
be
until
after
1955.
mr.
don
langston
a
couple
of
years
after
1915
or
16.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
that
--
that's
exactly
our
position
that
he
should
have
found
that
--
that
he
should
have
found
that
the
old
channel
died
and
--
it's
our
position
that
mr.
rodgers
also
admitted
in
the
same
quoted
testimony
that
he
did
not
know
and
made
no
attempt
to
establish
a
line
along
the
area
where
the
water
stagnated
at
low
water.
the
master
in
adopting
the
rodgers'
report
completely
erred
in
fixing
the
state
line
in
exactly
the
same
place
rodgers
did,
he
has
applied
the
same
rule,
that
is
that
the
line
becomes
fixed
only
if
the
water
does
not
run
through
the
old
channel
at
ordinary
high
water
stages.
this
is
the
ruling
that
even
though
if
might
stagnate
and
not
run
and
even
sustain
vegistation
at
low
water
time.
when
the
water
is
high
the
water
comes
up
to
again
to
ordinary
high
water,
the
land
again
becomes
fluid
and
it
moves
with
the
scarring
effect
of
high
water
flow.
that's
more
along
the
line
of
what
mr.
justice
white
was
asking.
we
insist
here
that
this
cannot
be
what
this
court
intended
in
its
prior
decisions
or
that
it
intended
for
these
old
avulsions
or
could
all
should
remain
in
dispute
and
flew
it
for
many
years.
the
only
other
witness
who
testified
to
these
matters
was
alston
smith
whose
qualifications
were
set
forth
in
the
transcript
to
the
record
on
pages
40
to
47
who
has
testified
in
many
matters
involving
state
lines
over
a
hundred
in
number.
i
think
he
has
participated
in
some
16
of
these
cutoffs
such
as
this
and
whose
opinion
has
been
accepted
by
this
court
on
at
least
two
recent
occasions
which
i
referred
to
in
our
brief.
it
was
a
testimony
of
our
witness,
the
state
of
arkansas
witness
that
his
training
and
experience
indicated
clearly
that
in
a
cutoff
of
this
kind,
stagnation
would
occur
immediately
and
within
two
or
three
years.
there
are
no
maps
or
data
available
as
to
when
stagnation
occurred
but
his
experience
in
these
cutoffs
and
call
upon
his
training
being
with
the
mississippi
river
commission
for
35
years
and
charge
navigation
enraging
that
stagnation
would
occur
within
two
years
from
1915
to
16
when
the
cutoff
became
complete.
in
quotations
from
the
record
set
forth
on
page
12
of
our
argument
mr.
smith
indicates
that
within
a
couple
of
years
the
land
would
stagnate
and
become
sedimented
and
that
low
water
would
have
no
flow.
the
state
of
tennessee
has
criticized
or
has
taken
the
state
of
arkansas
to
task
in
its
brief
concerning
that
we
say
that
alston
smith
gave
the
only
competent
testimony
in
this
case.
we
don't
except
--
what
we
mean
by
competent
evidence
is
that
rogers
base
his
entire
report
on
a
--
an
improper
premise,
that
what
makes
his
testimony
incompetent
that
he
didn't
found
when
the
water
first
stagnated
but
that
he
said
that
ground
remain
fluid
when
water
flowed
through
that
ordinary
high
water.
that's
the
reason
why
we
contend
that
he
is
testimony
concerning
--
that
is
incompetent
because
he
based
it
on
the
false
premise.
as
for
our
second
argument
--
mr.
don
langston
now,
the
state
of
tennessee
says
if
the
master
never
did
find
that
but
i
think
from
your
conclusions
--
from
the
conclusions
that
from
that
you've
got
to
say
that
and
that
he
did
by
not
saying
if
he
did
say
that
because
the
map
that
he
attaches
to
his
report
follows
the
line
by
rogers
and
that
was
rogers'
testimony
and
they
couldn't
--
there
couldn't
be
any
other
way
he
abridged
it.
mr.
don
langston
the
exceptions.
mr.
don
langston
excuse
me
it's
attached
to
the
master's
report,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
don
langston
that's
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
roger
said
he
didn't
know,
our
witness
said
it
occurred
in
two
years
after
1915,
16
and
roger's
only
testimony
was
--
mr.
don
langston
it
was
on
rogers'
testimony.
mr.
don
langston
he
said
that
he
had
seen
a
foot
of
water
there
even
after
1955.
so
that
means
that
he
never
did
actually.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
master's
report
is
still
going
to
allow
this
land
to
move
if
it
--
an
ordinary
high
water
if
it
moves
into
the
state
of
arkansas.
it's
still
fluid
under
master's
conclusion.
mr.
don
langston
that's
the
only
conclusion
you
can
come
to
you
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
there
is
difference,
yes
your
honor.
we
feel
that
he
would
let
the
line
move
at
ordinary
high
water
and
also
that
the
flood
water
would
also
be
involved
too.
so
we
think
that
he
has
never
fixed
actually
--
of
course
--
he
has
fixed
it
but
still
under
his
theory
it
still
fluid.
mr.
don
langston
roger
said
he
didn't
know.
that's
quoted
in
our
brief
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
at
ordinary
high
water.
so
he
is
saying
that
the
water
never
has
stagnated.
mr.
don
langston
he
never
says
that's
the
reason
when
we
say
his
testimony
is
incompetent.
mr.
don
langston
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
if
it
would
be
--
if
it
calls
some
incretion
it
would
still
be
making
the
boundary
fluid.
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
the
state
of
tennessee
says
at
3.1
on
the
memphis
gauge,
it
was
our
contention
that
it
would
be
at
zero
at
memphis
gauge,
that
it
would
stagnant
but
we
will
accept
the
state
of
tennessee's
contention.
mr.
don
langston
that
it
would
be
enough
probably
to
call
some
accretions.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
think
there's
any
testimony
on
that
your
honor.
i
don't
recall.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
really,
your
honor,
i
just
don't
remember
on
that
point
your
honor.
the
next
point
that
we
attempt
to
make
in
our
new
exemptions
is
really
based
on
our
first
contention
that
if
the
court
does
not
hold
from
state
of
arkansas
on
his
first
contention
then
the
second
contention
is
also
out.
that
second
contention
is
that
the
master
erred
in
extending
the
tennessee
lands
laterally
down
the
stream
so
as
to
deny
arkansas
access
to
navigable
channel.
the
2845
of
the
state
of
arkansas
is
attempting
to
develop
here,
is
that
state
lines
are
supposed
to
be
permanent
and
supposed
to
be
fixed
and
suppose
to
be
known
and
that
this
court
didn't
intend
for
them
remain
fluid
and
movable
after
one
of
these
avulsions
indefinitely.
we
are
saying
that
this
court
wants
after
an
avulsion
they
want
to
--
it
wants
the
state
line
to
be
set
and
not
be
moving
and
be
fluid
in
depth.
that
when
this
court
indicated
that
it
was
to
become
fixed
at
stagnation,
it
meant
as
soon
as
stagnation
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
an
exception
to
the
rule
rather
than
the
rule
and
these
exceptions
should
not
be
permitted
to
overwrite
the
rule
itself.
we
think
the
whole
idea
is
to
fix
the
boundary
and
to
get
it
fixed
as
soon
as
possible,
well
at
the
same
time
preserve
whatever
rights
either
party
might
have
and
might
have
lost
as
a
result
of
the
avulsion.
it
is
not
a
cure
all
but
simply
something
to
preserve
as
near
as
possible
the
rights
of
either
party.
on
this
point
we
simply
take
the
position
that
the
master's
finding
of
fact
kept
the
old
channel
open
too
long,
should
have
sedimented
in
smith's
scar,
as
our
witness
smith
did
it.
within
a
few
years
there
after
it
was
low
water
time
and
movement
that
it
made
after
that
period
would
have
no
effect
on
the
boundary
because
the
boundary
became
fixed.
we
emphasize
that
when
the
stagnation
occurred,
the
old
thalweg
no
longer
existed,
it
was
dead.
the
new
channel
of
the
river
was
then
the
live
thalweg
and
above
and
below
its
point
of
intersection
was
a
dead
thalweg,
the
live
thalweg
became
movable.
we
also
have
emphasize
the
point
that
this
court
should
not
permit
the
dead
thalweg
which
is
not
alive,
which
has
no
life
to
override
and
control
the
live
point.
this
is
all
tied
in
with
our
argument
which
is
beginning
on
page
14
of
our
brief.
the
cases
seem
to
hold
very
clearly
that
you
can
extend
these
formations
upstream
and
downstream
so
far
as
to
cut
off
access
and
navigation.
this
is
historical
and
has
always
run
through
our
law
as
the
right
of
access
that
seems
to
give
rise
to
this
root.
we
don't
want
this
court
to
cut
--
to
allow
the
state
of
tennessee
to
cut
off
the
state
of
arkansas
access
to
the
river
for
some
two
miles
upstream
and
four
miles
downstream
from
the
dead
thalweg.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor
of
course
the
federal
government
has
pretty
much
taken
over
navigation
on
these
rivers
but
we
feel
that
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you
is
we
thought
this
out
when
we
were
studying
this
case
that
it's
sort
of
historical
and
the
access
to
the
river
is
a
right
of
property
and
should
not
be
dealt
with
lively
and
it
should
--
mr.
don
langston
well,
we
think
the
old
state
has
access
there
too
your
honor.
we
don't
have
any
plans
to
develop
a
report
or
anything
if
it
would
answer
your
question.
mr.
don
langston
well
the
state
of
arkansas
owns
to
the
bed
of
the
stream
your
honor
and
it
could
--
mr.
don
langston
in
arkansas
your
honor,
the
private
owners
own
only
to
the
high
water
mark
and
the
state
of
arkansas
owns
from
the
high
watermark
to
the
bed
of
the
stream.
mr.
don
langston
what
argument
is
that
your
honor?
mr.
don
langston
yes.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor,
that
was
the
gist
of
cross
of
examination
of
witness
rogers
that's
set
forth
in
our
brief
is
that
he
never
did
to
fix
the
time
when
they
–
well
are
you
talking
about
the
access?
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor
we
said
that
the
land
should
not
be
extended
down
stream
from
the
dead
thalweg
or
up
stream
from
it.
we
did
make
this
argument.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
he
gives
it
to
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
i
don't
believe,
i
don't
know
what
they
did
or
not
but
he
gives
it
to
the
state
of
tennessee
on
leisure
of
rogers
testimony.
i'm
advised
by
the
social
counsel
that
he
did
not.
mr.
don
langston
i
really
don't
know
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
did
advance
it
but
may
be
not
as
vehemently
as
we
have
here.
i
believe
that
would
be
better
for
my
position.
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
it
would
your
honor
because
the
thalweg
would
have
been
moving
each
time
and
under
the
master's
theory,
it
would
been
moving
downstream
and
upstream.
the
master
found
that
the
old
thalweg
did
not
die,
that
it
is
still
fluid
and
moves
in
ordinary
high
water,
that's
our
contention.
so
every
time
there's
an
erosion
or
something,
that
moves
the
what
we
call
the
dead
thalweg
so
to
prevail
on
your
point
that
is
prevailed
under
the
your
second
point,
you
must
prevail
on
the
first.
we
say
that
the
thalweg
cutoff
here
and
on
this
downstream
is
our
and
all
the
upstream
is
our
but
i
ask
the
--
mr.
don
langston
we
sort
of
had
it
tied
in
with
our
first
point
but
i
do
see
what
you're
talking
about
i
believe
and
maybe
it's
not
tied
in
as
much
with
the
second
point
as
in
with
the
first
point
as
i
thought
it
was.
we
were
mostly
relying
on
the
brootes
(ph)
case
on
this
particular
argument
but
we
will
take
that
land
anyway
we
can
get
it.[laughter]
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
then
--
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
i
will
have
to
hurry.
your
honor
before
i
get
away
from
this
early
period
of
time,
in
our
brief
i
have
put
a
very
small
picture
here
of
a
1921
map.
this
is
at
appendix
a
5.
mr.
don
langston
the
reply
brief.
mr.
don
langston
thank
you
your
honor.
i
suppose
that
the
man
from
tennessee
probably
got
the
mule
over
there
for
crossing
the
memphis
arkansas
bridge
and
came
to
arkansas
in
crittenden
county
and
came
down
to
the
property
from
there.
mr.
don
langston
this
would
have
been
the
memphis
arkansas
bridge
up
the
river.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor
it's
a
--
we
can't
claim
it
was
passable
by
just
own
foot
that
the
channel
--
most
the
--
a
lot
of
channel
--
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor,
the
channel
dried
up.
the
course
of
the
channel
dried
up
and
trees
and
sediment
field
in
there
where
you
can
cross
it
by
foot
or
anyway,
by
vehicle,
wagon
or
anything.
i
think
that
the
exhibit
--
mr.
don
langston
at
one
time
there
was
a
house
owner
your
honor
i
think
in
that.
mr.
don
langston
pretty
primitive,
if
i
remember.
mr.
don
langston
it
is
in
the
record
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
1929
map
in
which
appendix
a
6
to
their
brief
shows
that
there's
at
back
of
course
1929
i
don't
know
what
state
of
the
river
this
was
but
there
is
sediment
in
this
from
the
old
channel.
some
along
in
here
and
some
have
been
here.
so
you
can
cross
from
arkansas
on
this
by
foot
or
by
vehicle.
mr.
don
langston
you
can
go
by
mule
and
wagon.
the
state
of
tennessee
in
their
brief
and
in
their
argument
here
has
taken
arkansas
to
task
because
of
its
pleadings
in
this
particular
case.
when
we
did
draft
our
pleadings,
we
did
allege
that
there
was
no
avulsion.
this
was
based
on
testimony
and
this
was
based
on
what
we
felt
was
the
case
but
whenever
our
engineer
got
in
to
it,
we
found
out
that
we
could
not
take
the
position
that
there
had
not
been
some
sort
of
an
avulsion
here.
they
say
that
smith,
our
expert
changed
his
testimony,
i
think
that
i
can
explain
to
the
court
why
his
testimony
was
changed.
whenever
he
first
started
testifying
concerning
this
in
private
litigation,
he
took
the
position
that
there
had
been
no
avulsion
and
the
reason
why
he
did
this
was
that
at
that
time
alone
in
this
particular
area
had
not
become
definite
or
crystallized
and
was
not
certain.
smith
took
the
position
around
15
years
ago
that
this
--
what
they
call
a
middle
bar
or
mud
bar
that
became
this
part
would
--
did
not
have
any
vegetation
on
it
and
that
low
water
was
the
only
time
that
it
came
up
as
sand
and
mud,
he
took
the
position
and
the
law
was
not
clear
that
that
changes
on
each
side
of
that
particular
thing
would
not
be
an
avulsion
or
would
not
move
the
thalweg
or
the
river
but
a
case
from
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
was
certiorari
was
denied
up
here
and
which
is
211
uhlhorn
versus
us
gypsum
company
366
f.2d.
211
certiorari
denied
here
385
us
1026
said
that
yes
whenever
the
avultive
part
was
you
could
see
it
at
low
water
that
changes
on
each
side
of
that
would
result
in
an
avulsion,
that
is
the
reason
why
his
testimony
was
changed
from
the
time
we
plead
and
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
and
we
do
not
think
that
his
position
is
inconsistent,
he
was
just
instructed
to
take
this
case
into
consideration
by
our
attorneys
--
by
the
state's
attorneys
whenever
he
formed
his
report
and
he
had
to
follow
the
yula
horn
decision
and
saying
yes
there
was
an
avulsion
but
he
did
say
that
he
wasn't
sure
that
there
really
was
but
he
was
going
to
give
the
state
of
tennessee
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
say,
“yes
there
was
a
small
avulsion
still
remain
there
due
to
the
master's
and
pilot's
report
of
the
middle
bar
or
a
mud
bar.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
severance
taxes
maybe
all
for
timber
and
few
things
like
that
but
i
don't
think
that
taxes
would
be
very
much.
but
it
has
so
list
as
the
record
reflects
has
sold
these
lands
for
taxes
over
there
in
arkansas.
that's
how
the
arkansas
--
the
land
has
sold
in
arkansas.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
it
has
sold
tax
that
has
been
forfeited
for
taxes
and
it
forfeits
to
the
state
and
then
the
state
to
its
land
commissioner
gives
tax
deeds
so
it
has
derived
some
revenue
from
it.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i'm
advised
that
someone
asked
that
there
was
--
how
much
forming
land
there
was
on,
there's
approximately
500
acres
that
can
be
farmed
there
now.
mr.
don
langston
out
of
5,000
most
of
this
timber
land.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
they're
doing.
mr.
don
langston
that's
what
our
citizens
are
doing.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
we
have
formed
that
all
along
our
citizens
have.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
wouldn't
think
so,
of
course
here
the
river
would
make
it
too
feasible
but
you
could
own
some
on
both
sides.
i
think
mr.
sutton
in
his
--
when
he
was
being
questioned
by
mr.
justice
white
clearly
shows
the
arkansas
position
is
the
one
that
should
be
accepted
by
this
court.
the
prior
case
of
arkansas
versus
tennessee
says
that
when
the
strange
stagnates
and
ceases
to
flow
and
it
smells
bad
and
that's
when
the
land
is
set
that
any
accretions
or
any
erosion
or
accretion
is
a
natural
result
of
that
avulsion.
mr.
sutton
wants
these
accretions
and
erosions
to
keep
moving
this
line
even
though
it's
not
the
channel
anymore.
he
wants
that
the
case
of
tennessee
versus
arkansas
says
that
these
erosions
and
accretions
are
--
and
sedimentations
is
a
natural
result
of
the
dying
of
the
old
thalweg.
that's
why
this
court
has
to
decide
when
and
where
the
old
thalweg
died
because
if
it
keeps
eroding
and
keeps
accreting,
it's
really
not
dead
and
it
keeps
moving
and
its
fluid
which
is
what
this
court
does
in
its
prior
decision
seems
to
say
it
does
want
to
do,
it
wants
to
have
the
old
dead
thalweg
inactive
and
then
let
the
new
one
control
the
lands.
mr.
don
langston
he
still
says
it's
a
--
he
says
--
but
the
accretions
that
attached
to
it
and
the
erosions
that
are
attached
to
it
will
move
the
state
line
if
he
says
--
his
position
is
that
it
has
done
it
though
--
mr.
don
langston
we
don't
agree
where
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
right.
he
claim
--
the
state
of
tennessee
claims
that
these
accretions
and
erosions
have
moved
--
we
claim
it's
in,
what
they
term
is
smith
scar.
mr.
don
langston
that's
not
our
position
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
the
accretions
built
down
from
the
arkansas
shore
and
attached
to
this
evolved
there.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
yes.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
we
claim
that
the
thalweg
died
at
around
1918
in
that
particular
point
and
it
could
not
move
any
further.
mr.
don
langston
any
movement
of
it
would
--
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor
it's
our
position
that
this
evolved
area
keep
eroding
away
and
got
to
where
smith
scar
was
whenever
the
thalweg
died.
the
important
thing
here,
we
think
the
court
to
decide
is
when
and
where
this
thalweg
died
set
the
boundary
line
there
in
a
definite
place
and
a
portion
of
these
lands
and
accordance
there
with.
we
either
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
fact
that
reversed
the
conclusions
of
the
master
and
inner
findings
and
inconsistency
with
our
position
or
to
send
that
matter
back
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
we
filed
this
lawsuit
on
the
basis
of
request
from
officials
of
crittenden
county
who
were
prevailed
upon
by
the
private
citizens
who
were
involved
there.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
it
is
your
honor
and
the
county
officials
prevailed
upon
the
governor
to
request
the
attorney
general
to
file
the
lawsuit.
it
originates
from
these
private
persons
who
were
involved
in
litigation
tennessee
the
private
arkansas
persons
who
claim
the
land.
mr.
don
langston
we
have
took
the
position
that
the
tennessee
litigation
which
decided
the
issue
in
favor
of
the
tennessee
people
would
preclude
our
arkansas
residents
of
filing
anything
in
the
state
court
of
arkansas.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
i
don't
know
but
since
we've
been
losing
this
case
we're
probably
happy
to
do
that.
mr.
don
langston
i
suppose
it
would
your
honor,
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
don
langston
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
don
langston
this
is
an
original
action
brought
by
the
state
of
arkansas
against
the
state
of
tennessee
under
constitutional
provision
for
original
actions
boundary
disputes
between
states.
the
case

complaint,
statement
and
support
of

and

filed
by
the
state
of

against

state
of

the
court
accepted
the
case
and
appointed
a
senior
district
judge
from
the
state
of
minnesota,
the
hon.
gunnar
nordbye
to
set
as
a
special
master
in
this
case,
a
hearing
was
held
in
memphis,
tennessee
in
august
and
september
of
1968.
the
master
entered
its
report
finding
against
the
interest
of
the
state
of
arkansas
and
the
case
now
comes
before
this
court
on
exceptions
filed
by
the
state
of
arkansas
to
that
report
and
our
brief
in
support
thereof.
as
a
preliminary
statement
concerning
this
case,
when
this
case
came
to
the
attention
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
we
hired
a
special
counsel,
george
cracraft
of
helena
who
is
a
specialist
in
this
type
of
field
concerning
river
boundaries.
in
arkansas,
there
are
a
few
specialist
in
this
and
we
felt
that
he
was
specially
qualified
to
handle
this
case.
however,
after
the
case
was
tried
and
it
was
briefed
to
the
master,
mr.
cracraft
was
elected
as
a
chancery
judge
in
1968
and
began
his
term
in
august
of
1969.
we
felt
that
mr.
cracraft
would
handle
this
case
for
us
here
before
this
court
but
we
discovered
a
constitutional
provision
in
arkansas,
which
is
article
7
section
25,
which
prohibit
our
judges
to
practice
in
lo
and
behold
state
and
federal
courts.
the
area
--
to
move
on,
the
area
in
controversy
between
the
states
of
arkansas
and
tennessee
comprised
some
5,000
acres
and
lies
physically
on
the
west
bank
or
the
arkansas
side
of
the
main
channel,
and
according
to
all
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
before
the
master,
it
has
been
there
for
at
least
--
as
long
as
any
witness
who
was
presented
could
recall.
when
the
matter
came
to
the
attention
of
the
state
of
arkansas
upon
the
complain
of
its
citizens
who
lived
in
crittenden
county
adjacent
to
this
area
and
who
had
sensed
the
memory
of
any
particular
witness,
these
citizens
had
been
in
possession
and
control
of
it
to
the
full
extent
of
which
the
land
was
capable
of
possession.
these
people
had
at
various
times
and
places
who
made
the
crops,
engaged
in
husbandry
of
other
sorts
of
raising
cattle,
hogs
and
horses
on
the
property,
and
at
from
time
to
time
severed,
cut
and
removed
valuable
timber
from
the
land
assessing
this
land
and
paying
severance
taxes
to
the
state
of
arkansas
and
--
mr.
don
langston
no
your
honor.
there
had
been
some
but
they
have
long
since
been
removed.
mr.
don
langston
close
to
half
million
dollars,
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
it
can
be
farmed
with
row
crops
and
it
has
very
much
timber
on
it
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
just
hardwood
timber
and
things
of
that
nature
that
will
grow
and
low
type
areas
of
the
alluvial
valley
of
the
mississippi
river.
mr.
don
langston
parts
of
it
are
being
farmed
as
crops.
it
has
been
used
for
crops
and
so
it
remains
in
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
don
langston
it's
attached
to
the
arkansas
side
of
the
river.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
there
is
a
marked
area
along
there,
but
the
area
of
photograph,
which
is
located
in
the
back
of
the
state
of
tennessee
is
free
which
is
on
a
11
appendix
a
6
will
show
that
it
is
--
this
is
a
1929
map
and
the
attachment
to
the
state
of
arkansas
is
even
more
now
than
it
was
in
that
particular
time.
the
only
--
mr.
don
langston
there
are
trees
and
vegetation
and
things
that
do
connect
it
to
the
state
of
arkansas,
which
have
been
filled
in
by
sediment
and
it
is
attached
to
the
state
of
arkansas.
the
portion
how
watery
--
would
some
of
--
would
be
separated
from
the
state
of
it.
from
the
state
of
arkansas,
we
contend
that
it
is
attached
to
our
--
physically
to
our
state.
mr.
don
langston
close
to
five
--
mr.
don
langston
5,000
acres.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
believe
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
they
have
been
--
we
contended
that
they
had
been
paid
in
state
of
arkansas
your
honor,
and
that
the
private
citizens
had
conveyed
consistent
with
the
state
of
arkansas
and
that
no
one
from
the
state
of
tennessee
had
ever
been
on
it
and
that
our
people
had
been
on
it,
had
farmed
it,
paid
taxes
on
it,
conveyed
it
in
accordance
of
the
law
–-
mr.
don
langston
state
of
arkansas
citizens
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
there
was
at
one
time
citizens
--
mr.
don
langston
there
worked
one
time
i
think
a
man
by
the
name
of
paget
who
lived
out
there,
but
most
of
all,
it
was
mostly
people
who
had
adjoining
lands
on
arkansas
that
extended
their
lands
on
that
into
this
particular
area.
mr.
don
langston
on
the
part
of
the
acquiescence
of
our
people
being
out
there
and
he
found
against
the
state
of
arkansas,
we
also
placed
evidence
in
the
record
that
we
built
--
that
the
crittenden
county,
arkansas
built
roads
and
our
game
and
fish
commission
patrol
the
area
for
game
laws
and
that
our
officers
--
police
officers
police
the
area.
as
early
as
1933,
according
to
the
record
in
this
case,
some
litigation
was
conducted
with
regard
to
this
land
in
the
courts
of
tennessee
and
various
claims
were
made
by
the
citizens
of
tennessee
to
the
lands
from
that
date.
however,
the
record
we
think
clearly
reflects
that
no
claimant
of
the
state
of
tennessee
has
ever
put
foot
on
this
ground
and
not
tilt
or
cut
and
remove
any
timber
from
the
land.
we
believe
that
if
counsel
for
tennessee
would
be
completely
candid
with
the
court,
they
would
admit
such
claims
of
citizens
of
tennessee
have
ever
made
the
property
to
the
date
of
this
hearing
have
been
paper
claims
only
and
that
the
only
actual
physical
occupation
of
the
area
has
been
accomplished
by
citizens
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
we
believe
that
the
record
is
also
silent
to
anything
that
the
state
of
tennessee
as
a
sovereign
has
ever
done
to
improve
either
the
value
or
the
use
of
this
area.
so,
for
this
background
in
mind,
the
officials
of
crittenden
county,
the
county
judge,
tax
assessor
and
other
officials
over
in
crittenden
county
prevailed
on
the
attorney
general
and
prevailed
upon
the
governor
of
arkansas
to
request
the
attorney
general
to
bring
this
suit
in
the
name
of
the
state
of
arkansas
to
determine
who
owned
this
property.
on
the
whole
case,
the
master
found
the
fact
of
acquiescence
which
is
our
--
the
citizens
of
arkansas
being
on
the
land,
he
found
this
in
favor
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
and
as
we
understand
the
function
of
the
master
who
was
appointed
by
this
court,
these
findings
are
not
to
be
set
aside
lightly
or
if
there's
any
basis
in
evidence
at
all,
this
court
will
sustain
them.
we
cannot
seriously
urge
that
in
this
--
these
exceptions
to
this
court
to
set
aside
those
findings.
and
the
state
of
arkansas
second,
form
a
position,
is
that
even
though
we
haven't
acquired
the
ownership
of
all
this
area
by
the
acquiescence
power,
the
exercise
complaint
dominion
and
control
over
it
for
a
long
period
of
time,
that
certainly
a
smaller
portion
of
the
area,
then
that
claim
by
the
state
of
tennessee
was
actually
part
of
its
domain
originally.
the
exception
which
we
do
urge
is
not
a
factual
one
but
is
one
of
law
and
the
position
of
the
state
of
arkansas
in
these
exceptions
is
that
even
if
the
basic
facts
as
found
by
the
master
are
true,
he
applied
the
incorrect
rule
of
law
to
the
facts
in
the
local
state
line.
that
brings
us
to
the
first
argued
point
in
our
brief,
which
is
that
the
master
erred
in
concluding
that
the
boundary
continued
to
move
as
long
as
the
abandoned
channel
float
during
high
water.
in
this
argument
on
page
8
of
our
written
brief,
the
rule
is
adopted
by
the
master,
which
he
felt
was
controlling
and
i
think
both
sides
agree,
which
is
based
on
a
decision
in
arkansas
versus
tennessee
to
the
effect
that
though
the
main
channel
is
a
movable
one
and
the
channel
of
navigation
in
a
navigable
stream,
that
after
an
avulsion
and
as
a
result
of
an
avulsion,
the
change
in
boundary
is
not
affected.
the
case
rules
as
stated
on
page
8,
the
effect
of
an
avulsion
is
not
complete
until
it
stagnates
and
ceases
to
run
and
as
long
as
the
channel
remains
a
running
stream,
the
boundary
marked
by
it
may
be
moved
by
an
erosion.
but
we
contend
that
when
stagnation
occurs,
the
process
then
is
at
an
end.
we
quote
from
that
case,
the
boundary
then
becomes
fixed
in
the
middle
of
the
channel,
as
this
court
has
defined
it
and
the
gradual
filling
up
of
the
bad
that
ensues
is
not
to
be
treated
as
accretion
to
the
shores
but
as
an
ultimate
effect
of
the
avulsion.
now
the
master
in
his
report
while
he
did
recognize
this
rule
and
quoted
it
in
his
report,
has
very
clearly,
erroneously
applied
the
rule
in
the
same
manner
that
tennessee's
principal
witness,
mr.
rodgers
misapplied
it
in
the
quoted
testimony
on
page
9
of
our
article.
mr.
rodgers
states
that
his
entire
report
as
to
the
location
of
the
land
between
the
two
states
and
the
matter
is
based
upon
the
application
of
the
rule
that
we
--
that
i
just
recited.
when
the
water
stagnates
at
ordinary
high
water
and
when
it
ceases
to
run
at
ordinary
high
water,
instead
of
the
low
water.
he
also
admitted
in
the
same
quoted
testimony
that
he
did
not
know
and
made
no
attempt
to
establish
a
line
along
that
area
where
the
water
stagnated
at
low
water.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
we
feel
that
he
followed
the
tennessee
witness
rodgers
testimony
to
the
letter
in
finding
this,
we
feel
that
in
the
old
abandoned
channel
that
the
master
never
did
find
when
the
water
stagnated
at
low
--
at
low
water
which
we
claim
that
this
court
has
said
he
must
do.
he
did
contend
that
he
followed
that
rule
but
he
couldn't
held
because
he
followed
the
testimony
of
rodgers
who
never
did
set
the
time
that
the
water
first
stagnated
and
the
land
became
fixed.
mr.
rodgers
kept
saying
that
every
time
high
water
would
come
in,
it
would
erode
a
way
and
move
the
boundary
and
he
kept
accreting
into
the
arkansas
shore
and
the
master
adopted
--
the
master
adopted
mr.
rodgers'
testimony
that
the
boundary
keeps
moving
every
--
and
the
old,
abandoned
channel
keeps
moving
every
time
the
high
water
comes
in
and
there's
some
more
erosion.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor,
if
he's
correct
in
saying
that
if
he
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
boundary
does
not
become
fixed
when
the
water
first
stagnates
and
doesn't
move,
then
the
state
of
arkansas
doesn't
have
a
case,
but
if
the
rule
is
that
the
water
first
time
it
stagnates
which
we
contend
it
did
in
about
1917,
or
1918,
then
his
report
is
erroneous.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
unless
the
river
came
back
cut
all
the
way
passed
the
old
dead
thalweg.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
right.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
and
high
water.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
the
master's
contention
and
then
it's
our
contention
and
once
the
water
is
stagnating,
the
dead
thalweg
became
the
fixed
boundary.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
tennessee
would
have
an
enclave
that
in
accordance
with
our
engineer's
exhibit,
would
have
an
enclave
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
mr.
don
langston
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
we
talked
about
this,
i'm
not
sure
what
--
that
this
court
could
enter
judgment
on
it
or
whether
it
would
have
to
be
sent
back
for
additional
--
for
a
commissioner
or
someone
to
set
that
your
honor.
we've
discussed
that
and
in
my
notes
here,
i
have
either
this
court
should
do
it
or
send
it
back.
mr.
don
langston
our
engineer
mr.
smith
did
plan
out
the
property
by
geodetic
positions
on
one
of
our
exhibits
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
well,
it
couldn't
be
until
after
1955.
mr.
don
langston
a
couple
of
years
after
1915
or
16.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
that
--
that's
exactly
our
position
that
he
should
have
found
that
--
that
he
should
have
found
that
the
old
channel
died
and
--
it's
our
position
that
mr.
rodgers
also
admitted
in
the
same
quoted
testimony
that
he
did
not
know
and
made
no
attempt
to
establish
a
line
along
the
area
where
the
water
stagnated
at
low
water.
the
master
in
adopting
the
rodgers'
report
completely
erred
in
fixing
the
state
line
in
exactly
the
same
place
rodgers
did,
he
has
applied
the
same
rule,
that
is
that
the
line
becomes
fixed
only
if
the
water
does
not
run
through
the
old
channel
at
ordinary
high
water
stages.
this
is
the
ruling
that
even
though
if
might
stagnate
and
not
run
and
even
sustain
vegistation
at
low
water
time.
when
the
water
is
high
the
water
comes
up
to
again
to
ordinary
high
water,
the
land
again
becomes
fluid
and
it
moves
with
the
scarring
effect
of
high
water
flow.
that's
more
along
the
line
of
what
mr.
justice
white
was
asking.
we
insist
here
that
this
cannot
be
what
this
court
intended
in
its
prior
decisions
or
that
it
intended
for
these
old
avulsions
or
could
all
should
remain
in
dispute
and
flew
it
for
many
years.
the
only
other
witness
who
testified
to
these
matters
was
alston
smith
whose
qualifications
were
set
forth
in
the
transcript
to
the
record
on
pages
40
to
47
who
has
testified
in
many
matters
involving
state
lines
over
a
hundred
in
number.
i
think
he
has
participated
in
some
16
of
these
cutoffs
such
as
this
and
whose
opinion
has
been
accepted
by
this
court
on
at
least
two
recent
occasions
which
i
referred
to
in
our
brief.
it
was
a
testimony
of
our
witness,
the
state
of
arkansas
witness
that
his
training
and
experience
indicated
clearly
that
in
a
cutoff
of
this
kind,
stagnation
would
occur
immediately
and
within
two
or
three
years.
there
are
no
maps
or
data
available
as
to
when
stagnation
occurred
but
his
experience
in
these
cutoffs
and
call
upon
his
training
being
with
the
mississippi
river
commission
for
35
years
and
charge
navigation
enraging
that
stagnation
would
occur
within
two
years
from
1915
to
16
when
the
cutoff
became
complete.
in
quotations
from
the
record
set
forth
on
page
12
of
our
argument
mr.
smith
indicates
that
within
a
couple
of
years
the
land
would
stagnate
and
become
sedimented
and
that
low
water
would
have
no
flow.
the
state
of
tennessee
has
criticized
or
has
taken
the
state
of
arkansas
to
task
in
its
brief
concerning
that
we
say
that
alston
smith
gave
the
only
competent
testimony
in
this
case.
we
don't
except
--
what
we
mean
by
competent
evidence
is
that
rogers
base
his
entire
report
on
a
--
an
improper
premise,
that
what
makes
his
testimony
incompetent
that
he
didn't
found
when
the
water
first
stagnated
but
that
he
said
that
ground
remain
fluid
when
water
flowed
through
that
ordinary
high
water.
that's
the
reason
why
we
contend
that
he
is
testimony
concerning
--
that
is
incompetent
because
he
based
it
on
the
false
premise.
as
for
our
second
argument
--
mr.
don
langston
now,
the
state
of
tennessee
says
if
the
master
never
did
find
that
but
i
think
from
your
conclusions
--
from
the
conclusions
that
from
that
you've
got
to
say
that
and
that
he
did
by
not
saying
if
he
did
say
that
because
the
map
that
he
attaches
to
his
report
follows
the
line
by
rogers
and
that
was
rogers'
testimony
and
they
couldn't
--
there
couldn't
be
any
other
way
he
abridged
it.
mr.
don
langston
the
exceptions.
mr.
don
langston
excuse
me
it's
attached
to
the
master's
report,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
don
langston
that's
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
roger
said
he
didn't
know,
our
witness
said
it
occurred
in
two
years
after
1915,
16
and
roger's
only
testimony
was
--
mr.
don
langston
it
was
on
rogers'
testimony.
mr.
don
langston
he
said
that
he
had
seen
a
foot
of
water
there
even
after
1955.
so
that
means
that
he
never
did
actually.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
master's
report
is
still
going
to
allow
this
land
to
move
if
it
--
an
ordinary
high
water
if
it
moves
into
the
state
of
arkansas.
it's
still
fluid
under
master's
conclusion.
mr.
don
langston
that's
the
only
conclusion
you
can
come
to
you
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
there
is
difference,
yes
your
honor.
we
feel
that
he
would
let
the
line
move
at
ordinary
high
water
and
also
that
the
flood
water
would
also
be
involved
too.
so
we
think
that
he
has
never
fixed
actually
--
of
course
--
he
has
fixed
it
but
still
under
his
theory
it
still
fluid.
mr.
don
langston
roger
said
he
didn't
know.
that's
quoted
in
our
brief
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
at
ordinary
high
water.
so
he
is
saying
that
the
water
never
has
stagnated.
mr.
don
langston
he
never
says
that's
the
reason
when
we
say
his
testimony
is
incompetent.
mr.
don
langston
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
if
it
would
be
--
if
it
calls
some
incretion
it
would
still
be
making
the
boundary
fluid.
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
the
state
of
tennessee
says
at
3.1
on
the
memphis
gauge,
it
was
our
contention
that
it
would
be
at
zero
at
memphis
gauge,
that
it
would
stagnant
but
we
will
accept
the
state
of
tennessee's
contention.
mr.
don
langston
that
it
would
be
enough
probably
to
call
some
accretions.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
think
there's
any
testimony
on
that
your
honor.
i
don't
recall.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
really,
your
honor,
i
just
don't
remember
on
that
point
your
honor.
the
next
point
that
we
attempt
to
make
in
our
new
exemptions
is
really
based
on
our
first
contention
that
if
the
court
does
not
hold
from
state
of
arkansas
on
his
first
contention
then
the
second
contention
is
also
out.
that
second
contention
is
that
the
master
erred
in
extending
the
tennessee
lands
laterally
down
the
stream
so
as
to
deny
arkansas
access
to
navigable
channel.
the
2845
of
the
state
of
arkansas
is
attempting
to
develop
here,
is
that
state
lines
are
supposed
to
be
permanent
and
supposed
to
be
fixed
and
suppose
to
be
known
and
that
this
court
didn't
intend
for
them
remain
fluid
and
movable
after
one
of
these
avulsions
indefinitely.
we
are
saying
that
this
court
wants
after
an
avulsion
they
want
to
--
it
wants
the
state
line
to
be
set
and
not
be
moving
and
be
fluid
in
depth.
that
when
this
court
indicated
that
it
was
to
become
fixed
at
stagnation,
it
meant
as
soon
as
stagnation
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
an
exception
to
the
rule
rather
than
the
rule
and
these
exceptions
should
not
be
permitted
to
overwrite
the
rule
itself.
we
think
the
whole
idea
is
to
fix
the
boundary
and
to
get
it
fixed
as
soon
as
possible,
well
at
the
same
time
preserve
whatever
rights
either
party
might
have
and
might
have
lost
as
a
result
of
the
avulsion.
it
is
not
a
cure
all
but
simply
something
to
preserve
as
near
as
possible
the
rights
of
either
party.
on
this
point
we
simply
take
the
position
that
the
master's
finding
of
fact
kept
the
old
channel
open
too
long,
should
have
sedimented
in
smith's
scar,
as
our
witness
smith
did
it.
within
a
few
years
there
after
it
was
low
water
time
and
movement
that
it
made
after
that
period
would
have
no
effect
on
the
boundary
because
the
boundary
became
fixed.
we
emphasize
that
when
the
stagnation
occurred,
the
old
thalweg
no
longer
existed,
it
was
dead.
the
new
channel
of
the
river
was
then
the
live
thalweg
and
above
and
below
its
point
of
intersection
was
a
dead
thalweg,
the
live
thalweg
became
movable.
we
also
have
emphasize
the
point
that
this
court
should
not
permit
the
dead
thalweg
which
is
not
alive,
which
has
no
life
to
override
and
control
the
live
point.
this
is
all
tied
in
with
our
argument
which
is
beginning
on
page
14
of
our
brief.
the
cases
seem
to
hold
very
clearly
that
you
can
extend
these
formations
upstream
and
downstream
so
far
as
to
cut
off
access
and
navigation.
this
is
historical
and
has
always
run
through
our
law
as
the
right
of
access
that
seems
to
give
rise
to
this
root.
we
don't
want
this
court
to
cut
--
to
allow
the
state
of
tennessee
to
cut
off
the
state
of
arkansas
access
to
the
river
for
some
two
miles
upstream
and
four
miles
downstream
from
the
dead
thalweg.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor
of
course
the
federal
government
has
pretty
much
taken
over
navigation
on
these
rivers
but
we
feel
that
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you
is
we
thought
this
out
when
we
were
studying
this
case
that
it's
sort
of
historical
and
the
access
to
the
river
is
a
right
of
property
and
should
not
be
dealt
with
lively
and
it
should
--
mr.
don
langston
well,
we
think
the
old
state
has
access
there
too
your
honor.
we
don't
have
any
plans
to
develop
a
report
or
anything
if
it
would
answer
your
question.
mr.
don
langston
well
the
state
of
arkansas
owns
to
the
bed
of
the
stream
your
honor
and
it
could
--
mr.
don
langston
in
arkansas
your
honor,
the
private
owners
own
only
to
the
high
water
mark
and
the
state
of
arkansas
owns
from
the
high
watermark
to
the
bed
of
the
stream.
mr.
don
langston
what
argument
is
that
your
honor?
mr.
don
langston
yes.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor,
that
was
the
gist
of
cross
of
examination
of
witness
rogers
that's
set
forth
in
our
brief
is
that
he
never
did
to
fix
the
time
when
they
–
well
are
you
talking
about
the
access?
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor
we
said
that
the
land
should
not
be
extended
down
stream
from
the
dead
thalweg
or
up
stream
from
it.
we
did
make
this
argument.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
he
gives
it
to
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
i
don't
believe,
i
don't
know
what
they
did
or
not
but
he
gives
it
to
the
state
of
tennessee
on
leisure
of
rogers
testimony.
i'm
advised
by
the
social
counsel
that
he
did
not.
mr.
don
langston
i
really
don't
know
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
did
advance
it
but
may
be
not
as
vehemently
as
we
have
here.
i
believe
that
would
be
better
for
my
position.
mr.
don
langston
i
believe
it
would
your
honor
because
the
thalweg
would
have
been
moving
each
time
and
under
the
master's
theory,
it
would
been
moving
downstream
and
upstream.
the
master
found
that
the
old
thalweg
did
not
die,
that
it
is
still
fluid
and
moves
in
ordinary
high
water,
that's
our
contention.
so
every
time
there's
an
erosion
or
something,
that
moves
the
what
we
call
the
dead
thalweg
so
to
prevail
on
your
point
that
is
prevailed
under
the
your
second
point,
you
must
prevail
on
the
first.
we
say
that
the
thalweg
cutoff
here
and
on
this
downstream
is
our
and
all
the
upstream
is
our
but
i
ask
the
--
mr.
don
langston
we
sort
of
had
it
tied
in
with
our
first
point
but
i
do
see
what
you're
talking
about
i
believe
and
maybe
it's
not
tied
in
as
much
with
the
second
point
as
in
with
the
first
point
as
i
thought
it
was.
we
were
mostly
relying
on
the
brootes
(ph)
case
on
this
particular
argument
but
we
will
take
that
land
anyway
we
can
get
it.[laughter]
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
then
--
mr.
don
langston
yes
sir,
i
will
have
to
hurry.
your
honor
before
i
get
away
from
this
early
period
of
time,
in
our
brief
i
have
put
a
very
small
picture
here
of
a
1921
map.
this
is
at
appendix
a
5.
mr.
don
langston
the
reply
brief.
mr.
don
langston
thank
you
your
honor.
i
suppose
that
the
man
from
tennessee
probably
got
the
mule
over
there
for
crossing
the
memphis
arkansas
bridge
and
came
to
arkansas
in
crittenden
county
and
came
down
to
the
property
from
there.
mr.
don
langston
this
would
have
been
the
memphis
arkansas
bridge
up
the
river.
mr.
don
langston
no,
your
honor
it's
a
--
we
can't
claim
it
was
passable
by
just
own
foot
that
the
channel
--
most
the
--
a
lot
of
channel
--
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor,
the
channel
dried
up.
the
course
of
the
channel
dried
up
and
trees
and
sediment
field
in
there
where
you
can
cross
it
by
foot
or
anyway,
by
vehicle,
wagon
or
anything.
i
think
that
the
exhibit
--
mr.
don
langston
at
one
time
there
was
a
house
owner
your
honor
i
think
in
that.
mr.
don
langston
pretty
primitive,
if
i
remember.
mr.
don
langston
it
is
in
the
record
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
1929
map
in
which
appendix
a
6
to
their
brief
shows
that
there's
at
back
of
course
1929
i
don't
know
what
state
of
the
river
this
was
but
there
is
sediment
in
this
from
the
old
channel.
some
along
in
here
and
some
have
been
here.
so
you
can
cross
from
arkansas
on
this
by
foot
or
by
vehicle.
mr.
don
langston
you
can
go
by
mule
and
wagon.
the
state
of
tennessee
in
their
brief
and
in
their
argument
here
has
taken
arkansas
to
task
because
of
its
pleadings
in
this
particular
case.
when
we
did
draft
our
pleadings,
we
did
allege
that
there
was
no
avulsion.
this
was
based
on
testimony
and
this
was
based
on
what
we
felt
was
the
case
but
whenever
our
engineer
got
in
to
it,
we
found
out
that
we
could
not
take
the
position
that
there
had
not
been
some
sort
of
an
avulsion
here.
they
say
that
smith,
our
expert
changed
his
testimony,
i
think
that
i
can
explain
to
the
court
why
his
testimony
was
changed.
whenever
he
first
started
testifying
concerning
this
in
private
litigation,
he
took
the
position
that
there
had
been
no
avulsion
and
the
reason
why
he
did
this
was
that
at
that
time
alone
in
this
particular
area
had
not
become
definite
or
crystallized
and
was
not
certain.
smith
took
the
position
around
15
years
ago
that
this
--
what
they
call
a
middle
bar
or
mud
bar
that
became
this
part
would
--
did
not
have
any
vegetation
on
it
and
that
low
water
was
the
only
time
that
it
came
up
as
sand
and
mud,
he
took
the
position
and
the
law
was
not
clear
that
that
changes
on
each
side
of
that
particular
thing
would
not
be
an
avulsion
or
would
not
move
the
thalweg
or
the
river
but
a
case
from
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
was
certiorari
was
denied
up
here
and
which
is
211
uhlhorn
versus
us
gypsum
company
366
f.2d.
211
certiorari
denied
here
385
us
1026
said
that
yes
whenever
the
avultive
part
was
you
could
see
it
at
low
water
that
changes
on
each
side
of
that
would
result
in
an
avulsion,
that
is
the
reason
why
his
testimony
was
changed
from
the
time
we
plead
and
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
and
we
do
not
think
that
his
position
is
inconsistent,
he
was
just
instructed
to
take
this
case
into
consideration
by
our
attorneys
--
by
the
state's
attorneys
whenever
he
formed
his
report
and
he
had
to
follow
the
yula
horn
decision
and
saying
yes
there
was
an
avulsion
but
he
did
say
that
he
wasn't
sure
that
there
really
was
but
he
was
going
to
give
the
state
of
tennessee
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
say,
“yes
there
was
a
small
avulsion
still
remain
there
due
to
the
master's
and
pilot's
report
of
the
middle
bar
or
a
mud
bar.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
severance
taxes
maybe
all
for
timber
and
few
things
like
that
but
i
don't
think
that
taxes
would
be
very
much.
but
it
has
so
list
as
the
record
reflects
has
sold
these
lands
for
taxes
over
there
in
arkansas.
that's
how
the
arkansas
--
the
land
has
sold
in
arkansas.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
it
has
sold
tax
that
has
been
forfeited
for
taxes
and
it
forfeits
to
the
state
and
then
the
state
to
its
land
commissioner
gives
tax
deeds
so
it
has
derived
some
revenue
from
it.
mr.
don
langston
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i'm
advised
that
someone
asked
that
there
was
--
how
much
forming
land
there
was
on,
there's
approximately
500
acres
that
can
be
farmed
there
now.
mr.
don
langston
out
of
5,000
most
of
this
timber
land.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
they're
doing.
mr.
don
langston
that's
what
our
citizens
are
doing.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
we
have
formed
that
all
along
our
citizens
have.
mr.
don
langston
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
i
wouldn't
think
so,
of
course
here
the
river
would
make
it
too
feasible
but
you
could
own
some
on
both
sides.
i
think
mr.
sutton
in
his
--
when
he
was
being
questioned
by
mr.
justice
white
clearly
shows
the
arkansas
position
is
the
one
that
should
be
accepted
by
this
court.
the
prior
case
of
arkansas
versus
tennessee
says
that
when
the
strange
stagnates
and
ceases
to
flow
and
it
smells
bad
and
that's
when
the
land
is
set
that
any
accretions
or
any
erosion
or
accretion
is
a
natural
result
of
that
avulsion.
mr.
sutton
wants
these
accretions
and
erosions
to
keep
moving
this
line
even
though
it's
not
the
channel
anymore.
he
wants
that
the
case
of
tennessee
versus
arkansas
says
that
these
erosions
and
accretions
are
--
and
sedimentations
is
a
natural
result
of
the
dying
of
the
old
thalweg.
that's
why
this
court
has
to
decide
when
and
where
the
old
thalweg
died
because
if
it
keeps
eroding
and
keeps
accreting,
it's
really
not
dead
and
it
keeps
moving
and
its
fluid
which
is
what
this
court
does
in
its
prior
decision
seems
to
say
it
does
want
to
do,
it
wants
to
have
the
old
dead
thalweg
inactive
and
then
let
the
new
one
control
the
lands.
mr.
don
langston
he
still
says
it's
a
--
he
says
--
but
the
accretions
that
attached
to
it
and
the
erosions
that
are
attached
to
it
will
move
the
state
line
if
he
says
--
his
position
is
that
it
has
done
it
though
--
mr.
don
langston
we
don't
agree
where
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
right.
he
claim
--
the
state
of
tennessee
claims
that
these
accretions
and
erosions
have
moved
--
we
claim
it's
in,
what
they
term
is
smith
scar.
mr.
don
langston
that's
not
our
position
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
the
accretions
built
down
from
the
arkansas
shore
and
attached
to
this
evolved
there.
mr.
don
langston
yes
your
honor.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
yes.
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
we
claim
that
the
thalweg
died
at
around
1918
in
that
particular
point
and
it
could
not
move
any
further.
mr.
don
langston
any
movement
of
it
would
--
mr.
don
langston
that's
correct.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor
it's
our
position
that
this
evolved
area
keep
eroding
away
and
got
to
where
smith
scar
was
whenever
the
thalweg
died.
the
important
thing
here,
we
think
the
court
to
decide
is
when
and
where
this
thalweg
died
set
the
boundary
line
there
in
a
definite
place
and
a
portion
of
these
lands
and
accordance
there
with.
we
either
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
fact
that
reversed
the
conclusions
of
the
master
and
inner
findings
and
inconsistency
with
our
position
or
to
send
that
matter
back
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
we
filed
this
lawsuit
on
the
basis
of
request
from
officials
of
crittenden
county
who
were
prevailed
upon
by
the
private
citizens
who
were
involved
there.
mr.
don
langston
i
think
it
is
your
honor
and
the
county
officials
prevailed
upon
the
governor
to
request
the
attorney
general
to
file
the
lawsuit.
it
originates
from
these
private
persons
who
were
involved
in
litigation
tennessee
the
private
arkansas
persons
who
claim
the
land.
mr.
don
langston
we
have
took
the
position
that
the
tennessee
litigation
which
decided
the
issue
in
favor
of
the
tennessee
people
would
preclude
our
arkansas
residents
of
filing
anything
in
the
state
court
of
arkansas.
mr.
don
langston
your
honor,
i
don't
know
but
since
we've
been
losing
this
case
we're
probably
happy
to
do
that.
mr.
don
langston
i
suppose
it
would
your
honor,
i
really
don't
know.
