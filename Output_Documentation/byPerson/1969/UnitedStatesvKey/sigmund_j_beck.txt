mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
always
been
my
view
that
all
cases
ought
to
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
their
facts
and
certainly
it's
true
in
this
instance
in
an
equitable
proceedings.
the
facts
are
more
fully
elaborated
in
our
brief
but
there
are
some
highlights
and
i
think
should
be
brought
out.
it's
true
that
this
case
in
may
of
1954,
the
original
plan
was
confirmed
in
1957
under
the
terms
of
that
plan
without
going
into
details.
the
reorganized
debtor
took
over
the
assets
and
property
from
the
trustee
in
june
of
1958.
it
began
operating
without
a
control
of
the
court.
in
december
of
1961,
the
trustee
filed
a
petition
for
final
decree.
hearing
was
to
be
held
on
that
in
march
of
1962.
in
february
of
1962,
there
became
a
change
in
the
directors,
the
corporation
had
had
financial
difficulties
and
they
then
entered
into
a
contract
of
sale
with
hennis
freight
lines
for
$1
million
principal
and
interest
included
over
a
period
of
time
of
78
months.
prior
to
the
hearing
on
final
decree,
three
creditors
who
had
come
into
being
subsequent
to
the
reorganized
debtor
taking
over
the
assets
asked
the
court
to
have
the
trustee
retake
the
property
and
assets
alleging
insolvency.
this
took
place
hearing
was
held
and
the
court
vested
the
trustee
with
the
assets
and
property
of
the
debtor
corporation.
investigations
are
placed
to
trustee
then
moved
to
affirm
the
contract
of
sale
with
hennis.
the
court
affirmed
that
contract
in
august
of
1962.
it
took
three
years
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
finally
approve
the
sale.
when
it
did
approve
the
sale,
it
entered
a
restriction
upon
the
rights.
now,
the
restriction
have
entered
was
a
sort
of
limited
restriction.
it
did
not
include
a
reduction
of
mileage.
the
original
contract
provided
that
should
the
icc
reduced
the
mileage
then
hennis
would
be
entitled
to
a
reduction.
there
was
dispute
between
the
trustee
and
hennis
as
to
what
the
price
should
be.
we
finally
reached
an
agreement
whereby
the
maximum
amount
of
the
sale
was
to
be
viewed
as
$935,000.000
instead
of
a
million
and
again
is
inclusive
of
the
interest
payable
over
the
same
period
of
time.
then
in
addition,
the
trustee
would
offer
in
the
plan
a
20%
compromise
to
unsecured
creditors
and
any
reduction
of
price
would
rip
down
then
to
hennis.
now,
that
of
course
are
the
facts
right
bearing
up
to
this.
the
plan
then
of
course
was
approved
subsequently
hearing
on
approval
subsequent
hearing
on
conformation,
the
plan
was
confirmed.
the
united
states
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that
is
correct.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
20%
of
their
claims.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
total.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
now,
the
government
is
correct,
this
is
a
plan
for
liquidation.
now
bearing
in
mind
that
it's
a
plan
of
liquidation
something
else
comes
into
play
here
and
that
is
what
would
happen
in
the
event
of
liquidation.
i
would
like
to
point
out
two
matters
before
i
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
it
is
still
a
reorganization
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no
question
about.
it
is
our
view
however
mr.
justice
white
that
in
valuing
the
assets
in
this
case,
we
obviously
cannot
value
the
assets
on
the
basis
of
a
growing
concern
but
only
on
the
basis
of
liquidation
the
value
of
the
assets
which
is
being
transferred.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no.
the
government
takes
its
view
point
but
they
are
entitled
to
absolute
priority
of
the
3466.
we
don't
understand
what
they
mean
by
absolute
priority,
frankly.
absolute
priority
is
set
forth
in
the
case
case
--
case
against
los
angeles
lumber
has
to
do
with
the
relative
priorities
of
the
senior
creditors.
we
contend
that
the
priority
granted
by
--
to
the
united
states
is
incorporated
in
chapter
x,
in
section
199
and
that
is
the
priority
that
they
get.
now,
we
never
contend
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
priority.
they
are.
we
contend
that
they're
getting
it.
now,
we
contend
that
the
major
question
here
is
whether
or
not
section
216
(7)
is
applicable
to
the
united
states.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
because
i
don't
think
in
that
particular
point
that
would
be
fair
and
equitable
because
at
that
particular
point
you
would
be
using
money
which
rightfully
belongs
to
a
senior
creditor
for
the
benefit
of
a
junior
creditor.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
don't
think
that's
quite
true.
well,
i
think
it
must
recognize
in
full
a
priority
and
i
think
this
plan
does
recognize
in
full
a
priority.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that
is
not
quite
true.
the
available
cash
that's
available
comes
in
on
installments.
there
will
be
available
cash.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way
then.
i
don't
believe
that
the
senior
creditor
is
any
more
senior
in
this
particular
program
than
the
other
tax
claimants
though
the
wage
claimant
and
remember
that
in
this
particular
case
it
is
not
just
the
united
states
that
is
being
deferred
there
are
three
other
tax
creditors
that
are
also
being
deferred
and
they
are
being
protected
by
the
asset,
by
the
fund
which
has
been
set
aside.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
there
is
no
priority
in
the
statute.
in
this
particular
point,
i
would
say
that
in
my
view
we
have
to
go
on
what
the
congress
has
enacted
and
it
would
appear
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
in
a
straight
chapter
x,
i
would
say
yes.
i
would
not
disagree.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
yes,
but
i
think
we
must
view
in
the
light
of
liquidation
and
what
the
bankruptcy
priorities
would
be
because
what
the
alternative
to
this
is,
is
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
am
saying
that
the
rules
of
reorganization
are
equitable
rules
and
they
are
flexible
and
that
this
court
has
decided
time
and
again
that
the
rules
in
equity
proceedings
must
be
flexible
depending
upon
the
type
of
situation
and
i
think
we
have
such
a
situation
here.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
think
that
we
follow
them.
i
think
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
my
recollection
is
i
don't
recall
whether
they
cited
the
case
in
them
or
not.
i
didn't
think
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
i
can't
answer
that.
we've
cited
it.
we
think
we
followed
and
we
believe
that
this
actually
fits
the
case
against
los
angeles.
dictum
or
even
not
dictum
really
is
the
policy
and
that
is
equity
proceedings
in
chapter
x
reorganizations
must
be
governed
by
flexible
rules.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
can't
answer
of
course
for
the
judges
of
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i'll
be
happy
to
do
that.
with
your
honest
permission,
i
see
we
have
got
about
30
seconds
left
and
i
will
defer
my
chance
until
the
opening
of
the
recess.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
before
the
recess
as
to
the
circuit
court's
opinion
with
respect
to
this
case.
in
looking
at
it,
the
only
reason
that
i
can
believe
that
they
did
not
cite
the
case
or
consolidated
proceedings
was
that
they
based
their
decision
one,
on
the
grounds
of
3466
did
not
apply
at
section
199,
216
(7),
and
221
are
the
provisions
of
chapter
x
which
apply.
and
in
talking
in
terms
of
even
the
absolute
priority
rule,
their
view
was
written
on
page
79
of
the
appendix
in
which
they
stated
that
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
approved
plan
contemplates
that
the
united
states
will
be
paid
in
full.
going
on
further
they
cite
we
hold
that
the
trial
court
did
not
urge
in
permitting
lesser
ranking
creditors
to
receive
payment
simultaneously.
under
the
plan,
the
government
does
not
surrender
its
right
to
full
payment.
now,
nowhere
in
the
act
in
fact
nowhere
can
we
find
that
the
government
or
anyone
else
is
entitled
to
cash
payment
in
a
chapter
x
proceeding.
i
think
perhaps,
it
best
can
be
shown
as
to
why
we
think
that
the
absolute
priority
rule
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
place
in
the
act
which
says
they
must
be
paid
before
a
junior
creditor.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
would
state
in
my
view
whether
the
united
states
is
a
senior
creditor
or
a
junior
creditor.
they
are
not
entitled
to
get
paid
before
any
other
creditors
receive
anything.
they
are
entitled
to
be
assured
of
satisfaction
and
ensured
of
their
payment
and
this
is
done
in
this
instance.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
oh!
yes,
i
do.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
don't
have
any
qualms
about
taking
that.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no,
junior
creditors
may
not
take
something
from
the
senior
creditor.
but
in
this
case,
they're
not
taking
anything
from
the
senior
creditor.
in
fact,
they
are
giving
something
up
and
that's
what
i
think
we
have
to
show.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
yes.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i'm
assuming
now
we
have
valued
correctly
and
that
they
are
entitled
to
that
payment.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
would
say
i
find
nothing
wrong
in
terms
of
that.
there
were
other
factors
have
to
be
considered
as
to
other
reasons
for
equitableness.
it's
just
not
the
question
of
whether
they're
going
to
be
paid.
it's
a
question
of
how
it's
going
to
be.
how
the
security
is
fashion?
how
it's
going
to
be
paid
out?
and
that
fact
that
the
creditors
are
paid
out
in
full
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
then
i
say
it's
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
don’t
think
he's
entitled
to
it.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
think
i'm
correct
in
view
of
all
the
other
cases.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
necessarily
but
i
will
stick
by
that
position.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
agree.
i
agree,
that's
why
you
cannot
take
it
out
of
context.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no,
i
think
that's
not
the
historical
reason
to
bear
in
mind.
the
historical
reason
for
the
priority
at
least
3466
was
the
right
of
the
sovereign
to
see
to
it
that
its
taxes
were
obtained
in
order
for
the
benefit
of
everybody.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
i
must
have
misunderstood.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
yes
and
there's
nothing
in
this
case
that
says
they
won't
be
nor
other
cases
where
i
can
see
where
solvency
is
at
issue.
now,
any
true
reorganization
involving
that
situation
that
mr.
justice
white
contemplates
would
necessarily
have
to
have
a
solvent
corporation
coming
out
or
the
senior
creditor
would
be
jeopardized.
let
me
indicate
to
you
the
practicalities
of
this
and
why
i
say
this
is
true
in
this
instance
and
i
can
think
of
many
others
where
it
might
not
be.
this
is
the
plan.
the
plan
provides
for
a
total
payout
of
$925,600.00
under
the
plan,
that's
the
total
cost.
no
one
disagrees
that
the
administration
claims
are
entitled
to
be
paid
first.
there
is
some
disagreement
as
to
the
why
do
the
wages
should
be
paid
first
in
a
true
chapter
x.
there
is
no
such
quarrel
in
a
straight
paragraphs.
this
is
the
united
states
claim
for
$375,000.00.
these
are
the
other
form
or
taxing
authority,
these
three
class
three,
four
and
five
received
are
in
the
same
position
as
the
united
states.
the
first
distribution
indicates
what
happens.
the
united
states
receives
$37,500.00
or
10%.
indiana
then
the
broward
county
and
ohio
also
received
their
10%.
the
miscellaneous
taxes
incidentally
some
30
other
taxing
authorities
received
this
$14,000.00
or
100%.
thus,
these
two
which
would
ordinarily
in
bankruptcy
at
least
have
the
same
established
priority
or
out
in
the
way
in
order
to
solve
the
problem.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that's
correct,
but
in
bankruptcy
that
they
entitle
to
pro
rate
with
the
united
states.
now,
these
are
all
the
general
claims
and
they're
receiving
20%.
it
will
take
under
the
plan.
this
is
how
it
will
go,
at
the
end
of
54
equal
monthly
payments
the
united
states
together
with
the
other
three
will
have
receive
72.3%
of
their
debt.
and
at
the
end
of
the
six
and
a
half
years,
i
suppose
they
have
received
the
whole
100%.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
value
was
there.
i
will
come
to
it
in
a
minute.
what
i
would
like
at
this
particular
point
to
show
the
other
chart
and
what
would
happen
in
the
alternative
in
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
at
the
initial
distribution.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
because
your
honor
the
20%
is
a
compromise
of
their
claims
as
i
will
show
in
liquidation.
they
would
be
entitled
to
anywhere
from
26%
to
36%
depending
upon
the
cost
of
administration
in
the
straight
bankruptcy.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that
is
correct.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that's
all
they
ever
get.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that's
the
end
of
the
line.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
get
100%.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
yes
sir,
everybody
else
receives
100%
except
the
creditors.
the
stockholders
of
course
are
wipeout.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
let
me
put
it
at
this
way.
there
is
no
question
in
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
as
to
the
capability
of
hennis
to
continue
to
pay
it.
the
testimony
in
the
court
indicates
not
only
that
the
asset
itself
has
increased
in
value.
remember,
that
the
asset
which
is
being
sold
to
hennis
is
still
belonging
to
those
four
creditors
under
a
general
mortgage,
a
security
agreement.
and
their
addition
to
which
hennis
is
shown
by
the
record
is
continually
making
a
profit
and
it
continues
to
grow.
now,
here
is
the
alternative
to
the
plan
because
there
is
no
question
that
in
so
far
as
the
sale
of
this
asset
is
concerned
i
cannot
foresee
how
the
district
court
is
going
to
go
back
on
the
sale
that
took
so
long
to
be
approved.
here's
what
happens
in
bankruptcy.
this
is
the
order
of
priority.
the
administration
cost
$60,000.00
again
100%,
$15,000.00
for
the
wages
a
100%.
remember
now
that
the
united
states
on
the
bankruptcy
shares
equally
with
the
remainder
of
the
taxing
authorities.
they
therefore,
will
receive
at
the
initial
distribution
42.5%
nothing
gets
paid
to
the
general
creditors.
at
the
end
of
january
1975,
in
other
words
about
four
and
a
half
years,
the
united
states
then
gets
paid
in
full.
so
it
takes
four
and
a
half
years
under
bankruptcy
for
the
united
states
and
the
other
taxing
authorities
to
be
paid
in
full.
at
that
point,
the
general
creditors
then
have
30.04%
which
will
be
distributed
to
them
in
the
remaining
two
years.
at
that
point,
that's
what
they're
giving
up.
if
the
administration
expenses
go
up
to
a
maximum
in
our
brief
of
$90,000.00
and
we
don’t
anticipate
it.
that
would
indicate
they
still
get
26%.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
but
i
contend
that
even
with
the
priority
they
are
still
bound
by
section
216
(7)
of
the
act
which
indicates
that
a
dissenting
creditor
can
be
satisfied
by
various
means
and
in
this
case
they
are
satisfied
by
two
means.
one,
the
sale
of
the
property
has
been
sold
with
their
rights
attaching
to
it
and
in
this
case
the
united
states
does
not
have
a
specific
lien
against
it.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no,
i'm
talking
of
terms
of
216
(7)
and
i'm
talking
in
terms
of
216
(7)
which
is
pointed
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
we're
talking
in
terms
any
plan
of
reorganization
under
this
chapter
shall
include
in
respect
to
creditors
generally
or
some
class
of
them
means
or
provisions
for
overruling
or
modifying
their
rights.
this
216
was
placed
in
there
under
chapter
x
for
the
very
reason
that
we're
here,
a
dissenting
class
of
creditors
could
not
insist
upon
being
paid
out
in
cash
as
the
all
in
equity
receiverships
require.
now,
under
the
all
equity
receivership
there
was
no
way
for
this
to
happen
because
the
senior
creditors
had
to
be
paid
out
in
cash
if
they
insisted.
we
contend
that
that's
what
216
(7)
was
for
and
we
also
believe
that
there
is
nothing
that
excludes
the
united
states
as
a
claimant
from
the
application
of
216.
now,
this
is
where
we
disagree
with
the
government
and
we
contend
that
this
is
true
with
in
other
cases
and
other
security
cases
where
they
are
been
secured
creditors
on
a
particular
piece
of
property.
there
hasn't
been
any
question
that
other
claimants
could
get
paid
and
if
the
security
or
secured
creditor’s
rights
would
be
altered
in
one
of
the
many
ways
of
216
(7).
now,
i
think
the
big
question
here
is
the
interest
question
because
there,
we're
talking
in
terms
of
a
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked.
are
they
getting
a
discounted
value?
i
contend
they
are
not
and
the
reason
i'm
contending
they
are
not
is
because
post
petition
interest
is
not
available
to
tax
claims.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
i
think
it
is.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
do.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
if
justice
will
allow
me
i
would
say
this;
i
think
the
question
is
one
of
substance
not
a
form.
if
we
were
to
continue
these
proceedings
and
begin
to
payout
as
the
money
has
come
in
then
the
united
states
will
not
receive
interest
and
it
will
receive
its
full
principle
as
we
go
along.
there
is
nothing
as
a
matter
of
fact
even
in
these
first
seven
chapters
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
provide
that
the
united
states
must
be
paid
before
anyone
else.
it
provides
that
there
must
provisions
made
for
the
payment
of
the
united
states.
now,
that
to
me
is
the
real
crux
of
it
when
we’re
talking
in
terms
of
substance
or
form.
i
would
go
further
of
course
and
that
is
this;
the
government
insists
that
3466
applies.
the
circuit
court
held
it
did
not.
i
am
convinced
that
3466
does
not
apply
in
chapter
x
proceedings.
i
believe
that
section
199
provides
the
priority
that
the
legislature
granted
the
united
states.
they
indicated
that
this
was
to
make
certain
of
the
united
states
was
going
to
be
paid
its
taxes
and
custom
duties
and
i
just
don’t
think
that
that's
the
question.
now,
i
don't
even
believe
that
there's
a
conflict
between
u.s.
against
andersen
and
this
case.
i
think
that
the
court
stated
the
difference
and
that
was
in
the
united
states
against
andersen
case.
they
were
talking
about
non-tax
debts.
we're
not
talking
about
non-tax
debts
here.
we're
talking
about
the
priority
granted
by
199
because
all
of
these
taxes.
i
think
the
question
of
the
interest
is
important
only
from
one
reason
if
i
am
correct
that
just
thought
of
these
proceedings
and
continuing
on,
there's
only
one
step
in
the
way
than
the
saper
case
applies
and
the
edens
case
applies
and
the
government
is
not
going
to
be
entitled
to
the
interest
on
its
money.
and
for
that
reason,
i
contend
that
it
isn't
discount
and
true
one
more
thing.
there
isn't
any
question
that
if
interest
has
to
be
paid
the
united
states
then
it
has
to
come
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
general
creditors.
now,
that
to
me
is
the
real
crux
of
it
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
i
will
rest.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
always
been
my
view
that
all
cases
ought
to
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
their
facts
and
certainly
it's
true
in
this
instance
in
an
equitable
proceedings.
the
facts
are
more
fully
elaborated
in
our
brief
but
there
are
some
highlights
and
i
think
should
be
brought
out.
it's
true
that
this
case
in
may
of
1954,
the
original
plan
was
confirmed
in
1957
under
the
terms
of
that
plan
without
going
into
details.
the
reorganized
debtor
took
over
the
assets
and
property
from
the
trustee
in
june
of
1958.
it
began
operating
without
a
control
of
the
court.
in
december
of
1961,
the
trustee
filed
a
petition
for
final
decree.
hearing
was
to
be
held
on
that
in
march
of
1962.
in
february
of
1962,
there
became
a
change
in
the
directors,
the
corporation
had
had
financial
difficulties
and
they
then
entered
into
a
contract
of
sale
with
hennis
freight
lines
for
$1
million
principal
and
interest
included
over
a
period
of
time
of
78
months.
prior
to
the
hearing
on
final
decree,
three
creditors
who
had
come
into
being
subsequent
to
the
reorganized
debtor
taking
over
the
assets
asked
the
court
to
have
the
trustee
retake
the
property
and
assets
alleging
insolvency.
this
took
place
hearing
was
held
and
the
court
vested
the
trustee
with
the
assets
and
property
of
the
debtor
corporation.
investigations
are
placed
to
trustee
then
moved
to
affirm
the
contract
of
sale
with
hennis.
the
court
affirmed
that
contract
in
august
of
1962.
it
took
three
years
for
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
finally
approve
the
sale.
when
it
did
approve
the
sale,
it
entered
a
restriction
upon
the
rights.
now,
the
restriction
have
entered
was
a
sort
of
limited
restriction.
it
did
not
include
a
reduction
of
mileage.
the
original
contract
provided
that
should
the
icc
reduced
the
mileage
then
hennis
would
be
entitled
to
a
reduction.
there
was
dispute
between
the
trustee
and
hennis
as
to
what
the
price
should
be.
we
finally
reached
an
agreement
whereby
the
maximum
amount
of
the
sale
was
to
be
viewed
as
$935,000.000
instead
of
a
million
and
again
is
inclusive
of
the
interest
payable
over
the
same
period
of
time.
then
in
addition,
the
trustee
would
offer
in
the
plan
a
20%
compromise
to
unsecured
creditors
and
any
reduction
of
price
would
rip
down
then
to
hennis.
now,
that
of
course
are
the
facts
right
bearing
up
to
this.
the
plan
then
of
course
was
approved
subsequently
hearing
on
approval
subsequent
hearing
on
conformation,
the
plan
was
confirmed.
the
united
states
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that
is
correct.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
20%
of
their
claims.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
total.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
now,
the
government
is
correct,
this
is
a
plan
for
liquidation.
now
bearing
in
mind
that
it's
a
plan
of
liquidation
something
else
comes
into
play
here
and
that
is
what
would
happen
in
the
event
of
liquidation.
i
would
like
to
point
out
two
matters
before
i
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
it
is
still
a
reorganization
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no
question
about.
it
is
our
view
however
mr.
justice
white
that
in
valuing
the
assets
in
this
case,
we
obviously
cannot
value
the
assets
on
the
basis
of
a
growing
concern
but
only
on
the
basis
of
liquidation
the
value
of
the
assets
which
is
being
transferred.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no.
the
government
takes
its
view
point
but
they
are
entitled
to
absolute
priority
of
the
3466.
we
don't
understand
what
they
mean
by
absolute
priority,
frankly.
absolute
priority
is
set
forth
in
the
case
case
--
case
against
los
angeles
lumber
has
to
do
with
the
relative
priorities
of
the
senior
creditors.
we
contend
that
the
priority
granted
by
--
to
the
united
states
is
incorporated
in
chapter
x,
in
section
199
and
that
is
the
priority
that
they
get.
now,
we
never
contend
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
priority.
they
are.
we
contend
that
they're
getting
it.
now,
we
contend
that
the
major
question
here
is
whether
or
not
section
216
(7)
is
applicable
to
the
united
states.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
because
i
don't
think
in
that
particular
point
that
would
be
fair
and
equitable
because
at
that
particular
point
you
would
be
using
money
which
rightfully
belongs
to
a
senior
creditor
for
the
benefit
of
a
junior
creditor.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
don't
think
that's
quite
true.
well,
i
think
it
must
recognize
in
full
a
priority
and
i
think
this
plan
does
recognize
in
full
a
priority.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that
is
not
quite
true.
the
available
cash
that's
available
comes
in
on
installments.
there
will
be
available
cash.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way
then.
i
don't
believe
that
the
senior
creditor
is
any
more
senior
in
this
particular
program
than
the
other
tax
claimants
though
the
wage
claimant
and
remember
that
in
this
particular
case
it
is
not
just
the
united
states
that
is
being
deferred
there
are
three
other
tax
creditors
that
are
also
being
deferred
and
they
are
being
protected
by
the
asset,
by
the
fund
which
has
been
set
aside.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
there
is
no
priority
in
the
statute.
in
this
particular
point,
i
would
say
that
in
my
view
we
have
to
go
on
what
the
congress
has
enacted
and
it
would
appear
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
in
a
straight
chapter
x,
i
would
say
yes.
i
would
not
disagree.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
yes,
but
i
think
we
must
view
in
the
light
of
liquidation
and
what
the
bankruptcy
priorities
would
be
because
what
the
alternative
to
this
is,
is
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
am
saying
that
the
rules
of
reorganization
are
equitable
rules
and
they
are
flexible
and
that
this
court
has
decided
time
and
again
that
the
rules
in
equity
proceedings
must
be
flexible
depending
upon
the
type
of
situation
and
i
think
we
have
such
a
situation
here.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
think
that
we
follow
them.
i
think
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
my
recollection
is
i
don't
recall
whether
they
cited
the
case
in
them
or
not.
i
didn't
think
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
i
can't
answer
that.
we've
cited
it.
we
think
we
followed
and
we
believe
that
this
actually
fits
the
case
against
los
angeles.
dictum
or
even
not
dictum
really
is
the
policy
and
that
is
equity
proceedings
in
chapter
x
reorganizations
must
be
governed
by
flexible
rules.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
can't
answer
of
course
for
the
judges
of
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i'll
be
happy
to
do
that.
with
your
honest
permission,
i
see
we
have
got
about
30
seconds
left
and
i
will
defer
my
chance
until
the
opening
of
the
recess.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
mr.
chief
justice,
you
asked
before
the
recess
as
to
the
circuit
court's
opinion
with
respect
to
this
case.
in
looking
at
it,
the
only
reason
that
i
can
believe
that
they
did
not
cite
the
case
or
consolidated
proceedings
was
that
they
based
their
decision
one,
on
the
grounds
of
3466
did
not
apply
at
section
199,
216
(7),
and
221
are
the
provisions
of
chapter
x
which
apply.
and
in
talking
in
terms
of
even
the
absolute
priority
rule,
their
view
was
written
on
page
79
of
the
appendix
in
which
they
stated
that
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
approved
plan
contemplates
that
the
united
states
will
be
paid
in
full.
going
on
further
they
cite
we
hold
that
the
trial
court
did
not
urge
in
permitting
lesser
ranking
creditors
to
receive
payment
simultaneously.
under
the
plan,
the
government
does
not
surrender
its
right
to
full
payment.
now,
nowhere
in
the
act
in
fact
nowhere
can
we
find
that
the
government
or
anyone
else
is
entitled
to
cash
payment
in
a
chapter
x
proceeding.
i
think
perhaps,
it
best
can
be
shown
as
to
why
we
think
that
the
absolute
priority
rule
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
place
in
the
act
which
says
they
must
be
paid
before
a
junior
creditor.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
would
state
in
my
view
whether
the
united
states
is
a
senior
creditor
or
a
junior
creditor.
they
are
not
entitled
to
get
paid
before
any
other
creditors
receive
anything.
they
are
entitled
to
be
assured
of
satisfaction
and
ensured
of
their
payment
and
this
is
done
in
this
instance.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
oh!
yes,
i
do.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
don't
have
any
qualms
about
taking
that.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no,
junior
creditors
may
not
take
something
from
the
senior
creditor.
but
in
this
case,
they're
not
taking
anything
from
the
senior
creditor.
in
fact,
they
are
giving
something
up
and
that's
what
i
think
we
have
to
show.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
yes.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i'm
assuming
now
we
have
valued
correctly
and
that
they
are
entitled
to
that
payment.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
would
say
i
find
nothing
wrong
in
terms
of
that.
there
were
other
factors
have
to
be
considered
as
to
other
reasons
for
equitableness.
it's
just
not
the
question
of
whether
they're
going
to
be
paid.
it's
a
question
of
how
it's
going
to
be.
how
the
security
is
fashion?
how
it's
going
to
be
paid
out?
and
that
fact
that
the
creditors
are
paid
out
in
full
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
then
i
say
it's
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
don’t
think
he's
entitled
to
it.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
think
i'm
correct
in
view
of
all
the
other
cases.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
necessarily
but
i
will
stick
by
that
position.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
agree.
i
agree,
that's
why
you
cannot
take
it
out
of
context.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no,
i
think
that's
not
the
historical
reason
to
bear
in
mind.
the
historical
reason
for
the
priority
at
least
3466
was
the
right
of
the
sovereign
to
see
to
it
that
its
taxes
were
obtained
in
order
for
the
benefit
of
everybody.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
i
must
have
misunderstood.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
yes
and
there's
nothing
in
this
case
that
says
they
won't
be
nor
other
cases
where
i
can
see
where
solvency
is
at
issue.
now,
any
true
reorganization
involving
that
situation
that
mr.
justice
white
contemplates
would
necessarily
have
to
have
a
solvent
corporation
coming
out
or
the
senior
creditor
would
be
jeopardized.
let
me
indicate
to
you
the
practicalities
of
this
and
why
i
say
this
is
true
in
this
instance
and
i
can
think
of
many
others
where
it
might
not
be.
this
is
the
plan.
the
plan
provides
for
a
total
payout
of
$925,600.00
under
the
plan,
that's
the
total
cost.
no
one
disagrees
that
the
administration
claims
are
entitled
to
be
paid
first.
there
is
some
disagreement
as
to
the
why
do
the
wages
should
be
paid
first
in
a
true
chapter
x.
there
is
no
such
quarrel
in
a
straight
paragraphs.
this
is
the
united
states
claim
for
$375,000.00.
these
are
the
other
form
or
taxing
authority,
these
three
class
three,
four
and
five
received
are
in
the
same
position
as
the
united
states.
the
first
distribution
indicates
what
happens.
the
united
states
receives
$37,500.00
or
10%.
indiana
then
the
broward
county
and
ohio
also
received
their
10%.
the
miscellaneous
taxes
incidentally
some
30
other
taxing
authorities
received
this
$14,000.00
or
100%.
thus,
these
two
which
would
ordinarily
in
bankruptcy
at
least
have
the
same
established
priority
or
out
in
the
way
in
order
to
solve
the
problem.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that's
correct,
but
in
bankruptcy
that
they
entitle
to
pro
rate
with
the
united
states.
now,
these
are
all
the
general
claims
and
they're
receiving
20%.
it
will
take
under
the
plan.
this
is
how
it
will
go,
at
the
end
of
54
equal
monthly
payments
the
united
states
together
with
the
other
three
will
have
receive
72.3%
of
their
debt.
and
at
the
end
of
the
six
and
a
half
years,
i
suppose
they
have
received
the
whole
100%.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
value
was
there.
i
will
come
to
it
in
a
minute.
what
i
would
like
at
this
particular
point
to
show
the
other
chart
and
what
would
happen
in
the
alternative
in
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
at
the
initial
distribution.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
because
your
honor
the
20%
is
a
compromise
of
their
claims
as
i
will
show
in
liquidation.
they
would
be
entitled
to
anywhere
from
26%
to
36%
depending
upon
the
cost
of
administration
in
the
straight
bankruptcy.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that
is
correct.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that's
all
they
ever
get.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
that's
the
end
of
the
line.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
get
100%.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
yes
sir,
everybody
else
receives
100%
except
the
creditors.
the
stockholders
of
course
are
wipeout.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
let
me
put
it
at
this
way.
there
is
no
question
in
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
as
to
the
capability
of
hennis
to
continue
to
pay
it.
the
testimony
in
the
court
indicates
not
only
that
the
asset
itself
has
increased
in
value.
remember,
that
the
asset
which
is
being
sold
to
hennis
is
still
belonging
to
those
four
creditors
under
a
general
mortgage,
a
security
agreement.
and
their
addition
to
which
hennis
is
shown
by
the
record
is
continually
making
a
profit
and
it
continues
to
grow.
now,
here
is
the
alternative
to
the
plan
because
there
is
no
question
that
in
so
far
as
the
sale
of
this
asset
is
concerned
i
cannot
foresee
how
the
district
court
is
going
to
go
back
on
the
sale
that
took
so
long
to
be
approved.
here's
what
happens
in
bankruptcy.
this
is
the
order
of
priority.
the
administration
cost
$60,000.00
again
100%,
$15,000.00
for
the
wages
a
100%.
remember
now
that
the
united
states
on
the
bankruptcy
shares
equally
with
the
remainder
of
the
taxing
authorities.
they
therefore,
will
receive
at
the
initial
distribution
42.5%
nothing
gets
paid
to
the
general
creditors.
at
the
end
of
january
1975,
in
other
words
about
four
and
a
half
years,
the
united
states
then
gets
paid
in
full.
so
it
takes
four
and
a
half
years
under
bankruptcy
for
the
united
states
and
the
other
taxing
authorities
to
be
paid
in
full.
at
that
point,
the
general
creditors
then
have
30.04%
which
will
be
distributed
to
them
in
the
remaining
two
years.
at
that
point,
that's
what
they're
giving
up.
if
the
administration
expenses
go
up
to
a
maximum
in
our
brief
of
$90,000.00
and
we
don’t
anticipate
it.
that
would
indicate
they
still
get
26%.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
but
i
contend
that
even
with
the
priority
they
are
still
bound
by
section
216
(7)
of
the
act
which
indicates
that
a
dissenting
creditor
can
be
satisfied
by
various
means
and
in
this
case
they
are
satisfied
by
two
means.
one,
the
sale
of
the
property
has
been
sold
with
their
rights
attaching
to
it
and
in
this
case
the
united
states
does
not
have
a
specific
lien
against
it.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
no,
i'm
talking
of
terms
of
216
(7)
and
i'm
talking
in
terms
of
216
(7)
which
is
pointed
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
we're
talking
in
terms
any
plan
of
reorganization
under
this
chapter
shall
include
in
respect
to
creditors
generally
or
some
class
of
them
means
or
provisions
for
overruling
or
modifying
their
rights.
this
216
was
placed
in
there
under
chapter
x
for
the
very
reason
that
we're
here,
a
dissenting
class
of
creditors
could
not
insist
upon
being
paid
out
in
cash
as
the
all
in
equity
receiverships
require.
now,
under
the
all
equity
receivership
there
was
no
way
for
this
to
happen
because
the
senior
creditors
had
to
be
paid
out
in
cash
if
they
insisted.
we
contend
that
that's
what
216
(7)
was
for
and
we
also
believe
that
there
is
nothing
that
excludes
the
united
states
as
a
claimant
from
the
application
of
216.
now,
this
is
where
we
disagree
with
the
government
and
we
contend
that
this
is
true
with
in
other
cases
and
other
security
cases
where
they
are
been
secured
creditors
on
a
particular
piece
of
property.
there
hasn't
been
any
question
that
other
claimants
could
get
paid
and
if
the
security
or
secured
creditor’s
rights
would
be
altered
in
one
of
the
many
ways
of
216
(7).
now,
i
think
the
big
question
here
is
the
interest
question
because
there,
we're
talking
in
terms
of
a
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked.
are
they
getting
a
discounted
value?
i
contend
they
are
not
and
the
reason
i'm
contending
they
are
not
is
because
post
petition
interest
is
not
available
to
tax
claims.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
i
think
it
is.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
i
do.
mr.
sigmund
j.
beck
well,
if
justice
will
allow
me
i
would
say
this;
i
think
the
question
is
one
of
substance
not
a
form.
if
we
were
to
continue
these
proceedings
and
begin
to
payout
as
the
money
has
come
in
then
the
united
states
will
not
receive
interest
and
it
will
receive
its
full
principle
as
we
go
along.
there
is
nothing
as
a
matter
of
fact
even
in
these
first
seven
chapters
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
provide
that
the
united
states
must
be
paid
before
anyone
else.
it
provides
that
there
must
provisions
made
for
the
payment
of
the
united
states.
now,
that
to
me
is
the
real
crux
of
it
when
we’re
talking
in
terms
of
substance
or
form.
i
would
go
further
of
course
and
that
is
this;
the
government
insists
that
3466
applies.
the
circuit
court
held
it
did
not.
i
am
convinced
that
3466
does
not
apply
in
chapter
x
proceedings.
i
believe
that
section
199
provides
the
priority
that
the
legislature
granted
the
united
states.
they
indicated
that
this
was
to
make
certain
of
the
united
states
was
going
to
be
paid
its
taxes
and
custom
duties
and
i
just
don’t
think
that
that's
the
question.
now,
i
don't
even
believe
that
there's
a
conflict
between
u.s.
against
andersen
and
this
case.
i
think
that
the
court
stated
the
difference
and
that
was
in
the
united
states
against
andersen
case.
they
were
talking
about
non-tax
debts.
we're
not
talking
about
non-tax
debts
here.
we're
talking
about
the
priority
granted
by
199
because
all
of
these
taxes.
i
think
the
question
of
the
interest
is
important
only
from
one
reason
if
i
am
correct
that
just
thought
of
these
proceedings
and
continuing
on,
there's
only
one
step
in
the
way
than
the
saper
case
applies
and
the
edens
case
applies
and
the
government
is
not
going
to
be
entitled
to
the
interest
on
its
money.
and
for
that
reason,
i
contend
that
it
isn't
discount
and
true
one
more
thing.
there
isn't
any
question
that
if
interest
has
to
be
paid
the
united
states
then
it
has
to
come
out
of
the
pockets
of
the
general
creditors.
now,
that
to
me
is
the
real
crux
of
it
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court,
i
will
rest.
