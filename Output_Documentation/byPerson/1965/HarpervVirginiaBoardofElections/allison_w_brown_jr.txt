ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
on
appeal
from
a
statutory
three-judge
district
court
which
had
dismissed
the
complaint
of
the
plaintiffs
who
sought
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
and
administration
of
the
virginia
poll
tax
laws
which
require
a
payment
of
certain
sums
of
money
as
a
prerequisite
to
voting
in
state
and
local
elections.
the
plaintiffs
based
their
suit
on
a
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
state
in
its
motion
to
dismiss
and
answer
challen
--
defended
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
of
the
poll
tax
laws
to
challenge
the
con
--
the
standing
of
the
plaintiffs
to
bring
the
suit
on
the
ground
that
by
their
own
admissions,
they
constituted
a
class
which
was
ineligible
to
both
under
virginia
law.
the
plaintiffs
had
alleged
that
though
they
were
qualified
in
every
respect
to
both
under
the
virginia
statutes,
they
lack
the
financial
means
to
pay
the
poll
tax.
and
if
by
their
poverty
they
were
therefore
deprived
the
right
to
vote.
the
state's
argument
was
that
the
plaintiffs
fell
within
the
class
of
persons
known
as
paupers
who
are
disqualified
under
virginia
law
from
voting
as
are
other
classes
such
as
idiots,
insane
persons,
persons
convicted
of
certain
crimes.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
after
hearing
it
on
the
plaintiff's
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
on
the
state's
motion
for
a
motion
to
dismiss.
the
district
court
decided
the
case
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
1937
in
breedlove
v.
suttles
which
had
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
a
georgia
poll
tax
requirement
substantially
similar
to
the
one
in
--
now
existing
in
virginia.
the
court
also
dismissed
the
plaintiff's
challenge
to
the
pauper
disqualification
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
showing
that
it
had
been
applied
to
deprive
the
plaintiffs
of
the
right
to
vote.
and
that
they
therefore
were
without
standing
to
challenge
this
provision
of
the
law.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
this
might
mean
that.
it's
unclear,
sir.
presumably
if
you
can't
pay
the
poll
tax,
you're
a
pauper.
if
you
can
pay
the
poll
tax,
you
wouldn't
be
a
pauper.
the
pauper
provision
has
never
been
tested
and
never
been
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
it
--
well
it
has
never
been
applied
because
there
--
the
poll
tax
has
served
as
an
effective
deterrent
or
bar
to
voting
by
purpose
--
persons
falling
in
that
class
of
virginia.
the
poll
tax
in
the
virginia
is
a
$1.50
payable
three
--
six
months
prior
to
the
election.
a
person
who
has
lived
in
the
state
for
more
than
three
years
must
pay
--
for
three
years
or
more
must
pay
the
tax
cumulatively
to
--
and
if
he
has
never
paid
it,
he
must
--
or
has
paid
it
made
delinquents
payments,
he
must
pay
penalty
and
interest
charges
which
are
added
to
the
poll
tax.
so
that
as
in
the
case
of
these
four
appellants
in
this
proceeding,
in
order
to
register
and
qualify
themselves
to
vote
and
to
cast
their
first
ballot
in
virginia,
none
of
them
have
ever
voted,
they
would
have
to
pay
a
maximum
of
individually
of
$5.01.
two
of
the
plaintiffs
are
husband
and
wife
and
from
their
household
budget
it
would
require
a
payment
of
$10.02
in
order
for
them
to
vote.
the
plaintiff's
first
argument
is
that
this
disqualificaton
or
that
that
--
that
is
that
this
financial
requirement
serves
as
a
bar
to
voting
for
paupers,
indigents,
poor
people,
persons
who
are
of
the
class
which
--
from
which
plaintiffs
--
which
plaintiffs
here
represent.
this
court
in
the
case
decided
last
term,
harman
v.
forssenius
commented
on
the
well-known
fact
that
the
--
the
truck,
the
disenfranchisement
of
the
poor
is
occasioned
by
the
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
the
tax
not
only
disenfranchised
the
persons
without
any
means
but
persons
who
are
below
the
level
of
economic
income
where
there
the
--
the
question
of
paying
a
tax
represents
a
choice
between
the
necessities
of
life,
food,
clothing,
shelter,
medicine,
and
so
forth.
the
census
figures
for
1960
showed
that
28%
of
all
virginia
families
had
incomes
in
1959
of
below
$3,000
a
year.
this
was
the
--
this
is
the
level
that
is
currently
recognized
in
governmental
circles
as
representing
the
--
the
boundary
of
poverty,
the
upper
boundary
of
poverty,
$3,000.
it's
the
figure
which
has
been
accepted
by
the
council
of
economic,
the
president's
council
of
economic
advisers,
the
office
of
economic
opportunity
and
so
forth.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
for
a
family
income,
yes
sir.
the
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
28%
of
all
virginia
families,
yes
sir.
it's
--
in
among
white
families,
the
--
it's
22%
who
have
incomes
below
$3,000
and
among
nonwhite
families,
it's
54%
who
have
incomes
below
$3,000.
so
it's
plain
that
the
--
there
is
a
--
invidious
discrimination
against
poor
people
here
in
the
same
sense
that
this
court
has
previously
spoken
out
in
the
cases
of
griffin
v.
illinois
and
douglas
against
california.
those
cases
were
ones
in
which
the
court
held
in
criminal
proceedings
at
least
that
the
court
could
not
be
discriminated
against.
and
as
the
court
said
in
the
douglas
case
--
in
the
griffin
case,
excuse
me,
"a
state
can
no
more
discriminate
on
account
of
poverty
than
on
account
of
religion,
race,
or
color."
the
court
also
made
clear
in
subsequent
cases,
reynolds
against
sims,
gray
against
sanders,
for
example,
that
this
same
principle
or
the
same
principle
of
economic
discrimination
is
equally
applicable
in
cases
involving
voting
rights;
that
similarly
persons
may
not
be
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
their
class
including
economic
class.
the
discriminatory
scheme
of
the
virginia
laws
also
--
virginia
poll
tax
laws,
also
results
in
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
classifications
of
other
classes
of
persons
who
are
potential
voters
in
the
state.
the
three-year
cumulative
requirement
or
--
and
the
requirement
that
persons
pay
six
months
prior
to
the
election,
all
result
in
disqualifications
of
voters.
in
addition,
there
are
a
number
of
provisions
which
permit
the
exemptions
from
paying
the
tax.
and
there
are
several
classes
of
persons
who
may
vote
in
the
state
without
paying
any
tax.
this
results
in
equal
--
the
denial
of
equal
protection
laws
to
those
persons
who
must
pay
the
tax
vis-à-vis
those
who
do
not
need
to.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
the
exemptions,
sir,
are
members
of
the
armed
forces,
persons
pensioned
by
the
state
for
military
service,
civil
war
veterans,
their
wives
and
widows,
persons
moving
into
the
state
who
are
honorably
discharged
from
the
armed
forces
after
january
1
of
the
year
preceding
the
election.
persons
reaching
21
after
january
1
of
the
year
of
the
election
are
also
exempted.
that
if
these
are
people
who
may
vote
in
the
year
in
which
a
--
election
is
held
but
who
do
not
have
to
show
prior
payment
of
the
poll
tax.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
the
payment
must
be
made
by
--
six
months
prior
to
the
election,
sir.
the
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
the
normal
date
for
billing
and
payment
of
taxes
for
the
majority
of
people
who
pay
it
is
by
december
5th
of
the
year
preceding
the
election.
now,
the
payment
can
also
be
made
at
anytime
up
to
jan
--
up
to
six
months
prior
to
the
time
the
election
will
be
held.
now,
if
the
election
is
one
which
is
held
in
the
early
part
of
the
year,
for
example,
the
--
they
must
have
showed
payment
six
months,
any
six
months
prior
to
the
election.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
the
state
permits
honorably
discharged
servicemen
to
vote
without
having
paid
but
dishonorably
discharged
serviceman
can
still
vote
but
they
have
to
pay
it.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes
sir.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no
sir,
not
all
exempt
--
not
all
veterans,
just
those
who
are
honorably
discharged
with
--
since
january
1
of
the
year
preceding
the
election.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
just
recently
discharged,
just
within
the
year
preceding
the
election.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
just
for
that
one
year,
yes.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well
i'm
not
sure
what
the
reason
is.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
they
are
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
you're
exempt
if
you
have
paid,
if
you
have
become
of
age
since
january
1
of
the
year
of
the
election,
yes.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
correct.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
yes
sir.
in
campbell
against
goode,
a
case
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
had
construed
this
law,
the
court
admitted
that
the
purpose
of
the
poll
tax
was
not
to
limit
the
--
not
to
raise
revenue
but
rather
to
limit
the
right
of
suffrage
to
those
who
took
sufficient
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
state
to
qualify
themselves
to
vote.
and
the
states
read
to
this
court,
it
is
also
a
numerous,
in
several
instances,
repeated
this
same
kind
of
rationale
as
a
basis
for
the
poll
tax.
it
is
stated
for
example
on
pages
43
and
46
of
the
brief
that
the
simplest
and
most
equal
nondiscriminatory
that
the
tax
is,
the
simplest,
most
equal
nondiscriminatory
and
objective
test
of
minimum
intelligence
and
responsibility
that
could
be
reva
--
be
devised.
in
another
point
on
page
38
of
its
brief,
it
refers
to
the
tax
as
an
elementary
and
objective
intelligence
test.
it
all
talks
--
also
talks
about
it
being
a
simple
and
objective
test
of
minimum
capacity
for
ordering
one's
affairs.
now,
we
submit
that
this
type
of
rationale
simply
does
not
bear
scrutiny
or
it
is
plain
that
if
these
are
--
are
the
very
nature
of
a
tax,
poor
people
are
going
to
be
discriminated
against
and
is
going
to
be
disqualified
for
voting
and
this
--
their
failure
to
pay
the
tax
is
not
in
anyway
established
by
--
it
does
not
in
any
way
establish
their
lack
of
responsibility
as
citizens
due
to
their
lack
of
intelligence.
the
exemptions
also
suggest
that
the
tax
in
no
way
is
a
test
of
intelligence
or
responsibility.
i
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
if
there
is
a
provision
of
the
tax
--
of
the
state
code,
section
24-129,
which
has
not
been
referred
to
in
any
of
the
briefs
but
which
permits
a
member
of
a
--
a
person
to
have
his
tax
paid
by
a
member
of
his
household
or
his
immediate
family.
thus,
as
it's
true
in
many
families,
the
person
who
pays
the
bills
pays
the
tax
for
the
other
members
of
the
family,
the
spouse
for
example.
therefore,
the
state
has
no
way
of
knowing,
having
any
knowledge
about
this
minimum
intelligence
or
responsibility
of
the
person
who
has
a
tax
paid
for
him.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
unless
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
member
of
his
family
or
household
because
that
has
to
be
blood
relative.
now
the
state
argues
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
voting.
this
is
one
of
its
principal
defense
--
defenses
to
voting
rights.
it
argues
this
on
the
basis
of
construction
of
the
language
of
article
2,
section
1
of
the
constitution
which
appears
to
or
which
does
states
--
the
states
may
establish
the
qualifications
for
voting.
however,
we
state,
to
serve
one
that
the
poll
tax
is
not
a
qualification
in
the
--
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
word
and
that
therefore
it
should
not
be
barred
that
is
a
decision
holding
it
unconstitutional
is
not
barred
by
this
language.
secondly,
we
submit
that
this
court
has
really
dispose
in
large
measure
of
the
state's
argument
on
this
court
because
in
the
cases
decided
last
term
carrington
against
rash
involving
the
texas
serviceman,
louisiana
versus
the
united
states
and
in
--
of
the
earlier
case
of
lassiter
versus
northampton
board
of
elections,
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
fourteenth
amendment,
at
the
very
least,
does
apply
to
voting
rights
and
that
these
voting
requirements
will
be
subject
--
subjected
to
examination
in
light
of
the
requirements
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
not
only,
therefore,
does
the
equal
protection
clause
established
a
basis
for
this
court's
decision
but
we
further
believe
that
voting
here
must
also
be
looked
at
as
being
one
that
had
--
we
believe
that
the
due
process
clause
demands
the
same
result
that
is
that
the
poll
tax
is
unconstitutional
as
a
prerequisite
to
voting.
for
example,
as
this
court
has
made
clear
the
very
fundamental
and
basic
and
essential
nature
of
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
vote,
therefore,
may
not
be
--
may
not
be
taken
away,
may
not
be
impaired
by
requirements
which
have
no
relevancy
to
the
maintenance
of
--
to
the
state's
interest
rather
in
having
an
informed
electorate
and
having
efficient
and
well
run
electoral
process.
we
believe
that
the
first
amendment
provides
the
basis
for
the
court
to
examine
the
nature
of
voting.
we
believe
that
voting
is
similar,
for
example,
to
other
rights
that
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
it's
a
--
it's
a
form
of
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
we
believe
that
it
is
of
the
nature
of
rights
that
are
presently
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
we
beli
--
well
it's
not
as
spelled
out
in
the
first
amendment.
we
think
that
it
is
or
it
is
of
the
same
nature
as
other
rights
which
have
been
granted
protection
under
the
first
amendment,
rights
set
forth
in
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
recent
years
which
fill
out
and
expand
on
the
nature
of
the
first
amendment
or
give
it
meaning
if
we
will,
significantly.
the
right
to
vote
is
a
form
of
political
expression
which
--
and
the
other
rights
by
the
--
as
protected
by
the
first
amendment
have
little
meaning,
for
example,
if
the
person
is
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
now
the
state
argues
that
the
right
to
vote
may
not
be
compared
with
other
rights
protected
by
the
first
amendment
because
it
is
subject
to
certain
limitations
and
restrictions.
but
this
is
true
of
other
rights
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
state
establishes
21
as
the,
in
many
states,
18
and
others
as
the
basis
--
as
the
minimum
age
for
voting.
but
this
is
no
different
than
saying
that
other
rights
may
not
be
--
certain
minimal
conditions
have
to
be
met
in
as
a
prerequisite
for
asserting
and
exercising
other
rights.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
--
the
court.
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
virginia
is
not
the
only
state
with
a
poll
tax.
there
are
three
--
there
are
four
other
states
in
the
united
states
that
have
it.
three
of
these
are
in
the
south
and
one
of
them
is
the
state
of
vermont.
vermont
--
the
vermont
poll
tax
law
has
a
provision
which
suggests
that
the
court's
ruling
in
here
in
the
basis
on
which
the
board,
the
court
makes
its
ruling
may
have
ramifications.
the
poll
tax
in
vermont,
for
example,
ranges
from
a
minimum
of
$3.50
to
a
maximum
of
$18
as
a
prerequisite
to
vote.
in
addition,
there
is
a
$5
old-age
assistance
tax
which
is
tucked
on
to
that
which
must
also
be
paid
as
a
prerequisite
to
vote.
now,
this
is
not
in
all
elections
but
only
in
town
meetings,
town
elections,
and
school
district
elections
in
that
state.
the
vermont
tax
unlike
that
in
virginia
has
an
exemption
for
persons
“actually
poor”,
also
for
persons
receiving
old-age
assistance.
we,
therefore,
have
suggested
that
the
basis
for
the
court's
ruling
will
have
significance
here
and
that
the
equal
protection
clause
alone
for
example
if
the
--
if
the
basis
for
the
court's
ruling
is
at
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
because
in
virginia
because
it
deprives
paupers
of
the
right
to
vote,
the
poor
persons
have
the
right
to
vote.
this
may
not
reach
the
type
of
tax
that
exists
in
vermont
or
the
kind
of
tax
which
could
be
enacted
in
virginia
or
some
other
state
that
is
if
they
were
to
incorporate
an
exemption
for
paupers.
now,
we
believe
that
even
a
pauper
exemption
if
were
established
is
a
--
one
had
to
take
it
as
a
prerequisite
to
voting
would
be
an
unconstitutional
irrational
burden
on
the
exercise
of
the
franchise.
but
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
any
--
any
tax
even
if
there
is
a
pauper
extension
--
exemption
is
unconstitutional
because
it's
irrelevant.
and
as
in
the
case
of
murdock
against
pennsylvania,
for
example,
it
constitutes
a
burden
or
a
restraint,
a
prior
restraint,
a
suppression
on
the
exercise
of
a
fundamental
right.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
we
believe
that
breedlove
is
--
has
really
lost
all
meaning
and
significance
in
view
of
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
applying
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
voting
rights
and
in
view
of
the
rights
of
paupers
which
the
court
has
--
or
the
poor
persons
which
the
court
has
for
it
shown
that
it
must
be
protected
in
the
douglas
and
griffin
cases.
we
believe,
therefore,
that
breedlove
should
be
overruled.
we
just
don't
see
how
it
can
be
held,
it
can
be
--
how
it
can
be
looked
upon
as
consistent
with
the
current
state
of
the
law
as
it's
been
explicated
by
this
court.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
we
--
i
think
it
should
be
overruled.
i
think
--
i
don't
see
how
the
court
can
find
the
basis
for
distinguishing
it
frankly
because
there's
no
question
with
what
the
rules
or
rather
the
issues
which
are
presently
before
the
court
were
presently
--
or
presented
to
the
court
in
breedlove.
and
the
reading
of
that
decision
just
is
impossible
to
reconcile
it
with
current
thinking.
finally,
i
would
like
to
touch
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
since
what
sir?
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
there
may
be
exemption.
there's
something
of
that
sort
have
been
changed
but
not
substantially.
finally,
i
would
like
to
touch
momentarily
on
the
final
issue
--
the
second
issue
rather
which
we
raised
in
this
--
which
has
become
concurrent
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
one
involving
the
so-called
pauper
disqualification.
this
--
the
district
court
refused
to
hold
this
provision
unconstitutional
on
the
ground
that
it
had
been
not
shown
in
the
proceeding
that
it
had
been
applied
to
prevent
these
appellants
or
any
other
persons
from
voting.
our
answer
to
that
is,
one,
there
was
never
any
need
to
apply
it
because
the
poll
tax
served
as
a
--
as
a
bar
to
voting
by
persons
who
are
poor
or
paupers.
secondly,
we
believe
this
provision
should
be
held
unconstitutional
because
it
is
a
self-enforcing
provision.
it
is
a
prior
restraint
on
the
exercise
that
it
would
be
franchise.
the
state
--
the
--
any
person
who
considers
himself
of
low
economic
means
is
and
who
is
aware
of
his
disqualification
is
simply
not
going
to
show
up
at
the
polls.
so
it's
a
prior
restraint
which
should
be
invalidated.
and
as
long
as
it
stands
on
the
books,
it
is
a
--
something
that
--
that
is
intolerable.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
only
to
the
extent
the
attorney
general
in
this
proceeding
has
asserted
that
the
plaintiffs
fall
or
the
appellants
here
fall
within
the
class
but
there
has
not
been
any
--
any
kind
of
other
--
other
explication
of
what
it
means.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
no.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
they're
just
people
who
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
and
they
have
brought
this
case
up.
they've
alleged
that
there
are
two
provisions,
the
state
law,
which
barred
them
from
voting
and
it
would
be
hardship
on
them
to
only
have
this
case
ruled
on
in
a
piecemeal
basis.
for
the
court
to
hold
the
poll
tax
perhaps
is
unconstitutional
but
to
leave
this
other
bar
standing.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
so.
i
believe
that
they
are
not
a
relevant
qualification.
they
bear
no
relevance
to
the
--
to
the
requirements
of
a
sound
electoral
machinery
and
that
they
--
under
the
due
process
clause,
they
would
be
an
unconstitutional
burden.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that
i
think
might
raise
another
question
whether
--
where
property
is
going
to
be
--
have
an
encumbrance
put
on
it,
for
example,
as
might
be
the
case
if
--
if
obligations
are
incurred,
financial
obligations.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
has
asserted.
he
asserted
that
in
his
motion
to
dismiss
and
in
his
answer
and
he
asserts
it,
has
continued
to
assert
it
at
that
proceeding.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
to
correct
the
record
on
one
matter
that
was
mentioned
by
counsel
for
the
state
yesterday
in
response
to
mr.
justice
fortas'
question
as
to
whether
state
elections
and
federal
elections
are
held
at
the
same
time
in
virginia.
i
think
the
statements
spoke
on
that
score.
there
have
been
since
1964
when
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
became
effective,
there
have
been
federal
referendum
questions
on
the
ballot,
at
the
same
time,
that
the
federal
elections
were
held,
elections
for
federal
officers.
and
in
1964
for
example,
when
the
presidential
election
was
held,
voters
who
had
not
paid
the
poll
tax
were
eligible
to
vote
in
the
federal
election,
but
voters
who
wished
to
vote
on
the
state
referendum
question
which
had
given
a
constitutional
amendment
had
to
show
that
they
had
paid
poll
taxes.
and
this
will
happen
again
in
this
year
for
example,
there
are
county
elections,
in
some
counties
in
the
state
of
virginia
and
these
will
also
hopefully
held
on
the
same
day
in
november
that
the
elections
will
be
held
for
united
states'
senator
and
congressmen.
there
are
--
i
point
out
also
elections
that
occur
at
different
dates
in
virginia.
for
example
there
would
be
municipal
election
the
second
tuesday
in
june.
there
were
also
--
there
was
a
special
elections
held
yesterday
for
example
in
the
city
of
alexandria,
across
the
riverport
to
fill
a
seat
on
the
city
counsel.
so
these
elections
are
coming
up
all
the
time
and
every
time
--
everyday,
the
poll
tax
remains
in
effect.
it
continues
to
disenfranchise
voters
and
people
who
would
like
to
express
their
views
on
the
governmental
affairs
in
the
state.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
the
position
of
the
appellants
in
the
--
yes
sir,
in
the
harper
case,
is
based
solely
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
both
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses.
now,
on
that
score,
i
would
like
to
reiterate
or
mention
again
a
case
which
we
have
cited
in
our
briefs
but
which
was
not
spoken
out
yesterday,
and
that
is
the
murdock,
the
case
of
murdock
against
pennsylvania
where
this
court
said
that
a
state
may
not
impose
a
charge
for
the
enjoyment
of
rights
guaranteed
by
the
bill
of
rights.
we
submit
that
the
bill
of
rights
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
a
marriage
license
is
questionable
whether
this
is
a
type
of
right
that
is
encompassed
within
the
first
amendment
with
all
due
respect
to
the
griswold
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
yes,
i
am
very
familiar
with
it.
well,
that
might
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that
might
create
another
--
another
case.
what
we're
talking
about
in
the
--
what
the
murdock
case
dealt
with
incidentally
was
the
flat
tax
and
that's
where
the
court
said
it
proposed
a
prior
restraint
on
the
exercise
of
that
freedom.
it
was
the
flat
tax,
unrelated
to
any
measurable
matter.
now
the
--
we
submit
that
the
--
to
this
court
to
give
the
fullest
expression
and
meaning
to
the
fundamental
thing
--
the
characteristics
upon
which
this
republican
form
of
government
is
based
necessitate
a
consideration
of
the
first,
the
voting
rights
in
relation
to
the
first
amendment.
the
court
has
--
to
take
a
doctrinaire
rigid
view
of
article
i
section
2
and
say
that
the
right
to
vote
flows
only
from
the
states
and
exists
only
by
the
grace
of
the
states,
it
seems
to
us
--
is
to
do
an
injustice
to
our
democracy.
a
democratic
form
of
government
as
every
school
child
knows
means
that
a
person
has
a
right
to
vote.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that
would
be
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
that's
the
very
least
guaranteed
clause,
sir.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
the
guaranteed
clause,
article
4
section
4.
it
seems
to
me
this
is
the
absolute
--
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
republican
form
of
the
government.
similarly,
the
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
i
believe
luther
and
borden
has
been
somewhat
detracted
from
by
the
ruling
in
the
baker
v.
carr
sir.
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
his
decision
there
talked
--
spoke
of
luther
v.
borden
and
how
when
there
are
measurable
standards,
identifiable
standards
elsewhere
in
the
constitution
that
the
guarantee
clause
does
provide
a
fundamental
jurisdictional
phases
for
a
court
to
consider
the
question
of
the
republican
form
of
government.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
this
would
--
i
would
suppose
it'd
be
a
question
i
can't
--
i
can't
answer
the
question
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
do
not
know
sir.
it
seems
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
would
suppose
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
it's
a
hard
question.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
it's
a
hard
question.
i
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
but
certainly
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
the
republican
form
of
government
certainly
subsumes
the
participation
by
the
electorate
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
this
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
would
say,
this
would
be
a
very
difficult
question
sir,
but
i
will
say
that
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
certainly
the
executive
--
the
chief
executive
officer
and
the
executive
--
the
principal
officers
in
the
executive
department
and
certainly
those
in
the
legislative
department
would
have
to
be
elected.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
would
suppose
the
court
would
have
to
consider
what
are
the
essentials
of
the
republican
form
of
the
government?
what
are
the
things
that
needs
--
that
have
to
be
present.
but
it
would
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
know
that
and
i
believe
that
that
is
inconsistent
with
what
we
consider
to
be
the
true
meaning
of
the
republican
form
of
government.
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
but
sir,
in
the
--
this
court
has
not
hesitated
on
numerous
occasions
to
give
the
full
meaning
and
scope
to
the
first
amendment
and
the
guarantees
of
the
bill
of
rights
by
reading
into
the
first
amendment
matters
which
had
not
explicitly
mentioned
there.
it
did
it
twice
last
term
in
the
griswold
and
the
la
mont
cases.
it
had
--
concerning
the
right
of
privacy
and
marriage,
the
right
to
receive
communications
as
well
as
to
express
them.
the
rights
of
travel
have
been
read
in
to
the
first
amendment.
the
right
to
earn
a
living
and
--
ms.
allison
w.
brown,
jr.
i
am
sir,
yes.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
--
as
this
court
has
said
that
without
the
right
to
vote
other
rights
that
citizens
have
are
illusory.
certainly,
they
are
illusory.
they
are
--
they
can
be
abolished
at
will
at
the
will
of
person
[inaudible]
people
have
no
control,
the
people
are
deprived
of
this
right
to
vote
and
it
is
to
negate
and
stultify
and
to
cripple
the
true
meaning
of
the
republican
and
democratic
form
of
government,
if
you
will,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
say
that
this
right
to
vote
derives
only
from
the
states.
so
we
urge
the
court
to
provide
the
protection
afforded
by
the
first
amendment.
