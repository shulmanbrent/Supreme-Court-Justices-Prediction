mr.
winston
l.
livingston
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
members
of
the
court.
prior
to
commencing
argument,
i
should
like
also
to
make
reference
to
factual
matters
that
was
touched
on
in
an
argument
by
the
petitioner.
the
record
does
affirmatively
show
that
mr.
doyle
was
not
a
member
or
agent
or
an
officer
of
the
union.
that's
on
page
50
and
60
of
the
record.
in
conjunction
with
this,
the
record
also
affirmatively
shows
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
at
the
administrative
level
did
conduct
a
full
scale
investigation.
the
affidavit
of
mr.
bilbri(ph)
in
the
record
shows
the
extent
of
the
investigation.
they
even
checked
the
original
membership
card
of
mr.
doyle
to
ascertain
that
he
had
not
been
a
member
for
almost
a
year.
the
third
point
discussed
by
petitioner
which
i
believe
needs
clarifying
such
an
effect
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
linn,
as
an
individual
has
the
right
to
file
a
charge.
section
10(b)
of
the
act
starts
out
when
it
is
charged
and
the
board
has
said
that
any
individual
has
the
right
to
file
a
charge
so
that
mr.
linn
did
have
access
to
the
procedures
and
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
although
the
issue
in
this
case
is
narrow,
i
think
it's
important
to
the
furtherance
of
our
national
labor
policy
cannot
be
under
estimated.
we
would
define
the
issue
in
the
following
terms.
shall
a
further
exception
to
the
preemption
doctrine
stated
in
san
diego
building
trades
versus
garmon
be
made
in
cases
of
claim
defamation
uttered
in
the
context
of
a
labor
dispute.
respondents
urge
that
no
such
exception
should
be
made.
it
is
not
necessary
nor
even
desirable.
on
the
other
hand,
any
such
exception
would
create
havoc
and
confusion
in
this
area
which
has
so
many
times
been
described
as
an
area
of
delicate
balance
between
the
competing
interest
of
the
federal
government
and
our
national
labor
policy
and
those
of
the
state.
we
believe
the
exception
urged
by
respondent
would
destroy
the
effect
of
garmon
which
has
been
so
successfully
followed
by
the
lower
courts
since
its
decision
in
1959.
the
exception
proposed
by
respondent
would
open
a
wide
area
of
conflict
between
the
federal
labor
policy
and
the
policy
of
the
50
different
states
relating
to
defamatory
statements
in
this
labor
relations
field.
respondents
cannot
accept
either
as
workable,
the
limited
exception
proposed
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
respondents
assert
in
its
brief
that
garmon
was
not
the
end
of
the
preemption
road.
respondents
believe
it
was,
is,
or
should
be
the
end
of
the
preemption
road.
i
think
just
a
brief
review
of
the
background
of
all
of
the
preemption
cases
that
gave
rise
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
decision
in
garmon
would
throw
a
light
on
the
reason
garmon
--
the
garmon
rule
was
enunciated
and
the
reason
it
has
proved
so
workable
since
that
day.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
noted
that
the
preemption
issue
there
was
a
variant
of
a
familiar
field.
the
notes
that
preemption
began
with
allen
bradley
versus
wisconsin
board
and
was
greatly
intensified
by
litigation
which
flew
from
the
enactment
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
and
the
preemption
issue
was
brought
before
this
court
in
almost
a
score
of
cases
during
the
decade
immediately
preceding
the
garmon
decision.
thus
there
were
a
large
number
of
cases
stating
specific
areas
of
preemption
and
also
delimiting
state
areas
of
conduct.
the
titles
and
propositions
of
these
cases
are
familiar
to
every
labor
law
practitioner
and
i'm
sure
to
this
court
hill
versus
florida,
uaw
versus
o'
brien,
garner
versus
teamsters,
weber
versus
anhieser
bush,
and
a
host
of
others.
now
in
the
garmon
decision,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
hold
together
this
almost
score
of
preemption
cases.
he
reconciled
them
and
concluded
that
over
the
years,
a
clear
pattern
had
evolved
from
the
previous
decisions.
and
he
stated
that
this
--
that
with
garmon,
with
the
decision
in
garmon,
it
may
safely
be
claimed
that
this
long
series
of
adjudications
have
hope
translated
into
concreteness,
be
consistently
applied
principles
which
decide
this
case.
what
was
the
clear
pattern?
the
familiar
test
of
an
activity
that
is
arguably
subject
to
section
7
or
section
8
of
the
act.
this
clear
pattern
recognized
only
two
exceptions.
one,
the
-–
then
just
preceding
decision
in
the
gonzales
case
relating
matters
of
peripheral
concern,
the
other
was
in
those
cases
which
touched
so
deeply
and
local
feelings
that
state
should
be
allowed
to
intervene
i.e.
conduct
marked
by
violence
and
eminent
press
of
the
public
court.
it's
a
very
simple
rule.
it
has
proved
very
workable.
to
use
a
colloquial
expression
was
the
greatest
thing
since
the
bow
and
arrow
to
practitioners
in
the
field
and
to
the
judges
of
the
lower
courts.
i
think
only
a
review
of
all
of
the
cases
pending
in
the
lower
court
on
this
subject
in
this
area
of
libel
showed
that
the
federal
court
would
--
or
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts,
the
judges
that
have
been
called
upon
to
decide
where
their
libel
and
slander
occurring
in
a
labor
dispute
is
preempted
by
garmon
almost
unanimously
hold
in
applying
garmon
that
it
is
preempted.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
no
sir,
i
did
not.
i
think
that
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
because
it
gets
into
the
area
of
the
physical
touching
violence.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
well
it
would
be
a
touching
tort
as
distinguished
from
this
case
a
non-touching.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
i
make
that
incurred
of
it.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
well,
i
think
the
important
thing
too
in
that
situation
would
be
the
accidental
kicking
of
another
in
the
chin
would
have
no
relevance
or
relationship
to
labor
relations
policy
and
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
that
is
correct
but
i
would
not
--
i
would
not
say
that
such
would
be
preempted
by
garmon
because
of
the
distinctions
which
i
have
just
stated.
the
substance
of
this
point
is
that
the
trial
judges
at
all
level
understand
garmon
and
they
know
how
to
apply
it.
and
without
exception,
when
they
do
apply
it
they
hold
that
garmon
preempts
all
activity
or
conduct
that
does
not
involve
violence
or
eminent
threats
to
the
public
peace.
let's
say
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
the
myer's
decision
however
held
that
garmon
did
not
apply
to
this
type
of
action.
on
the
other
hand
the
supreme
courts
of
arizona
and
alaska
had
held
garmon
applied
to
this
type
of
action.
as
the
district
judge
in
this
case
had
no
trouble
in
applying
garmon
finding
preemption,
the
court
of
appeals
likewise.
i
don't
believe
that
anyone,
any
party
can
seriously
dispute
that
garmon
is
the
case
to
be
considered
in
this
context.
so
the
first
question
is
the
activity
of
mr.
doyle
arguably
protected
by
section
7
are
prohibited
by
section
8.
i
believe
this
point
is
so
clear
that
it
does
not
require
any
extended
discussion.
here
was
an
employee
appealing
to
fellow
employees
to
support
the
union,
to
support
self
organizational
efforts
during
an
organizing
campaign.
the
statements
were
certainly
relevant.
the
petitioner
never
really
challenged
that
it
was
not
protected
or
prohibited
until
filing
a
brief
in
this
case.
the
government
concedes
that
if
garmon
applies,
the
statements
would
be
protected
under
section
7
of
the
act
because
if
the
statements
were
true,
then
clearly
such
statements
would
be
protected,
therefore,
it
is
arguably
so.
we
further
submit
that
the
trial
court
which
made
the
statement
that
it
was
prohibited
by
section
8
was
also
correct.
it
could
arguably
be
prohibited
by
section
8.
the
petitioners
recognized
this.
i
should
i
say
the
petitioners
but
the
petitioner's
employer
recognized
this
by
filing
a
charge
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
alleging
a
violation
of
section
8(b)
1(a)
which
is
the
section
prohibiting
a
union
or
others
from
interfering
with
restraining
or
coercing
employees
in
the
exercise
of
their
section
7
rights.
the
other
point
which
must
be
considered
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
no
sir
but
i
do
suggest
that
as
another
part
of
the
argument
that
in
many
instances,
the
institution
of
a
libel
suit
such
as
this
suit
may
violate
the
act
because
it
may
have
a
coercive
effect
upon
a
union's
organizational
right
or
during
the
course
of
the
labor
dispute.
a
small
union
with
very
limited
funds
that
is
faced
with
a
--
half
a
million
or
a
million
dollar
lawsuit
such
as
in
this
case
may
very
well
conclude
that
it
will
bargain
away
any
right
to
organize
the
employees
for
the
company
dropping
the
lawsuit
or
dismissing
it.
it
may
also
scare
the
employees
to
where
they
will
be
afraid
to
engage
in
any
activity.
and
i
might
say
--
state
this
parenthetically
--
earlier
mr.
doyle
mentioned
quite
frequently,
he
apparently
still
is
in
the
case.
although
this
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
i
thought
it
might
be
of
some
interest
after
the
charge
was
filed
and
the
suit
was
filed
against
him
and
he
was
served,
he
went
back
to
england
and
has
never
returned.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
may
have
been
the
result
of
the
lawsuit
but
the
fact
is
that
it
is
mentioned
so
that
it
will
explain
why
no
further
action
has
been
taken
with
respect
to
doyle
in
the
lower
courts.
i
might
add
there
too,
this
question
has
come
up
that
i
say
no
distinction
between
doyle
as
an
individual
and
the
union
as
an
entity
with
respect
to
the
protection
from
such
suits
because
the
employees
of
section
7
have
the
right
to
engage
in
these
activities.
therefore
there
should
be
no
distinction
between
the
suit
against
the
employee
or
the
suit
against
the
union.
much
is
made
in
the
brief
of
petitioner
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest.
there's
such
a
compelling
state
interest
and
the
respondent's
conduct
that
the
state
should
be
free
to
interfere
with
the
federal
policy.
again,
the
conduct
of
respondents,
if
true,
was
all
concerned
with
an
organizing
guide.
i
think
that
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
we
are
here
today
deciding
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
not
fact
as
suggested
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
or
the
facts
as
suggested
in
briefs
filed
by
other
amicus
curiae
in
this
case.
this
is
the
run
of
the
mill
case
that
comes
along
in
a
libel
and
slander
situation
in
a
labor
dispute.
and
i
think
it's
helpful
to
believe
at
a
point
a
little
bit.
petitioner
was
a
resident
and
a
citizen
of
ohio.
he
wasn't
even
a
citizen
of
michigan.
his
only
relationship
to
michigan,
it
was
one
of
several
northwestern
states
that
he
--
in
which
he
exercised
supervisory
control.
it's
part
of
his
duty
to
prevent
and
to
resist
the
organizational
efforts
of
his
employee.
part
of
his
job,
he
is
the
manager.
he
was
an
employee
of
pinkerton
and
doyle
was
an
employee
of
pinkerton.
and
it
was
doyle
who
wrote
the
letter
to
fellow
employees.
it
is
rather
crude.
it
doesn't
even
appear
on
union
stationary.
very
crude
but
it
is
not
such
as
to
shot
conscience.
i
have
seen
and
heard
many
worse
statements
that
were
contained
in
this
leaflet.
it
does
not
even
impute
the
commission
of
any
specific
crime
other
than
the
submission
of
false
information
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
there
is
no
hint
of
violence
or
threat
to
the
peace.
what
overwriting
state
interest
is
involved
then
to
justify
michigan
taking
this
action
away
from
the
national
labor
relations
board?
petitioner's
only
answer
is
that
the
individual
has
an
interest
to
protect
his
reputation.
and
the
government's
answer
is
that
the
protection
of
a
citizen
against
damage
to
its
reputation
is
the
traditional
concern
and
responsibility
of
the
states.
now
the
individual
of
course
has
an
interest
in
this
reputation.
but
just
what
interest
does
the
state
have?
what
compelling
interest
does
a
state
have?
the
only
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
is
that
the
state's
interest
is
the
individual's
interest.
they're
the
same
because
there
is
no
overwriting
possibility
of
violence.
now
of
course,
it
has
been
suggested
in
one
of
the
briefs
or
two
that
defamatory
statements
may
tend
to
provoke
a
breach
of
the
peace
but
there
are
no
proofs
to
support
this.
at
the
point,
defamation
reaches
the
violent
stage.
for
example,
defamatory
words
uttered
on
a
picket
line
against
non-obstructive
has
been
held
to
constitute
such
eminent
danger
to
the
peace
as
to
justify
state
interference.
the
youngdahl
versus
rainfair,
i
think
this
was
also
involved
in
the
meadowmoor
dairies
case,
the
earlier
case.
and
injunctions
have
been
sustained
against
being
calling
as
well
as
others.
so
if
defamation
reaches
the
point
that
it
constitutes
a
danger
to
the
domestic
peace,
the
states
may
act
under
the
present
garmon
rule.
i
believe
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
myers
case
in
pennsylvania,
sums
up
respondent's
position
better
than
i
could
rephrase
it.
in
view
of
the
lack
of
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
state's
interest
in
defamation
is
as
great
as
the
state's
interest
in
physical
violence.
i
prefer
to
follow
the
well
reasoned
federal
and
state
authorities
to
the
effect
that
state
based
actions
for
defamation
arising
out
of
the
labor
dispute
are
precluded
because
regulation
of
the
conduct
in
question
is
subject
to
the
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
over
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings.
in
summary,
on
this
point,
petitioner
and
the
government
then
equate
the
individual's
interest
in
protecting
his
reputation
with
the
state's
interest
and
maintaining
domestic
peace.
they
are
not
the
same.
let
us
consider
for
a
moment
the
potential
areas
of
conflict.
in
this
case,
if
we
were
to
allow
this
defamation
action
to
be
maintained.
i
think
of
the
outset,
we
should
note,
that
there
is
not
one
single
irrelevant
statement
made
in
this
leaflet.
there's
no
allegation
of
any
sexual
misconduct
on
the
part
of
mr.
linn
or
any
other
grave
type
of
defamation.
everything
pertains
to
the
employment
relationship.
when
mr.
linn
first
started
this
suit,
his
peace
suit
for
$500,000
damages,
now
no
special
damages
were
alleged,
didn't
allege,
he
lost
his
job
or
that
he
was
--
that
he
suffered
in
the
other
pecuniary
loss.
then
because
the
plaintiff
in
the
proceedings
below
had
not
made
the
necessary
allegations
respecting
citizenship
upon
amendment
to
correct
this
defect
by
leave
of
court,
the
damages
were
suddenly
increased
to
a
million
dollars.
again,
no
reason
given
why
mr.
linn's
damages
should
suddenly
jump
from
$500,000
to
one
million
dollars.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
well,
i
believe
that
it
shows
a
different
motive,
mr.
justice
black.
and
that
is
the
background
for
my
argument
here.
nlrb,
might
find
as
in
fact
it
did
in
this
case
and
i'm
talking
about
the
administrative
determination
that
was
made
by
the
investigative
machinery.
and
i
think
before
we
knot
the
effect
of
this
determination,
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
this
is
the
same
type,
this
is
the
same
machinery
that
congress
provided
should
be
set
up
for
determining
the
processing
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
and
complaints.
so
that
nlrb
found
that
the
union
was
not
responsible
for
the
publication
of
this
--
these
leaflets
or
the
distribution
of
it.
on
the
other
hand,
a
jury
might
find
that
the
union
was
responsible.
the
effect,
of
course,
in
this
instance,
would
be
to
undermine
the
prestige
and
the
authority
of
the
national
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
as
i
read
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
there
had
been
no
hearing
--
no
sir,
the
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
it
is
not
the
usual
type
of
letter
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
yes
but
--
but
to
refer
--
your
honor,
further
down,
there
is
a
specific
finding
such
employee
was
not
an
officer
or
member
of
the
charge
union
is
there
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
that
he
was
acting
as
an
agent
of
such
union.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
no
sir,
i
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
right,
i
thought
that
i
had
preface
my
remarks
with
the
statement
that
it
should
not
--
it
does
not
have
the
status
of
a
board
determination.
it
is
merely
the
result
of
the
board's
investigation
but
nevertheless,
it
is
the
type
of
investigation
which
congress
created
for
determining
the
merits
of
these
matters.
and
of
course
the
general
council
has
final
say
with
respect
to
the
processing
of
unfair
labor
practice
complaints.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
we
believe
that
if
there
are
statements
made
during
an
organizing
drive
which
are
irrelevant
to
the
dispute
then
libel
actions
could
be
maintained.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
no
sir.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
no
sir,
we
suggest
that
the
government
or
that
the
garmon
has
have
arguably
subject
is
irrelevance
test
and
therefore
would
permit
libel
and
slander
actions
in
certain
gross
situations
such
as
i
refer
to
in
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
yes
sir,
i
believe
under
garmon
that
such
an
action
could
be
or
would
be
subject
to
the
libel
action.
and
other
allegations
of
the
type
which
there
are
no
relationship
to
the
purpose
of
the
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
pardon?
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
in
--
yes
sir,
i
think
that
it
would
be
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
well
i
don't
go
on
the
basis
of
seriousness,
sir.
my
argument
is
directed
not
to
the
seriousness
but
to
the
relevance
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
regardless
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
well
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
i
would
--
i
misused
and
i
beg
your
pardon
that
the
term
gross,
i
was
referring
to
some
irrelevant
type
of
accusation
made
during
an
organizing
campaign.
sexual
misconduct
that
has
no
bearing,
the
robbing
of
a
bank,
a
draft
dodger
during
world
war
i
which
would
have
nothing
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
well
i
would
say
that
in
that
case
that
there
would
be
--
that
it
would
be
relevant
to
the
right
of
the
union
and
the
obligation
of
the
union
and
the
ability
of
the
union
to
represent
the
employees.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
in
that
case,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
--
there
would
be
the
relevance
because
the
employer
is
not
charged
with
a
trust
or
a
responsibility
to
represent
employees.
it's
on
the
other
side
of
the
defense.
so
i
would
draw
a
distinction
between
those
two.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
yes,
sir.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
well
that
is
--
that
is
very
true
and
i
think
is
the
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
well,
i
beg
to
disagree.
our
position
is
that
garmon
should
be
applied
all
the
way.
we
merely
refer
to
the
two
very
irrelevant
examples
stated
in
the
brief
for
the
government
as
afforded
some
possible
relief
in
the
state
courts
because
it
is
not
relevant
to
the
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
the
national
labor
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
i
think
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
in
these
cases,
it
is
arguably
or
the
arguably
determination
must
be
made
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
initially
and
should
be
made
initially.
and
that's
what
state
courts
are
doing
now.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
i
believe
there
would
be
some
instances
in
which
--
in
which
a
resort
could
be
--
head
directly
to
the
court.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
i
think
the
very
clear
instance
would
be
a
charge
of
sexual
misconduct.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
well
i
realized
that
but
i
--
but
i
don't
see
that
it
would
have
any
relevance
to
the
labor
dispute
except
of
course
it
could
in
an
area
where
you
have
--
you're
organizing
a
group
of
office
employees
and
there
is
a
charge
of
misconduct
between
certain
people
and
an
employer.
there,
it
might
be
relevant.
and
in
all
such
instances,
the
initial
determination
should
be
made
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
if
i
had
my
way,
i
would
require
that
in
all
preemption
cases,
the
initial,
the
party
should
first
be
required
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
order
to
see
or
to
obtain
some
sort
of
the
determination
as
to
whether
they
are
going
to
act
in
the
area.
but
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
no
sir.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
that
is
correct,
--
but
respect
to
garmon
in
subsequent
cases,
this
court
has
clearly
state
that
the
initial
determination
as
to
whether
an
activity
is
arguably
subject
to
section
7
or
8
is
to
be
made
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
that
is
correct,
but
somewhere
along
the
line
an
initial
determination
must
be
made
and
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
that
is
correct.
i
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
well,
if
anyone
thinks
that
the
activity
is
not
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
they
should
be
required
to
first
go
there
and
obtain
some
sort
of
a
determination
prior
to
resort
to
court.
there
should
be
a
condition
preceding
to
starting
a
court
action.
as
my
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
i
think
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
yes.
it
has
been
decided
but
my
argument
was
directed
to
those
instances
where
in
the
gray
area,
i
still
say
that
there
are
some
that
are
so
clearly
irrelevant
to
a
campaign
that
no
determination
would
be
clearly
the
board
will
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
yes,
sir.
i
would
state
so
and
qualify.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
i
think
quite
the
contrary
the
board
asserted
jurisdiction
by
making
an
investigation
and
as
a
result
of
the
investigation,
the
record
will
show,
they
check
the
membership
cards
of
the
local,
took
the
investigative
machinery
and
reached
a
conclusion,
there
wasn't
any
evidence
against
the
union.
i
would
consider
that
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
yes.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
my
position
is
that
this
was
an
effective
type
of
determination
(voice
overlap)
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
about
a
year,
yes
sir.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
yes
sir.
that
is
our
position.
the
other
areas
of
conflict,
of
course,
are
fairly
obvious.
one
area
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general
is
for
the
employer
discharge
the
employees.
suppose
mr.
doyle
was
discharged
by
mr.
linn
and
the
board
would
investigate,
issue
a
complaint
and
order
reinstatement
with
back
wages.
if
the
libel
suit
were
permitted
to
continue
the
jury
or
our
judge
might
award
mr.
linn
damages
that
would
far
exceed
the
amount
of
back
wages
or
the
lifetime
earnings
even
of
mr.
doyle.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
my
point
is
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
my
point
is
this,
mr.
justice.
the
board
is
to
effectuate
the
national
policy.
the
board
acts
in
the
public
interest
as
a
matter
of
public
policy.
so
it
orders
the
employer
to
take
back
an
employee
who
has
been
discharged
because
of
his
union
activity.
a
huge
award
against
mr.
doyle
would
mean
that
that
policy
could
not
be
effectuated
because
mr.
doyle
would
obviously
quit
his
employment
and
go
elsewhere
or
rather
than
to
have
his
legs
taken
to
satisfy
a
judgment
with
this
employer.
this
is
where
i
see
that
the
conflict,
it
prevents
the
board
from
effectuating
the
national
policy.
another
area
of
conflict
is
--
when
nlrb
holds
an
election
and
the
union
should
win
in
this
case.
and
the
employers
move
to
set
him
aside
on
the
basis
of
the
leaflet.
and
nlrb
finds
this
as
merely
permissible
activity
which
indeed
i
think
it
would.
and
then
a
jury
awards
you
to
damages
against
the
union
which
far
exceeds
the
facets.
in
this
instance,
the
policies
of
the
act,
that
employees
are
to
have
complete
freedom
of
choice
in
selecting
their
bargaining
agent
might
be
frustrated
because
the
union
might
abandon
its
efforts
to
represent
the
employees
and
go
out
of
existence
in
order
to
satisfy
in
a
judgment.
huge
or
libel
action
seeking
huge
damages
in
effectively
stipple
the
free
exchange
of
use.
i
like
the
language
used
in
the
new
york
times
case,
libel
actions
maybe
used
as
a
tool
by
which
expression
is
repressed,
if
you
think
that
applies
with
the
libel
actions.
after
garmon,
the
use
of
injunctions
and
labor
disputes
especially
in
the
area
of
peaceful
picketing,
have
been
almost
completely
eliminated.
then
all
of
a
sudden,
beginning
about
1960,
right
after
garmon
was
decided,
there
has
been
a
space
a
large
number
of
these
libel
actions
in
the
lower
courts,
most
of
them
involving
huge
sums
of
money.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
i
do
not
know,
sir.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
yes
sir,
there
are
--
there
are
two
or
three
listed
in
the
appendix
to
the
solicitor
general
that
have
gone
--
that
have
gone
to
judgment.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
as
i
recall,
they
were
quite
out
of
proportion
and
–-
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
me
personally?
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
not
that
i
can
recall
right
off
hand.
but
of
course,
in
the
detroit
michigan
area,
rather
sophisticated
area
in
terms
of
labor
relations
--
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
but
it's
like
any
other
--
that's
right.
that
is
very
true.
it's
like
any
other
lawsuit
that
started
in
the
context
of
a
labor
dispute.
if
the
union
wins
the
strike,
the
lawsuits
disappear.
if
the
union
looses,
the
lawsuit
is
pushed
in
those
instances
or
else
treated
for
something
else.
my
main
point
here
is
that
libel
actions
is
just
--
are
being
used
just
as
another
tool
of
management
and
it's'
arsenal
to
fight
unions.
and
when
injunction
actions,
were
stopped
as
a
result
of
the
garmon,
then
the
libel
actions
came
into
play.
and
the
purpose
of
it
is
to
list
public
support.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
yes
sir.
mr.
winston
l.
livingston
yes,
michigan
also
requires
that
you
publish
or
require
the
alleged
defamer
to
publish
a
retraction
before
you
may
bring
the
suit
but
it
also
allows
punitive
damages.
thank
you
very
much.
