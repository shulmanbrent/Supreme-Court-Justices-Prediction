mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
facts
were
well
stated
by
the
solicitor
general.
however,
the
dates
are
important.
the
letter
advising
ben
blue
that
criminal
prosecution
was
contemplated
--
was
mailed
on
november
1st,
1962.
the
counsel
for
ben
blue
held
the
conferences
in
los
angeles,
in
san
francisco
on
the
criminal
case.
then
in
1963
in
april,
the
jeopardy
assessments
were
made.
it
was
14
months
later
approximately
when
the
indictment
was
brought.
now,
before
i
get
into
the
matter
of
jurisdiction,
i
don't
intend
to
spend
too
much
time
on
that.
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
jeopardy
assessments.
when
the
jeopardy
assessment
is
filed,
levies
are
made
against
all
the
known
assets
of
the
taxpayer.
and
in
the
county
recorder's
office,
liens
are
filed
showing
the
same
amounts
of
taxes
due
that
are
in
the
jeopardy
assessments.
now,
as
stated
by
the
solicitor
general,
the
government
did
not
take
any
current
earnings
of
ben
blue.
but
it
had
a
right
to
do
it
over
attorneys.
not
only
that
but
the
liens
that
were
filed
attached
to
not
only
the
property
and
existence
at
the
time
of
the
assessments
but
after
acquired
property.
and
if
ben
blue
had
no
funds,
and
borrowed
some
from
--
let's
say
his
sister,
the
lien
would
attach
to
that
if
it
were
paid
over
to
an
attorney.
now,
while
among
this
matter
of
jeopardy
assessments
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
that
is
true.
the
judge
so
found
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
it's
material
in
this
respect,
as
the
solicitor
general
stated,
in
the
daeche
case
in
particular,
it
takes
a
lot
of
money
to
defend
a
case
and
we
don't
know
how
much
money
ben
blue
is
going
to
make.
this
much
is
sure
the
record
shows
that
none
of
the
money
that
was
levied
upon
had
been
released
at
that
time.
but
we
are
not
urging
at
this
point
that
ben
blue
cannot
employ
counsel.
that
is
not
being
urged
at
this
time.
we
don't
know
what
the
future
will
hold
in
that
regard
because
we
don't
know
how
long
this
case
is
going
to
take.
now,
back
to
the
jeopardy
and
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
stress
this
in
my
brief.
i
alluded
to
it
but
i
didn't
give
any
figures.
in
the
transcript,
the
first
thing
we
have
is
the
indictment.
and
count
1
shows
--
count
1
states
that
ben
blue
reported
on
his
return
taxable
income
of
$9,817.98,
that
he
shouldn't
have
reported
$12,649.56.
in
other
words,
he
had
a
deficiency
of
$2,831.
that's
--
that's
the
money
that
he
owed.
that's
according
to
the
indictment.
now,
if
you
turn
to
page
76
of
the
record,
you
find
that
the
jeopardy
assessment
was
made
in
the
amount
of
$12,023.18,
three
or
four
times
that
amount.
and
assets
were
seized
to
cover
that
amount.
in
addition
to
that,
the
jeopardy
assessment
was
in
$6,011.
now,
the
indictment
figures
are
but
a
small
fraction
of
the
jeopardy
assessment
fees.
but
note
also
that
when
the
statutory
notices
were
sent
out,
60
days
after
the
jeopardy
assessments
were
made,
the
government
admitted
in
its
report
that
the
assessment
was
in
excess
of
the
liability
by
$2,850.67
for
that
year
and
the
penalty
was
in
excess
of
$1,425.33.
now,
after
the
government
takes
his
assets,
within
two
months,
it
finds
that
it
has
taken
$5,000
too
much.
and
a
year
and
four
months
later,
in
his
indictment,
it
says
well,
we
--
at
this
point,
we
can
only
prove
$2,831
instead
of
$12,023.
i
have
to
say,
i
mentioned
in
my
brief
that
these
amounts
have
been
reduced
but
i
didn't
put
the
figures
in
there
and
i
think
i
should
have
because
when
we
take
the
six
counts,
this
is
what
we
find.
that
in
the
indictment
it
claims
that
he
understated
his
tax
and
that
of
the
corporation
by
little
less
than
$40,000.
but
if
you
take
the
figures
from
the
jeopardy
assessment,
which
are
in
the
transcript,
the
amount
there
is
about
$135,000
or
about
three
times
as
much.
and
as
the
record
also
shows,
during
this
whole
period
in
between
the
jeopardy
assessment
and
the
time
of
the
indictment,
none
of
the
liens
were
abated.
they
stayed
in
the
recorder's
office,
in
the
same
amounts
that
it
were
--
that
they
had
when
they
were
originally
filed.
now,
another
thing
there,
when
the
jeopardy
assessment
was
made,
50%
civil
penalty
was
assessed
which
was
reduced
admittedly
because
they
were
in
error.
and
there,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
jeopardy
assessment.
the
point
is
that
it
shows
how
loose
the
government
is
in
doing
these
jeopardy
assessments.
it
--
it
admits
in
--
within
60
days
that
was
quite
long.
and
by
the
time
he
gets
throughout
the
indictment
a
year
or
more
later,
that
it
was
even
worst
of
than
it
originally
thought
it
was.
now,
with
regard
to
the
operation
of
the
tax
court
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
use
of
the
jeopardy
assessment
procedures,
which
was
intended
to
be
purely
for
civil
purposes,
is
being
used
in
this
case
to
compel
the
defendant
to
incriminate
himself,
because
the
same
income,
the
same
tax
is
involved
in
the
tax
court
case
--
in
the
tax
court
petitions
in
the
tax
court
case
as
are
in
the
indictment.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
yes,
your
honor,
the
same
principle
applies.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
perhaps
indirectly
i
was
attacking
the
whole
jeopardy
assessment
procedures.
that's
when
we
come
to
this
court,
i
think
someday
and
you'll
have
a
good
look
at
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
the
combination
--
it's
the
combination
of
the
jeopardy
assessment.
its
use
in
the
hands
of
a
special
agent
whose
recommending
prosecution
to
implement
his
criminal
case.
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
but
my
point
in
showing
these
figures
is
to
show
that
the
jeopardy
assessment
itself
is
a
loose
procedure.
and
in
this
case,
were
used
apparently
to
set
up
a
criminal
case.
now,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
as
you
find
in
the
record
in
these
--
in
the
statutory
notices
that
were
sent
out
by
the
government,
they
raised
the
question
of
depreciation
on
an
automobile
that
was
disallowed
on
the
part
of
the
merry-go-round
incorporation
and
the
use
of
the
automobile
was
said
to
be
personal.
it
doesn't
involve
an
awful
lot
of
money
compared
with
the
whole
picture
but
it's
one
of
the
items
there.
alright,
now
the
tax
court
petitions
are
filed
a
year
ahead
--
a
year
or
more
ahead
of
the
--
of
the
indictment.
and
if
the
tax
court
case
comes
to
trial
first,
and
the
tax
court
does
not
necessarily
follow
the
recommendation
of
the
government,
then
i've
said
that
in
the
case
in
my
brief
where
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
tax
court
need
not
continue
a
case
if
there
is
a
related
criminal
case
pending.
but
the
tax
court
case
can
come
to
trial
and
he
--
that
the
taxpayer
has
the
burden
of
proof.
if
he
doesn't
appear,
and
i
don't
see
how
he
can
claim
a
constitutional
burden,
he
loses
the
tax.
in
other
words,
he
loses
his
case.
he
has
to
come
in.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
he
has
because
there
is
no
way
of
extending
the
period
of
time
in
which
the
government
files
a
statutory
notice
after
the
jeopardy
assessment
is
made.
it
has
to
be
done
within
60
days.
there
is
no
way
of
extending
the
90-day
period
for
the
petitioner
to
come
here
to
file
a
verified
complaint.
the
court
can't
extend
that.
nobody
can
extend
that
period.
it's
jurisdictional.
so
that
after
the
jeopardy
assessment
is
filed
within
150
days,
the
taxpayer
must
verify
a
petition
in
which
he
meets
the
allegations
of
the
government.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
he
did
that.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
general
denials
of
what
might
be
called
general
denials
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
no.
but,
let's
take
our
depreciation
matter.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
the
depreciation
of
automobiles.
so
in
the
petition,
ben
blue
states
that
the
depreciation
was
properly
taken.
now,
suppose
--
suppose
he'd
taken
a
three-year
life
on
the
automobile
and
it
turns
out
the
automobile
lasted
five
years.
in
the
tax
court
petition,
he
might
be
in
a
position
where
he'd
have
to
admit
that.
now
whereas
in
the
criminal
case
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
we
--
there's
no
way
of
knowing
how
fast
the
tax
court
is
going
to
operate
and
in
this
case,
he
has
already
--
he
has
his
verifications.
supposed
then
in
the
criminal
case,
he
comes
in
and
says
--
and
this
incidentally
is
in
a
corporate
return.
and
the
charge
there
is
under
section
7206(1)
in
filing
a
false
statement,
not
tax
evasion,
not
a
tax
evasion
count.
so
at
the
criminal
trial,
he
says,
“oh,
this
was
false
because
you
took
the
deduction
and
the
tax
court
proceeding,
you
admit
that
the
car's
lasted
--
the
car
lasted
five
years
or
lasted
three
--
five
years
when
you
took
a
three-year
life
on
that
thing.
but
it's
a
case
of
whipsawing
between
the
tax
court
and
the
district
court
on
the
criminal
trial.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
then
you
get
into
a
procedural
matter
which
i
think
was
brought
up
before.
if
a
defendant
is
in
a
position
where
he
can
defend
himself
as
he
was
in
the
case
that
mr.
solicitor
general
gave
us
here,
whether
he
have
lost
the
records.
i
believe
that's
the
heath
case.
what
is
the
point
of
going
to
trial
when
the
government
knows
that
it
can't
--
that
it
can't
succeed?
and
here
again,
going
back
to
the
boyd
case
which
we
relied
on,
it's
the
procedure
that's
unconstitutional.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
boyd
case
stands
for.
in
the
last
paragraph
it
mentions
that,
the
unconstitutional
procedure
that
was
adopted
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
aren't
we
moving
--
aren't
we
moving
into
--
aren't
we
moving
into
an
area,
your
honor,
where
it's
a
question
of
--
what
the
question
of
due
process
and
not
--
and
not
a
matter
of
evidence?
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
defendant
is
put
in
the
case
where
he's
discriminated
against,
and
--
and
can't
have
a
fair
trial,
that
he
has
the
right
to
go
beyond
the
mere
suppression
of
evidence.
and
that
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
but
he
--
he
has
--
he
has
been
compelled
to
come
in
and
make
statements
under
oath.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
i
tried
to
give
the
example
of
the
depreciation.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
in
this
particular
case,
that's
true.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
and
if
counsel
had
known
at
that
time
that
there
was
going
to
be
an
indictment,
this
might
have
been
a
little
different
petition.
what
we're
talking
now,
it
seems
to
me,
about
--
again,
you
put
a
man
on
a
rack
and
you
don't
get
the
kind
of
confession
you
want,
i
still
don't
think
that
makes
the
procedure
right.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
i
believe
procedurally,
he
would
suppress
the
evidence
and
then
wait
for
the
government
to
do
something
under
the
situation
that
you've
just
given
me
mr.
chief
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
there's
another
point
which
i
haven't
mentioned
and
that
is
the
discrimination
element
of
this.
it
is
conceded
by
the
government,
that
it
is
not
the
usual
procedure
to
make
a
jeopardy
assessment
when
criminal
prosecution
is
under
consideration.
that
is
conceded
by
the
government
in
this
brief
at
page
16.
now,
there
isn't
one
iota
of
evidence
regarding
the
reason
for
the
jeopardy
assessment,
not
one
bit.
the
chief
of
the
intelligence
division
in
los
angeles
was
on
the
stand
during
the
hearing.
no
questions
were
asked
to
him
about
the
reason
for
this.
so
we
have
a
--
we
have
a
situation
where
the
government
admits
that
it
doesn't
do
this.
the
mere
fact
that
it
doesn't
indicates
two,
the
unfairness
of
the
procedure
of
having
a
jeopardy
and
then
having
a
trial
on
the
issues
later
on,
on
the
same
issues
because
here,
there's
a
--
the
income
is
the
same,
the
tax
--
and
the
tax
is
the
same
for
both
the
jeopardy
assessment
and
for
the
indictment.
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
light
of
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
recently,
and
i
mentioned
the
griffin
case,
douglas,
coppage,
draper,
gideon,
the
rideout
case.
now,
you've
gone
beyond
the
matter
of
using
evidentiary
rules
to
give
a
man
a
fair
trial.
here,
i
repeat
what
i
said
before
that
the
jeopardy
assessment
procedure
which
is
intended
as
a
civil
matter
was
used
here
to
compel
ben
blue
to
come
in
and
make
statements.
now,
you
say,
well,
these
are
just
general
denials.
every
item
that
was
in
the
statutory
notice
had
been
answered
in
the
petition.
and
it
puts
--
it
puts
the
defendant
in
a
position
where
he
has
one
case
in
one
court
and
if
he
use
the
material
there,
and
a
case
in
another
court,
and
you
don't
know
how
that's
going
to
come
out.
and
incidentally,
in
the
criminal
case,
that's
dealt
on
a
bank
deposit,
on
a
bank
deposit
method.
and
some
years
back,
you
have
the
four
net
worth
cases,
holland
and
smith
on
--
there
you
laid
down
some
rules
in
the
use
of
evidence
and
procedures
in
net
worth
cases.
bank
deposit
is
a
similar
type
of
prosecution
where
you
use
indirect
evidence
was
all
circumstantial.
in
fact,
there
should
be
more
safeguard
around
a
bank
deposit
case
than
there
are
in
the
net
worth
case.
and
yet
here,
the
government
comes
in
and
makes
the
defendant
swear
to
some
petitions,
and
then
more
than
a
year
later,
indicts
on
the
same
income
and
the
same
tax.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
as
the
government
points
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
its
brief,
this
question
may
arise
in
other
areas.
and
i
--
i
frankly
am
in
no
position
to
take
those
and
try
to
evaluate
them
in
terms
of
what
we
have
here.
i
know
the
tax
field
and
i
know
how
this
operates.
and
we
can
see
in
this
particular
type
of
situation
where
there
is
discrimination
and
where
there
is
oppression.
now,
if
you
might
ask
too,
suppose
the
jeopardy
assessment
had
come
after
the
indictment,
where
to
the
indictment
that
would
be
a
different
situation
too.
it
just
happens
here
that
the
defendant
was
put
in
a
position
where
he
was
discriminated
against
and
where
he
had
to
come
up
with
evidence
which
the
government
might
use
in
a
criminal
case.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
facts
were
well
stated
by
the
solicitor
general.
however,
the
dates
are
important.
the
letter
advising
ben
blue
that
criminal
prosecution
was
contemplated
--
was
mailed
on
november
1st,
1962.
the
counsel
for
ben
blue
held
the
conferences
in
los
angeles,
in
san
francisco
on
the
criminal
case.
then
in
1963
in
april,
the
jeopardy
assessments
were
made.
it
was
14
months
later
approximately
when
the
indictment
was
brought.
now,
before
i
get
into
the
matter
of
jurisdiction,
i
don't
intend
to
spend
too
much
time
on
that.
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
jeopardy
assessments.
when
the
jeopardy
assessment
is
filed,
levies
are
made
against
all
the
known
assets
of
the
taxpayer.
and
in
the
county
recorder's
office,
liens
are
filed
showing
the
same
amounts
of
taxes
due
that
are
in
the
jeopardy
assessments.
now,
as
stated
by
the
solicitor
general,
the
government
did
not
take
any
current
earnings
of
ben
blue.
but
it
had
a
right
to
do
it
over
attorneys.
not
only
that
but
the
liens
that
were
filed
attached
to
not
only
the
property
and
existence
at
the
time
of
the
assessments
but
after
acquired
property.
and
if
ben
blue
had
no
funds,
and
borrowed
some
from
--
let's
say
his
sister,
the
lien
would
attach
to
that
if
it
were
paid
over
to
an
attorney.
now,
while
among
this
matter
of
jeopardy
assessments
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
that
is
true.
the
judge
so
found
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
it's
material
in
this
respect,
as
the
solicitor
general
stated,
in
the
daeche
case
in
particular,
it
takes
a
lot
of
money
to
defend
a
case
and
we
don't
know
how
much
money
ben
blue
is
going
to
make.
this
much
is
sure
the
record
shows
that
none
of
the
money
that
was
levied
upon
had
been
released
at
that
time.
but
we
are
not
urging
at
this
point
that
ben
blue
cannot
employ
counsel.
that
is
not
being
urged
at
this
time.
we
don't
know
what
the
future
will
hold
in
that
regard
because
we
don't
know
how
long
this
case
is
going
to
take.
now,
back
to
the
jeopardy
and
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
stress
this
in
my
brief.
i
alluded
to
it
but
i
didn't
give
any
figures.
in
the
transcript,
the
first
thing
we
have
is
the
indictment.
and
count
1
shows
--
count
1
states
that
ben
blue
reported
on
his
return
taxable
income
of
$9,817.98,
that
he
shouldn't
have
reported
$12,649.56.
in
other
words,
he
had
a
deficiency
of
$2,831.
that's
--
that's
the
money
that
he
owed.
that's
according
to
the
indictment.
now,
if
you
turn
to
page
76
of
the
record,
you
find
that
the
jeopardy
assessment
was
made
in
the
amount
of
$12,023.18,
three
or
four
times
that
amount.
and
assets
were
seized
to
cover
that
amount.
in
addition
to
that,
the
jeopardy
assessment
was
in
$6,011.
now,
the
indictment
figures
are
but
a
small
fraction
of
the
jeopardy
assessment
fees.
but
note
also
that
when
the
statutory
notices
were
sent
out,
60
days
after
the
jeopardy
assessments
were
made,
the
government
admitted
in
its
report
that
the
assessment
was
in
excess
of
the
liability
by
$2,850.67
for
that
year
and
the
penalty
was
in
excess
of
$1,425.33.
now,
after
the
government
takes
his
assets,
within
two
months,
it
finds
that
it
has
taken
$5,000
too
much.
and
a
year
and
four
months
later,
in
his
indictment,
it
says
well,
we
--
at
this
point,
we
can
only
prove
$2,831
instead
of
$12,023.
i
have
to
say,
i
mentioned
in
my
brief
that
these
amounts
have
been
reduced
but
i
didn't
put
the
figures
in
there
and
i
think
i
should
have
because
when
we
take
the
six
counts,
this
is
what
we
find.
that
in
the
indictment
it
claims
that
he
understated
his
tax
and
that
of
the
corporation
by
little
less
than
$40,000.
but
if
you
take
the
figures
from
the
jeopardy
assessment,
which
are
in
the
transcript,
the
amount
there
is
about
$135,000
or
about
three
times
as
much.
and
as
the
record
also
shows,
during
this
whole
period
in
between
the
jeopardy
assessment
and
the
time
of
the
indictment,
none
of
the
liens
were
abated.
they
stayed
in
the
recorder's
office,
in
the
same
amounts
that
it
were
--
that
they
had
when
they
were
originally
filed.
now,
another
thing
there,
when
the
jeopardy
assessment
was
made,
50%
civil
penalty
was
assessed
which
was
reduced
admittedly
because
they
were
in
error.
and
there,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
jeopardy
assessment.
the
point
is
that
it
shows
how
loose
the
government
is
in
doing
these
jeopardy
assessments.
it
--
it
admits
in
--
within
60
days
that
was
quite
long.
and
by
the
time
he
gets
throughout
the
indictment
a
year
or
more
later,
that
it
was
even
worst
of
than
it
originally
thought
it
was.
now,
with
regard
to
the
operation
of
the
tax
court
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
use
of
the
jeopardy
assessment
procedures,
which
was
intended
to
be
purely
for
civil
purposes,
is
being
used
in
this
case
to
compel
the
defendant
to
incriminate
himself,
because
the
same
income,
the
same
tax
is
involved
in
the
tax
court
case
--
in
the
tax
court
petitions
in
the
tax
court
case
as
are
in
the
indictment.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
yes,
your
honor,
the
same
principle
applies.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
perhaps
indirectly
i
was
attacking
the
whole
jeopardy
assessment
procedures.
that's
when
we
come
to
this
court,
i
think
someday
and
you'll
have
a
good
look
at
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
the
combination
--
it's
the
combination
of
the
jeopardy
assessment.
its
use
in
the
hands
of
a
special
agent
whose
recommending
prosecution
to
implement
his
criminal
case.
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
but
my
point
in
showing
these
figures
is
to
show
that
the
jeopardy
assessment
itself
is
a
loose
procedure.
and
in
this
case,
were
used
apparently
to
set
up
a
criminal
case.
now,
let
me
give
you
an
example.
as
you
find
in
the
record
in
these
--
in
the
statutory
notices
that
were
sent
out
by
the
government,
they
raised
the
question
of
depreciation
on
an
automobile
that
was
disallowed
on
the
part
of
the
merry-go-round
incorporation
and
the
use
of
the
automobile
was
said
to
be
personal.
it
doesn't
involve
an
awful
lot
of
money
compared
with
the
whole
picture
but
it's
one
of
the
items
there.
alright,
now
the
tax
court
petitions
are
filed
a
year
ahead
--
a
year
or
more
ahead
of
the
--
of
the
indictment.
and
if
the
tax
court
case
comes
to
trial
first,
and
the
tax
court
does
not
necessarily
follow
the
recommendation
of
the
government,
then
i've
said
that
in
the
case
in
my
brief
where
the
circuit
court
held
that
the
tax
court
need
not
continue
a
case
if
there
is
a
related
criminal
case
pending.
but
the
tax
court
case
can
come
to
trial
and
he
--
that
the
taxpayer
has
the
burden
of
proof.
if
he
doesn't
appear,
and
i
don't
see
how
he
can
claim
a
constitutional
burden,
he
loses
the
tax.
in
other
words,
he
loses
his
case.
he
has
to
come
in.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
he
has
because
there
is
no
way
of
extending
the
period
of
time
in
which
the
government
files
a
statutory
notice
after
the
jeopardy
assessment
is
made.
it
has
to
be
done
within
60
days.
there
is
no
way
of
extending
the
90-day
period
for
the
petitioner
to
come
here
to
file
a
verified
complaint.
the
court
can't
extend
that.
nobody
can
extend
that
period.
it's
jurisdictional.
so
that
after
the
jeopardy
assessment
is
filed
within
150
days,
the
taxpayer
must
verify
a
petition
in
which
he
meets
the
allegations
of
the
government.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
he
did
that.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
general
denials
of
what
might
be
called
general
denials
(voice
overlap).
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
no.
but,
let's
take
our
depreciation
matter.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
the
depreciation
of
automobiles.
so
in
the
petition,
ben
blue
states
that
the
depreciation
was
properly
taken.
now,
suppose
--
suppose
he'd
taken
a
three-year
life
on
the
automobile
and
it
turns
out
the
automobile
lasted
five
years.
in
the
tax
court
petition,
he
might
be
in
a
position
where
he'd
have
to
admit
that.
now
whereas
in
the
criminal
case
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
we
--
there's
no
way
of
knowing
how
fast
the
tax
court
is
going
to
operate
and
in
this
case,
he
has
already
--
he
has
his
verifications.
supposed
then
in
the
criminal
case,
he
comes
in
and
says
--
and
this
incidentally
is
in
a
corporate
return.
and
the
charge
there
is
under
section
7206(1)
in
filing
a
false
statement,
not
tax
evasion,
not
a
tax
evasion
count.
so
at
the
criminal
trial,
he
says,
“oh,
this
was
false
because
you
took
the
deduction
and
the
tax
court
proceeding,
you
admit
that
the
car's
lasted
--
the
car
lasted
five
years
or
lasted
three
--
five
years
when
you
took
a
three-year
life
on
that
thing.
but
it's
a
case
of
whipsawing
between
the
tax
court
and
the
district
court
on
the
criminal
trial.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
then
you
get
into
a
procedural
matter
which
i
think
was
brought
up
before.
if
a
defendant
is
in
a
position
where
he
can
defend
himself
as
he
was
in
the
case
that
mr.
solicitor
general
gave
us
here,
whether
he
have
lost
the
records.
i
believe
that's
the
heath
case.
what
is
the
point
of
going
to
trial
when
the
government
knows
that
it
can't
--
that
it
can't
succeed?
and
here
again,
going
back
to
the
boyd
case
which
we
relied
on,
it's
the
procedure
that's
unconstitutional.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
boyd
case
stands
for.
in
the
last
paragraph
it
mentions
that,
the
unconstitutional
procedure
that
was
adopted
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
aren't
we
moving
--
aren't
we
moving
into
--
aren't
we
moving
into
an
area,
your
honor,
where
it's
a
question
of
--
what
the
question
of
due
process
and
not
--
and
not
a
matter
of
evidence?
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
defendant
is
put
in
the
case
where
he's
discriminated
against,
and
--
and
can't
have
a
fair
trial,
that
he
has
the
right
to
go
beyond
the
mere
suppression
of
evidence.
and
that
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
but
he
--
he
has
--
he
has
been
compelled
to
come
in
and
make
statements
under
oath.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
i
tried
to
give
the
example
of
the
depreciation.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
in
this
particular
case,
that's
true.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
and
if
counsel
had
known
at
that
time
that
there
was
going
to
be
an
indictment,
this
might
have
been
a
little
different
petition.
what
we're
talking
now,
it
seems
to
me,
about
--
again,
you
put
a
man
on
a
rack
and
you
don't
get
the
kind
of
confession
you
want,
i
still
don't
think
that
makes
the
procedure
right.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
i
believe
procedurally,
he
would
suppress
the
evidence
and
then
wait
for
the
government
to
do
something
under
the
situation
that
you've
just
given
me
mr.
chief
--
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
there's
another
point
which
i
haven't
mentioned
and
that
is
the
discrimination
element
of
this.
it
is
conceded
by
the
government,
that
it
is
not
the
usual
procedure
to
make
a
jeopardy
assessment
when
criminal
prosecution
is
under
consideration.
that
is
conceded
by
the
government
in
this
brief
at
page
16.
now,
there
isn't
one
iota
of
evidence
regarding
the
reason
for
the
jeopardy
assessment,
not
one
bit.
the
chief
of
the
intelligence
division
in
los
angeles
was
on
the
stand
during
the
hearing.
no
questions
were
asked
to
him
about
the
reason
for
this.
so
we
have
a
--
we
have
a
situation
where
the
government
admits
that
it
doesn't
do
this.
the
mere
fact
that
it
doesn't
indicates
two,
the
unfairness
of
the
procedure
of
having
a
jeopardy
and
then
having
a
trial
on
the
issues
later
on,
on
the
same
issues
because
here,
there's
a
--
the
income
is
the
same,
the
tax
--
and
the
tax
is
the
same
for
both
the
jeopardy
assessment
and
for
the
indictment.
the
--
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
light
of
the
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
recently,
and
i
mentioned
the
griffin
case,
douglas,
coppage,
draper,
gideon,
the
rideout
case.
now,
you've
gone
beyond
the
matter
of
using
evidentiary
rules
to
give
a
man
a
fair
trial.
here,
i
repeat
what
i
said
before
that
the
jeopardy
assessment
procedure
which
is
intended
as
a
civil
matter
was
used
here
to
compel
ben
blue
to
come
in
and
make
statements.
now,
you
say,
well,
these
are
just
general
denials.
every
item
that
was
in
the
statutory
notice
had
been
answered
in
the
petition.
and
it
puts
--
it
puts
the
defendant
in
a
position
where
he
has
one
case
in
one
court
and
if
he
use
the
material
there,
and
a
case
in
another
court,
and
you
don't
know
how
that's
going
to
come
out.
and
incidentally,
in
the
criminal
case,
that's
dealt
on
a
bank
deposit,
on
a
bank
deposit
method.
and
some
years
back,
you
have
the
four
net
worth
cases,
holland
and
smith
on
--
there
you
laid
down
some
rules
in
the
use
of
evidence
and
procedures
in
net
worth
cases.
bank
deposit
is
a
similar
type
of
prosecution
where
you
use
indirect
evidence
was
all
circumstantial.
in
fact,
there
should
be
more
safeguard
around
a
bank
deposit
case
than
there
are
in
the
net
worth
case.
and
yet
here,
the
government
comes
in
and
makes
the
defendant
swear
to
some
petitions,
and
then
more
than
a
year
later,
indicts
on
the
same
income
and
the
same
tax.
mr.
ernest
r.
mortenson
well,
as
the
government
points
out,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
its
brief,
this
question
may
arise
in
other
areas.
and
i
--
i
frankly
am
in
no
position
to
take
those
and
try
to
evaluate
them
in
terms
of
what
we
have
here.
i
know
the
tax
field
and
i
know
how
this
operates.
and
we
can
see
in
this
particular
type
of
situation
where
there
is
discrimination
and
where
there
is
oppression.
now,
if
you
might
ask
too,
suppose
the
jeopardy
assessment
had
come
after
the
indictment,
where
to
the
indictment
that
would
be
a
different
situation
too.
it
just
happens
here
that
the
defendant
was
put
in
a
position
where
he
was
discriminated
against
and
where
he
had
to
come
up
with
evidence
which
the
government
might
use
in
a
criminal
case.
thank
you,
your
honors.
