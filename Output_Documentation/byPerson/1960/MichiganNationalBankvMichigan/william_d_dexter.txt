mr.
william
d.
dexter
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
the
essential
question
here
involves
the
validity
of
a
michigan
statute
imposed
upon
the
shares
of
the
appellant
bank.
it's
a
5
1/2-mill
tax.
it
is
measured
by
the
capital
account
of
the
appellant
bank
that
represents
4%
of
the
appellant
bank's
employable
assets.
the
trial
court
in
response
to
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
the
appellant
has
presented
here
both
by
brief
and
by
oral
argument,
decided
that
the
restrictions
imposed
on
the
state
of
michigan
to
tax
national
bank
shares
had
not
been
violated.
the
supreme
court
of
michigan,
by
a
unanimous
decision
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion.
now,
frankly,
everything
that
the
appellant
has
brought
before
this
court
in
argument
has
been
answered
thrice
by
the
appellees
both
in
the
trial
court,
in
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
and
i
believe
quite
comprehensively
and
adequately
by
the
appellees'
brief
filed
in
this
court.
i
do
believe,
however,
that
it
would
be
helpful
to
this
court
to
see
the
issue
in
this
case
put
in
a
proper
setting.
i
would
then
begin
by
informing
the
court
generally,
of
the
tax
picture
in
michigan
concerning
the
taxation
of
financial
businesses.
now,
prior
to
1952,
the
state
of
michigan
did
not
impose
any
tax
on
national
bank
stock.
it
did
impose
a
4-mill
franchise
privilege
fee
on
banks
and
trust
companies
under
the
general
corporation
law.
this
tax
is
measured
by
paid-up
capital
and
surplus
of
each
of
these
institutions.
this
tax,
the
4-mill
tax
on
paid-up
capital
and
surplus,
the
annual
franchise
privilege
fee
in
michigan
imposed
on
all
corporations,
was
also
paid
generally
by
financial
corporations
in
the
state
of
michigan.
also
in
1952
and
prior
thereto,
the
general
financial
businesses
in
terms
of
their
intangible
properties
were
subject
to
a
tax
of
3.5%
on
the
dividends
paid
or
received
by
such
corporations
on
their
stock
holdings.
also,
there
was
a
tax
of
1/25
of
1%
on
various
intangible
properties
classified
as
accounts
receivable.
in
addition,
under
the
general
intangibles
tax
act,
there
was
imposed
the
tax
of
40
cents
per
1000
that
the
appellant
refers
to,
on
cash
deposits
in
all
banking
and
financial
institutions
and
savings
and
loan
share
account
moneys.
in
addition,
in
1952
and
prior
thereto,
the
state
of
michigan
imposed
on
domestic
savings
and
loan
associations,
a
franchise
fee
measured
by
1/4
mill
of
the
pay
--
of
the
savings
share
account
and
legal
reserve
moneys
of
each
state
institution.
now,
by
a
series
of
amendments
in
1954,
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
were
subjected
to
the
same
tax.
in
addition,
the
financial
businesses
generally,
were
subject
to
some
miscellaneous
taxes
to
which
appellant
bank
was
not
subject.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
your
honor,
up
until
--
in
1952,
the
state
of
michigan
had
not
imposed
this
1/4
mill
franchise
tax,
but
in
1954,
they
did,
yes.
currently
now,
they're
on
a
parity.
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
i
didn’t
fit
--
yes.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes.
i
--
i
think
that
i
have
if
i've
answered
your
honor's
question.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
your
honor.
these
--
these
are
the
--
these
are
the
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--
the
statute
under
consideration
here,
except
in
1952,
the
state
of
michigan
removed
state
banks
and
trust
companies
from
the
4-mill
tax
on
the
corporate
privilege
fee
and
removed
the
dividends
and
income
from
their
stock
from
the
3
1/2-mill
intangibles
to
or
that
the
tax
measured
by
3.5%
of
income
from
--
income-producing
intangibles,
which
would
include
the
stock
of
the
appellant
bank
and
in
lieu
of
these
two
taxes
by
act
9
of
the
public
acts
of
1953,
imposed
the
5
1/2-mill
tax
we
have
before
the
court,
now.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
this
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
your
honor.
i
meant
to
say
that
--
i
was
giving
the
court
the
picture
of
the
general
treatment
in
michigan
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--
of
financial
institutions
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--
in
1952.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
this
is
right.
this
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
decisions
interpreting
section
5219,
that
the
practical
operative
effect
of
the
total
tax
burden
on
alleged
competing
financial
institutions
is
the
test
to
be
employed.
and
i
am
showing
not
only
the
total
financial
burden
tax
wise
by
the
state
of
michigan,
on
the
alleged
competing
institutions
here,
but
also
on
the
general
financial
businesses,
because
i
think
this
is
significant
in
relationship
to
this
court's
repeated
pronouncement
that
only
tax
discriminations
intended
to
create
or
foster
a
hostile
or
unfriendly
attitude
for
the
business
of
national
banks
is
prohibited.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
your
honor.
it's
certainly
is
not
a
subjective
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--
test.
it's
an
objective
test
and
this
is
the
kind
of
test
that
we
have
employed
in
developing
our
case
here,
that
is
looking
to
the
actual
realities
of
the
taxation
of
the
two
alleged
competing
institutions
and
see
exactly
how
in
terms
of
competition
and
in
terms
of
real
discrimination
in
terms
of
this
competition.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right
or
yes
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
the
savings
and
loan
associations.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
let
me
start
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes.
alright
the
only
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes.
the
only
tax
imposed
on
national
banks
in
1952
by
the
state
of
michigan
was
the
5
1/2-mill
tax
imposed
by
an
amendment
of
the
general
intangibles
tax
law
by
act
9
of
the
michigan
public
acts
of
1953.
this
tax
plus
the
tax
on
the
real
property
of
the
bank
constituted
the
sole
tax
burden
to
the
state
of
michigan,
which
incidentally
represented
about
8/10
--
9/10th
of
a
mill
on
the
total
employable
assets
of
the
appellant
bank,
but
this
was
their
total
tax
burden.
now,
as
distinguished
from
that
burden,
the
savings
and
loan
associations
pay
a
tax
of
40
cents
per
1000
on
the
share
accounts.
and
also,
depositors
in
banks
paid
a
tax
of
40
cents
per
1000,
but
this
tax
was
absorbed
by
the
banks
and
generally
is
in
michigan.
but
in
addition
to
the
40
cents
per
$1000
tax
on
michigan
savings
and
loan
shares
including
the
federal,
the
state
savings
and
loans
only
in
1952
and
both
state
and
federal
in
1954,
paid
a
1/4
of
a
mill
franchise
tax
to
the
secretary
of
state's
office,
measured
by
the
total
share
account
and
the
legal
reserves
of
each
institution.
also,
the
savings
and
loan
associations
in
michigan
were
subject
to
a
lot
of
miscellaneous
taxes
that
the
national
banks
could
not
be
subjected
to
because
of
the
restrictions
imposed
on
a
state's
power
by
section
5219.
this
includes
a
personal
property
tax.
it
would
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
this
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes,
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
do
that
and
i
think
that
this
can
be
accomplished
by
an
examination
of
the
competitive
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case.
now,
appellant
bank's
capital
account,
that
is
the
subject
of
this
5
1/2-mill
tax
we're
here
concerned
with,
represented
4%
of
its
employable
assets.
in
other
words,
it
was
$13,000,000
out
of
$306,000,000.
the
balance
of
the
appellant's
employable
assets
made
--
was
made
up
of
deposit
money
of
$283,000,000
and
these
moneys,
$283,000,000,
$157,000,000
were
demand
deposits,
the
balance
were
time
deposits
of
one
kind
or
another.
now,
also
in
1952,
this
equity
capital,
this
capital
that
the
appellant
is
talking
about
in
reference
to
section
5219
was
able
to
command
in
the
loan
activity,
a
loan,
approximately
12
times
the
assets
of
a
dollar
value
of
a
savings
and
loan
share
account.
it
was
able
to
command
in
the
financial
field,
$23
to
$1
of
the
capital
account.
it
was
able
to
produce
in
1952
a
net
profit
of
31.5%
before
federal
income
taxes
on
the
total
capital
account
of
the
appellant
bank
which
translated
into
the
original
investment
in
the
appellant
bank
by
stock
holders
in
1941,
amounted
to
several
hundred
percent
return
on
the
original
capital
investment.
this
can
be
translated
also
into
an
analogy
with
the
facts,
all
the
savings
and
loan
people.
the
savings
and
loan
people
allegedly
in
competition
with
the
business
of
national
--
the
appellant
national
bank
in
michigan
in
1952,
had
total
share
account
moneys
of
$143,000,000,
mutual
moneys
pooled
by
savers,
which
was
less
than
the
appellant's
demand
deposits
on
which
it
paid
no
interest.
these
share
account
moneys
were
able
to
use
or
able
to
produce
only
3.3%
return.
now,
we
simply
are
essentially
saying
that
the
appellant
bank
with
the
broad
powers
given
a
national
bank
in
association,
with
the
ability
to
create
checkbook
money,
with
the
exclusive
ability
to
receive
deposit
moneys,
is
in
a
position
economically
to
really
employ
equity
capital
and
that
a
--
in
a
dollar
investment
in
a
share
of
national
bank
stock,
is
an
entirely
different
thing
than
a
so
called
investment
in
a
savings
and
loan
share
account
dollar.
for
this
reason,
the
only
expert
testimony
produced
in
this
cause,
professor
woodward,
of
the
university
of
michigan,
a
professor
of
finance
and
taxation
said
that,
"if
you
wanted
to
make
a
competitive
that
economic
comparison
of
these
two
institutions
in
a
realistic
manner,
you
had
to
look
to
what
each
institution
had
to
compete
with,
namely
so
many
dollars."
essentially,
we
say
then
that
the
appellant
bank
equipped
with
these
broad
powers,
could
employ
a
--
on
a
ratio
of
23
to
1
assets,
in
the
residential
mortgage
market
or
any
other
activity
it
sought
to
engage
in.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
i
--
i
think
that
that
question
really
interrelated
and
let
me
say
why.
tax
discrimination
or
rate
discrimination
as
the
appellant
would
phrase
it,
under
section
5219,
is
only
the
kind
of
discrimination
by
a
state
that
can
be
said
to
discourage
an
investment
in
a
national
bank
stock
and
to
that
end
places
the
business
of
national
banks
at
a
competitive
disadvantage.
and
we
simply
say
as
long
as
savings
and
loan
share
accounts,
impossibly
employed
in
competition
in
the
residential
mortgage
market
admittedly
with
the
deposit
money
of
the
appellant
bank
are
treated
equally,
there
really
isn't
any
discrimination
in
fact
and
none
can
be
read
into
section
5219.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
what?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
the
competitive
units,
your
honor,
are
treated
equal.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes.
the
bank
actually,
in
1952,
employed
its
deposit
money
and
primarily
its
time
deposit
money
under
the
comptroller's
regulations,
in
a
residential
mortgage
market.
and
there
primarily
in
a
field
guaranteed
by
the
federal
government
so
these
assets
could
be
considered
liquid
by
the
bank.
on
the
other
hand,
the
savings
and
loan
share
account
money
was
employed
in
the
same
way.
now,
these
have
been
taxed
equally
by
the
state
of
michigan.
then
if
you
step
back
and
take
the
total
asset
--
the
total
asset
comparison
that
we
have
used
in
our
brief,
you'll
come
up
with
equal
taxation.
if
you
took
a
gross
income
to
gross
income
comparison,
you
come
up
with
equivalent
taxation.
if
you
take
the
capitalization
of
earnings
at
the
same
rate
of
return,
you
come
up
with
equal
taxation.
and
we
say,
under
these
kinds
of
circumstances,
there
really
isn't
anything
for
the
appellant
to
complain
about
within
the
purview
of
section
5219.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
i
--
i
know
what
it
is
and
i
think
i
can
explain
it.
the
appellant
says,
"our
capital
is
this
$13,000,000
in
terms
of
talking
about
rate
discrimination
and
he
compares
to
5
1/2
mills
on
the
$13,000,000
or
the
capital
account
or
equity
capital
of
the
appellant
bank
and
forgets,
for
purposes
of
the
talking
about
discrimination,
all
of
the
deposit
money
that
it
called,
borrowed
capital.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
we
say
that
--
your
honor
that
if
you
take
--
really,
we
have
a
two-pronged
practical
argument
at
this
level.
and
is
simply
this,
that
if
the
capital
of
the
appellant
as
defined
in
section
5219,
is
limited
to
equity
capital,
we
could
say,
"yes,
there
is
a
discrimination
rate
wise
here."
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
it
would
not
be
that
because
he
had
--
they
have
not
taken
in
the
total
tax
picture.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
they
--
they
got
the
8
from
the
--
in
reference
to
the
state
associations
that
paid
that
1/4
of
a
mill
and
he
got
the
13
from
leaving
this
1/4
of
a
mill
out.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
so
we
aren't
--
we
don't
--
it
maybe
6
if
you
actually
worked
it
out
but
again,
this
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
exhibit
213
shows
that
--
that
the
tax
is
on
these
institutions
and
compared
them
across
the
board.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
not.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
i
--
yes,
i
haven't
finished
this
yet,
you
see.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
so
that
here
--
at
this
level,
you
could
say,
"why,
yes,
there
are
--
there
is
tax
discrimination."
and
of
course,
at
--
at
this
level
also,
you
have
to
say
that
a
savings
share
account
is
like
an
equity
investment
in
a
share
of
national
bank
stock
and
i
think
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
difference
between
a
share
of
stock
and
a
deposit
in
a
savings
and
loan
share
account
that
the
latter
is
analogous
to
a
bank
deposit.
but
then,
the
appellant
without
tying
in
its
discrimination
argument,
jumps
over
and
talks
about
substantial
competition.
but
when
it
talks
about
competition
under
5219,
it's
talking
about
the
employment
of
the
deposit
moneys
of
the
bank,
you
see
and
we
simply
say
under
this
kind
of
situation,
we
don't
care
whether
you
talk
about
the
deposits
being
part
of
the
capital
of
the
bank
or
not.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
what?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
which
do
i
say?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
i
think,
your
honor
on
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
clement
national
bank
case,
i
think
they
ruled
out
deposits
from
being
the
capital
of
the
bank,
but
i
think
also,
they
ruled
out
in
that
case,
specifically
any
protection
over
the
taxation
or
employment
of
this
kind
of
money.
so
that
we
say
that
--
that
the
capital
of
the
bank
has
not
been
established
by
this
in
this
case
factually,
to
have
been
in
any
competition
with
the
savings
and
loan
businesses,
but
rather
that
they
have
used
a
portion
of
their
time
deposits.
but
we've
backed
off
from
this
and
said,
"even
though
this
is
true,
let's
look
at
the
total
picture
of
the
two
institutions."
the
practical
operative
effect
of
the
michigan's
tax
structure
on
them
and
see
what
result
we
reach.
now,
the
economic
--
the
money
and
banking
professor
that
i
referred
to,
refers
to
the
appellant's
comparison
on
economic
sense
as
completely
absurd
and
come
to
the
view
point
of
make
an
asset
to
asset
comparison
because
he
found
no
real
foundation
in
economic
fact
to
make
the
great
comparison
between
a
deposit
in
a
savings
and
loans
share
account,
although
technically,
it's
a
share
of
stock
and
in
an
equity
investment
in
a
share
of
national
bank
stock.
the
--
but
essentially,
this
is
our
legal
argument
in
regard
to
substantial
competition
and
in
regard
to
discrimination.
i
think
they
have
to
be
considered
together
and
they're
considered
in
reference
to
the
announced
purpose
of
section
5219
which
is
to
protect
national
bank
investors
and
the
business
of
national
banks
from
unequal
and
unfriendly
competition.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
and
of
course
the
--
the
--
this
language
of
congress
has
been
subject
to
judicial
determine
--
judicial
interpretation
by
this
court.
and
the
first
thing
they
had
to
decide
was
there
any
exception
to
this
language?
is
it
a
literal
application?
and
the
court
struggled
for
years
in
trying
to
determine
what
was
meant
by
the
phrase,
other
moneyed
capital.
but
the
court
said
that
it
was
--
that
this
statute
was
not
designed
to
rewrite
the
tax
structures
of
the
state,
but
as
said
in
the
tradesmen’s
case
by
this
court
as
late
as
1940,
it
was
designed
to
subject
to
tax
in
a
practical
way,
economic
equivalence
and
this
is
the
conclusion
that
professor
powell
reached
in
regard
to
the
section
5219
cases
in
his
law
review
article,
much
ado
about
gross
receipts
taxes.
that
simply
--
yes,
section
5219
has
been
interpreted
and
if
you
took
the
fact
that
rate
was
the
only
thing
that
you
looked
at
and
then
you
looked
at
the
species
of
what
we
might
call
other
moneyed
capital,
you
come
out
with
a
mechanical
kind
of
interpretation
and
discrimination.
the
difficulty
with
that
argument
in
the
instant
case
is
that
it
would
also
bring
within
the
purview
of
other
moneyed
capital,
bank
deposits
which
would
end
up
with
the
absurd
result
of
requiring
a
michigan
state
bank
to
pay
a
tax
of
11.5%
or
125
mills
on
its
capital
account
compared
to
a
5
1/2
mill
tax
on
the
appellant.
in
other
words,
if
other
moneyed
capital
or
moneyed
capital
within
5219
is
so
constructed
to
bring
within
its
purview
savings
and
loan
share
accounts,
it
has
to
bring
within
its
purview
united
states
government
bonds,
it
has
to
bring
within
its
purview
credit
unions
and
a
lot
of
other
favored
or
differently
treated
species
of
property.
now,
we
simply
say
that
this
court
in
its
wisdom
recognized
that
a
mechanical
interpretation
in
the
approach
of
section
5219
was
not
adequate.
that
you
had
to
determine
what
congress
intended
by
this
provision,
what
it
was
trying
to
protect
and
then
interpret
and
apply
this
language
in
relationship
to
that
intent.
and
we
say
that
in
following
--
had
--
have
i
answered
your
question?
in
--
in
following
out
this
congressional
purpose,
the
--
this
court
long
recognized
that
the
states
could
exempt
or
they
could
preferentially
treat
some
moneyed
capital
in
the
state,
without
violating
any
shared
tax
on
national
banks
by
section
5219,
so
long
as
certain
essential
tests
always
laid
down
by
this
court
to
protect
an
investor
in
national
bank
stock
was
meant.
one
of
them
was
that
it
was
a
partial
exemption
only.
in
other
words,
it
was
permitting
the
states
for
public
policy
purposes,
to
carve
out
some
species
of
property
that
may
be
characterized
as
moneyed
capital.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
what?
this
is
one
of
the
arguments
that
we
have,
your
honor.
it
is
what
we
call
the
partial
exemption
rule,
developed
by
a
long
number
of
decisions
of
this
court,
applied
by
this
court
to
mutual
savings
banks,
applied
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
hoeing
case
to
savings
and
loan
associations.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
this
is
right.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
this
is
--
this
argument
is
on
the
basis
that
there
--
there
is
a
discrimination.
we
do
not
concede
this
in
any
sense.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
the
argument
would
apply,
only
your
honor,
if
you
concluded
that
the
mechanical
rate
comparison
required
--
argued
by
the
appellant
and
--
and
questioned
by
justice
whittaker,
would
have
to
prevail.
then
you
move
on
to
the
question
of
whether
--
even
if
there
is
discrimination,
still,
can
the
states
exempt
some
moneyed
capital?
a
relatively
immaterial
part
maybe
the
total
moneyed
capital
employed
for
just
reason,
when
it's
not
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right.
this
is
another
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
they're
bow
to
our
--
another
arrow
to
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--
our
bow.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right.
i
might
--
i
might
add
there
that
both
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
held
that
the
partial
exemption
rule
still
obtain.
that
is
that
in
the
instant
case,
the
state
of
michigan
exempted
federal
--
federal
and
state
savings
and
loan
associations
for
a
just
reason
that
there
wasn't
any
evidence
of
any
unfriendly
discrimination
resulting
from
this
kind
of
treatment,
because
the
two
difference
--
the
differences
in
the
species
of
property
involved
and
the
comparable
taxation
or
economic
equivalent.
so
they
said,
"on
this
basis,
we
say
the
appellant
has
not
shown
the
tax
invalid
under
section
5219."
and
the
supreme
court
also
went
ahead
and
decided
the
mixed
question
of
fact
in
law
that
is
substantial
competition
and
there
found
because
of
the
difference
is
in
the
institutions,
the
limited
area
of
real
competition
that
the
--
the
competition
was
too
narrow
and
too
insubstantial
to
be
considered
substantial
competition
under
section
5219,
so
this
is
another
bow
to
our
arrow,
so
to
speak.
there
is
no
arrow
to
our
bow,
i
should
say.
there
is
no
substantial
competition
established.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
there
--
no,
your
honor,
there
are
differences.
now,
it's
up
to
this
court
to
say
whether
they
are
material
or
not.
we
certainly
are
not
resting
our
case
essentially
on
the
fact
that
they
are
entering
the
residential
mortgage
market
differently.
we
do
say
that
the
main
area
of
competition
is
the
federally
sponsored
competition
in
the
f.h.a.
and
v.a.
field
and
wonder
whether
this
kind
of
involvement
of
both
institutions
would
result
in
a
substantial
competition
prohibited
by
congress
in
another
piece
of
legislation.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
that
is
one
of
the
keys,
definitely.
another
key
that
we
have
to
our
argument
is
simply
what
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
and
this
is
true
and
so
that
we
have
to
drop
down
and
try
to
treat
[attempt
to
laughter]
them
on
the
basis
of
what
they're
able
to
accomplish
because
of
the
different
equipment
that
they
have.
and
this
is
what
the
asset
for
asset
or
the
income
to
income
comparison
really
tries
to
do.
it
tries
to
get
down
and
measure
the
result
of
this
different
equipment
that
each
institutions
have.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
this
is
true
and
has
taken
it
into
account
in
various
way
--
it
has
taken
it
into
account
in
saying
that
only
the
discriminations
resulting
on
unequal
and
unfriendly
competition
is
prohibited
by
section
5219.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
but
it
is
not
a
quantitative,
your
honor.
it
is
a
qualitative.
this
i
want
to
insist
upon.
it's
the
ability
of
the
bank
to
carry
on
broad
monetary
powers.
it's
the
exclusive
ability
of
the
bank
to
receive
deposits.
actually,
the
savings
and
loan
share
account
is
analogous
from
an
economic
sense
to
a
bank
deposit.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
that
ultimately,
they're
not
comparable.
like
the
appellant
said,
"one
thing
that
we
say
is
that
how
can
non-comparable
institutions
be
considered
to
be
in
substantial
competition
within
the
purview
of
section
5219"
or
as
said
by
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
in
regard
to
the
savings
bank,
"how
can
small
mutual
thrift
institutions
operating
in
a
narrow
field
of
home
financing
and
collecting
thrift
savings
established
by
congress
by
the
home
owners'
loan
act
on
the
federal
level
about
1933."
life
breathes
into
them
by
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
to
the
--
for
home
own
--
for
home
own
--
the
bank
board
system."
how
can
these
institutions
created
for
a
particular
public
policy
narrow
one
in
thrift
savings
and
home
financing
and
restricted
to
this
purpose,
really
be
very
damaging
in
their
operation
to
a
--
a
national
bank
and
association.
and
we
simply
say,
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
we're
going
to
look
and
treat
competitive
and
economic
equivalence
the
same
and
if
we
do
that,
we
don't
think
that
we
have
established
an
unreasonable
or
unfriendly
competition
with
the
business
of
national
bank
or
have
discouraged
people
from
investing
in
national
bank
shares.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
your
honor.
they
are
treated
--
state
banks,
national
banks
and
trust
companies
all
three
are
under
the
same
tax,
the
5
1/2-mill
tax.
now,
state
banks
pay
some
of
the
miscellaneous
tax
that
i
referred
to
and
trust
companies
do
that
national
banks
are
immune
from.
and
prior
to
1952
and
prior
to
this
amendment,
national
banks
were
--
would
escape
--
were
escaping
taxation
to
the
extent
of
the
--
the
general
tax
--
taxes
imposed
plus
this
4
mill
corporate
franchise
privilege
thing.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
pardon?
mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
the
--
the
state
felt
--
the
state
could
not
subject
them
to
a
corporate
privilege
tax.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
this
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
your
honor
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no.
the
--
the
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right,
right.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
sir,
your
honor.
we
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
this
is
not
--
this
is
--
i
--
i'm
sorry.
the
--
the
policy
i
have
referred
to
was
what
is
called
the
partial
exemption
rule,
your
honor.
we
simply
mean
as
stated
by
this
court
on
very
--
in
various
decisions
cited
and
quoted
at
length
as
shown
in
our
brief,
that
the
state
can
prefer
or
exempt
tax
wise,
some
other
moneyed
capital
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--
without
or
--
or
for
just
reason
and
for
public
policy
purposes,
for
instance,
the
purpose
of
trying
to
foster
thrift
savings
and
home
ownership
under
a
savings
and
loan
set
up.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
this
is
--
this
is
not
--
had
nothing
to
do
with
size
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--
but
--
you
mean
for
an
example
of
it
is
was
part
of
the
first
application
of
the
partial
exemption
rule
and
the
most
obvious
was
the
exemption
of
united
states
government
bonds
in
the
hands
of
private
individuals.
this
court
said,
"well
obviously,
congress
didn't
intend
because
the
states
could
not
tax
national
bonds
in
the
hands
of
private
bankers
or
individuals
to
invalidate
a
share
tax
by
reference
to
section
5219."
mr.
william
d.
dexter
right.
for
instance,
put
it
this
way,
say
that
--
say
that
you
have
within
a
state,
150
competitive
units
or
of
other
moneyed
capital
in
competition
with
the
business
of
banks
and
say
that
some
of
these
were
held
by
associations
or
institutions
that
the
state
wanted
to
favor,
say
there
was
five
of
them.
this
court
has
said,
"this
is
alright
so
long
as
it's
for
just
cause."
it
is
partial,
it's
only
5
out
of
the
150
and
it
is
not
--
does
not
result
in
an
unfriendly
or
hostile
discrimination
against
the
banks
which
is
the
real
crux
of
the
meaning
of
section
5219.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
sir,
your
honor.
in
fact
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
--
the
michigan
bankers
association
is
solidly
behind
the
state
of
michigan
in
this
litigation.
now
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
now,
it's
--
it's
--
now,
all
of
390
banks
in
michigan
are
also
members
of
that.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
state
and
national
banks
and
the
act
9
in
the
michigan
public
acts
of
1953
hereunder
challenged,
was
drafted
by
the
taxation
committee
of
the
michigan
bankers
association
and
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
and
–
what,
both,
representing
both
banks
and
was
placed
in
the
statute
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
financial
institutions
in
michigan,
generally
on
the
same
position
tax
wise
and
competitive
wise.
now,
this
is
referred
to
at
--
at
length
in
our
brief,
the
exact
statement
of
the
bankers
association
in
regard
to
their
involvement
is
here.
i
know
the
appellant
says
that
he
is
representing
a
minority
group,
that
the
bankers
association
does
not
speak
for
the
banks,
but
are
--
certainly
are
examination
of
the
question,
would
lead
me
as
an
officer
of
this
court
to
say
that
there
has
been
no
real
concern
on
the
--
behalf
of
any
banks
except
the
appellant
over
this
tax
situation.
and
essentially,
that
appellant's
argument
is
directed
to
the
competition
referred
to
by
the
comptroller
over
obtaining
savings
dollars.
that
the
court
in
the
hoeing
case
was
not
competition,
a
deposit
money,
within
the
purview
of
section
5219.
i
think
this
court
might,
although
there
is
competition
in
the
residential
mortgage
field,
note
that
congress
is
continually
involving
themselves
in
making
available,
more
money
for
residential
mortgage
purposes
and
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
up
to
the
appellant's
liquidity
requirements,
they
had
this
need
for
investment
of
theirs
--
well
filled.
i'm
sure
also
that
the
basic
reason
for
congress
in
enacting
section
5219,
namely
to
prevent
the
discouragement
of
investments
in
national
bank
stocks
is
absent
in
this
case.
the
appellant
is
not
having
any
trouble
of
getting
people
to
buy
its
stock
and
has
never
offered
any
for
sale
and
it
was
essentially
to
protect
the
stockholder
and
to
protect
the
national
bank
in
carrying
out
the
monetary
functions
of
the
united
states
government
that
this
court
handed
down
the
case
of
mccollough
versus
maryland.
and
it
was
not
to
concern
itself
with
economic
details
of
how
one
institution
might
buy
against
another
institution
where
there
was
no
allegation
or
no
attempt
to
show
in
any
way
that
the
bank's
business
and
its
fundamental
structure
was
in
any
way
being
impaired.
this
kind
of
statement
also
appears
generally
in
the
opinions
of
this
honorable
court.
i
would
like
to
move
to
one
which
may
amount
to
possibly
an
illuminating
part
of
our
position
and
that
is
what
congress
has
actually
done
in
reference
to
the
taxation
of
these
two
institutions.
now,
the
savings
and
loan
associations
here
in
question,
the
state
associations
were
patterned
directly
after
the
federal
associations
which
were
created
in
1933
by
the
congress
under
the
federal
home
owners'
loan
act.
and
in
that
legislation,
congress
spelled
out
the
purpose
of
that
--
of
the
creation
of
the
federal
home
owners'
loan
--
creation
of
the
federal
savings
and
loan
institutions
under
this
statute
and
it
there
said
that
such

shall
loan
their
funds
only
on
the
security
of
their
shares

the
security
of

mr.
william
d.
dexter
well,
i
will
apologize
for
its
size,
but
there's
only
one.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
we're
on
pages
15
and
16,.
congress
spells
out
generally,
what
they
have
done
in
reference
to
the
creation
of
federal
savings
and
loan
associations.
now,
the
state
associations
in
question
are
patterned
identically
after
these
federal
associations
and
our
statutory
analysis
in
our
brief
will
indicate
that.
but
then
on
page
17
of
our
brief,
congress
made
it
abundantly
clear
what
it
was
going
to
require
of
the
states
in
reference
to
the
taxation
of
these
mutual
thrift
institutions.
it
there
said,
"no
state
territorial
county,
municipal
or
local
taxing
authority
shall
impose
any
tax
on
such
associations
or
their
franchise
capital
reserve
surplus
loans
or
income
greater
than
that
imposed
by
such
authority
on
other
similar,
local,
mutual
or
cooperative
thrift
in
home
financing
institutions."
now,
we
maintain
that
congress
in
--
in
1933,
contrary
to
the
appellant's
contention,
set
forth
the
purpose
of
these
institutions
and
told
the
states
what
norm
to
use
in
taxing
them.
now
we
simply
assert
that
this
is
in
pari
materia
legislation,
it
must
be
read
in
conjunction
with
section
5219
and
that
the
states
only
have
to
concern
themselves
in
taxing
mutual
institutions
like
this,
with
similar
mutual
institutions
and
not
with
what
is
done
with
national
banks.
now,
it's
interesting
to
know
what
congress
did
in
reference
to
providing
for
the
taxation
of
both
the
joint
land
banks
and
the
national
agricultural
credit
associations.
the
taxation
provisions
were
relative
to
--
those
two
associations
is
set
out
on
page
159
of
the
brief.
now,
there,
congress
tied
in
to
5219
and
to
the
taxation
of
national
bank
stocks,
the
taxation
of
the
stock
of
joint-stock
land
banks
and
the
stock
of
national
agricultural
credit
corporations.
in
other
words,
a
stock-type
institution
operating
in
the
financial
field
created
by
congress
was
tied
into
5219
language
and
test,
while
a
mutual
institution
such
as
the
savings
and
loan
association
was
--
was
related
to
an
entirely
different
kind
of
test.
in
the
treatment
of
the
savings
and
loan
associations
under
the
federal
income
tax
law,
which
has
been
a
subject
by
the
way,
of
much
controversy
between
banks
and
savings
and
loan
associations,
congress
saw
fit
to
treat
and
classify
these
two
institutions
decidedly
different.
in
reference
to
the
savings
and
loan
associations,
they
created
a
bad
debt
reserve
of
12%
of
the
income
of
these
institutions
and
also
permitted
the
institutions
to
deduct
their
dividends
to
their
shareholders
in
the
same
way
as
banks
were
permitted
to
deduct
the
interest
paid
to
their
depositors.
also,
congress,
when
it
created
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
and
insured
people
who
placed
their
moneys
on
deposit
in
banks
against
laws,
also
saw
fit
to
treat
by
analogy,
an
investment
or
a
deposit
in
a
savings
and
loan
share
account
and
this
was
done
by
the
federal
savings
and
loan
insurance
corporation.
congress
again
treat
in
this
mutual
fund
of
a
savings
and
loan
association
that
has
no
equity
capital
and
has
not
stock,
the
equivalent
with
the
bank
deposit
which
is
the
kind
of
equation
the
state
believes
to
be
equitable
and
fair
in
this
cause.
also,
congress,
in
legislating
in
the
district
of
columbia,
according
to
the
appellant's
theory
of
equality,
is
now
discriminating
3
to
1
against
the
gross
income
of
national
banking
institutions
in
the
district.
and
in
1923,
this
statute,
section
5219
was
amended
by
the
congress
and
considered
in
detail
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
richmond
case
in
256
u.s.
and
the
congressional
record
there
shows
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
this
court's
treatment
of
mutual
savings
banks
and
other
mutual
institutions
as
being
without
the
purview
of
section
5219.
and
that
also,
this
court
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
court
had
concluded
in
the
clement
national
bank
case
that
bank
deposits
were
not
within
the
protection
of
section
5219.
and
thus,
in
the
1923
amendment,
congress
again
by
not
making
any
provision
to
overrule
the
judicial
pronouncement
of
this
court,
again
made
it
manifest
and
abundantly
clear
that
they
were
not
going
to
compare
a
savings
and
loan
share
account
with
a
--
with
a
share
of
national
bank
stock
for
section
5219
purposes.
admittedly,
as
appellant
says,
it
is
a
share
of
stock,
but
a
"tree"
is
also
a
tree.
in
the
instant
case,
there's
no
equity
that
a
person
can
possibly
obtain
by
placing
a
dollar
with
a
savings
and
loan
share
account.
these
savings
and
loan
associations
stand
ready
and
open
to
accept
other
depositors
on
the
same
level,
on
the
same
basis
as
their
existing
depositors.
if
a
person
withdraws
the
money,
only
thing
that
they
can
withdraw
under
the
federal
statute
and
the
michigan
statute
is
the
dollar
that
they
put
in
plus
dividends
paid
out
of
current
earnings.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
this
is
right,
your
honor
and
we
have
said
that
this
court
has
so
stated
and
we
are
saying
that
congress
has
treated
the
two
institutions
traditionally
different
and
that
now,
we're
trying
to
bring
together
mechanically,
by
a
mechanical
interpretation
of
5219
under
the
hartford
case
ignoring
100
years
of
history
in
legislation
of
this
court.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
no,
your
honor,
but
we
say
that
it
manifest
a
congressional
intent
not
because
--
remember,
we
have
here
two
federal
institutions.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
this
is
right,
your
honor.
i
mean,
in
other
words,
we
see
a
consistent
pattern
of
decisions
of
this
court
ruling
out
mutual
savings
bank,
savings
deposit,
savings
and
loan
association
up
to
the
hoeing
case,
up
to
the
shreveport
case
of
this
court
of
1933,
up
to
the
tradesmens
case
by
this
court
in
1940,
we
--
and
we
see
paralleling
that
a
congressional
enactment
that
would
support
it.
and
essentially
then,
we
are
saying
that
--
that
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
they
do
not
consider
a
mutual
institution
such
as
they
created
under
the
home
owners'
loan
act
of
1933,
comparable
to
a
--
a
savings
and
loan
--
comparable
to
a
national
bank
capital,
which
is
protected
by
5219.
mr.
william
d.
dexter
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
very
much
like
to
comment
on
that.
number
one,
the
associations
that
i
have
just
referred
to
in
regard
to
public
policy,
were
created
in
1933
by
congress
and
so,
his
assertion
that
there's
no
public
policy
reason
for
distinct
treatment
of
these
institutions
is
rather
belied
by
what
congress
actually
did
in
1933
and
what
kind
of
institution
that
they
said
they
were
creating
under
the
general
welfare
clause.
and
also,
the
testimony
in
this
cause
clearly
indicates
that
the
changes
that
he
is
talking
about
are
changes
of
form
without
substance
that
the
--
essence
of
their
mutuality
is
that
they
have
no
stock.
there
are
a
mutual
concern
corporation
or
a
mutual
body
and
that
it
is
a
vehicle
created
expressly
by
congress
and
for
the
states
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
thrift
savings
and
home
ownership
and
there
has
not
been
in
the
record
of
this
cause
that
would
lead
anyone
to
assume
that
an
established
public
policy
of
100
years
should
now
be
set
aside.
and
i
should
say
in
this
connection
that
there
are
--
were
several
cases
in
the
--
in
this
court
involving
the
status
of
mutual
savings
bank
under
5219
and
each
time
the
bank
came
before
this
court,
they
argued
that
now,
we
have
a
--
institution
different
in
character,
different
in
scope
than
--
that
of
the
other
institutions
that
the
court
ruled
upon
in
the
prior
decisions.
now,
i
might
say
in
closing
that
there
is
one
aspect
of
the
whole
area
that
the
appellant
has
failed
to
note,
in
terms
of
trying
to
possibly
bring
section
5219
up
to
date
and
that
is
that
in
1864
when
the
statute
we're
talking
about
was
first
enacted,
banks'
capital
--
equity
capital
amounted
to
60%
of
their
employable
assets.
in
1919
and
around
the
time
of
the
mercantile
case
--
mr.
william
d.
dexter
in
1919
at
the
time
of
the
mercantile
case,
the
ratio
was
40
to
60
and
in
1952,
the
capital
of
the
bank
were
now
talking
to
has
a
ratio
of
4%
to
the
total
employable
assets
of
that
institution.
i
thank
you
very
much.
