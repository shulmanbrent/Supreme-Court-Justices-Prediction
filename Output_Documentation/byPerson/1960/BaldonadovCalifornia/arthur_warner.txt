mr.
arthur
warner
yes
sir.
i'm
sorry
sir,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
mr.
arthur
warner
i
represent
mrs.
duncan
with
respect
to
--
and
my
discussion
will
be
limited
to
(voice
overlap)
mr.
arthur
warner
i
believe
it
is,
sir.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes
your
honor.
both
the
(inaudible)
brief
and
reply
brief.
second
--
mr.
arthur
warner
that's
another
case,
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
warner
i'm
in
second
position
on
the
other.
mr.
arthur
warner
now
--
because
of
the
dissipation
of
the
time,
i'm
going
to
be
relatively
brief
and
i'm
going
to
devote
the
remarks
to
following
proposition,
the
petitioner's
right
to
a
fair
trial
was
denied
by
the
manner
in
which
the
constituency
of
the
jury
was
established.
i'm
going
to
start
with
your
honors'
permission
by
reading
from
pages
6
and
7
of
the
reply
opposing
brief,
part
of
the
examination
of
voir
dire.
mr.
arthur
warner
the
petitioner's
closing
brief
in
duncan,
187.
i
--
ordinarily
i
wouldn't
read
it
to
the
court
that's
in
there
but
i
think
it
sets
the
stage.
it
establishes
the
moot
of
the
trial
court's
mental
process
as
an
overruling
the
challenges
for
cause
which
later
will
be
referred
to
in
this
short
discussion.
now
during
this
examination,
this
lady,
juror
dodge,
stated
that
she
believed
the
defendant
to
be
guilty
and
that
she
would
require
evidence
to
remove
that
opinion.
then
the
examination
concluded,
the
end
of
it
was
as
follows.
the
court,
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
you
would
require
the
defendant
to
prove
anything,
do
you?
the
defendant
is
not
required
to
prove
anything
under
the
law.
this
respective
juror
-
i
realized
that
judge
blackstat,
yes.
the
court
-
but
you
said,
i
go,
that's
the
court
language,
that
you
would
need
some
testimony
from
the
defendant.
mr.
gustafson,
the
district
attorney
-
your
honor,
the
question
she
answered
was
that
she
would
need
some
evidence
to
remove
her
opinion.
the
juror
-
opinion.
the
court
-
but
she
indicated
at
one
time
that
she
would
require
some
evidence
from
the
defendant
to
remove
that
opinion,
didn't
you?
the
prospective
juror
-
that's
right.
i
said
that.
the
court
-
you
did
that,
didn't
you?
the
prospective
juror
-
i
said
that.
the
court
-
you
still
feel
that
way.
the
prospective
juror
-
yes
sir.
now
it
appears
--
mr.
arthur
warner
she
didn't
sit.
mr.
arthur
warner
that's
right.
no
but
that's
not
--
that
isn't
the
--
mr.
arthur
warner
because
the
reason,
the
mental
processes
of
the
trial
court
in
excusing
this
juror
makes
one
skeptical
as
to
how
this
trial
court
applied
the
law
with
respect
to
the
rest
of
the
juror
that's
in
this
case
and
this
is
what
i'm
going
to
point
out
to
the
court
with
its
permission.
immediately
upon
the
termination
of
this
voir
dire
examination,
the
court
stated
as
follows.
this
is
the
last
challenge.
if
he
had
to
use
a
challenge
on
this
juror,
it
would
be
his
last
challenge.
i
think
i
will
allow
this
challenge.
mr.
arthur
warner
i
don't
know.
i
have
my
opinion.
i
believe
--
well
i
better
not
state
what
i
believe.
mr.
arthur
warner
excu
--
mr.
arthur
warner
yes.
but
the
reason
for
it
is
not
because
this
juror
was
obviously
disqualified
from
serving
constitutionally
because
she
was
unable
to
accept
a
hypothesis
or
any
hypothesis
that
included
a
presumption
of
innocence
for
the
defendant
and
she
was
unable
to
--
to
disabuse
her
mind
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
required
to
produce
evidence
to
establish
her
innocence.
now
with
her
hypothesis,
it
didn't
or
doesn't
require
a
metal
giant
to
realize
that
this
juror,
without
any
argument,
was
constitutionally
disqualified
from
serving
on
any
case
let
alone
a
capital
case.
but
the
--
mr.
arthur
warner
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes.
mr.
arthur
warner
i'm
going
to
establish
that
but
in
order
to
establish
here
your
honor,
i
must
indicate
the
mental
processes
of
the
court
because
i
--
mr.
arthur
warner
alright.
mr.
arthur
warner
alright.
well,
perhaps
i
--
mr.
arthur
warner
not
objectively
but
i
can
give
you
the
hypothesis
with
separate
--
mr.
arthur
warner
that's
right
–
mr.
arthur
warner
that's
what
i
intend
to
do.
mr.
arthur
warner
i
--
that's
exactly
what
i
have
on
my
finger
on
right
now.
mr.
arthur
warner
--
literally,
on
this
piece
of
paper.
i
am
now
going
to
concern
myself
with
four
jurors,
named,
porter,
barice,
sabadra
and
flynn.
now
(inaudible)
the
testimony
on
voir
dire,
this
is
what
happened.
with
respect
to
juror
porter,
as
a
result
of
discussions
with
specific
people,
20,
15,
or
20
people,
and
from
what
he
read,
he
believed
that
the
petitioner,
that
mrs.
duncan
was
guilty,
that
the
opinion
was
such,
that
the
evidence,
that
evidence
would
be
required
to
overcome
it.
and
that
if
his
wife
or
a
member
of
his
family
were
on
trial
for
the
same
offense,
he
wouldn't
trust
the
fate
of
his
wife
or
member
of
the
family
with
jurors
or
to
the
judgment
of
jurors
who
were
in
the
same
frame
of
mind
if
he
--
that
he
was.
now
undoubtedly,
that
juror
was
uncon
--
or
constitutionally
disqualified
from
sitting,
both
under
the
so-called
rehabilitation
statute
to
which
reference
is
made
in
the
--
both
briefs,
and
under
the
federal
criteria
established
by
decisions
of
this
court
going
back
many
years,
i
don't
have
to
press
that
point
at
all.
now
with
juror
sabadra,
the
second
of
the
four
jurors,
practically
the
same
hypothesis
existed
with
the
additional
fact
that
outside
of
the
courtroom
she
had
expressed
her
opinion
of
guilt
and
that
becomes
material
and
important
because
of
the
criteria
this
court
and
these
cases
to
which
i
just
referred
well
at
the
rehabilitation
statute
of
california.
juror
flynn
had
indicated
his
belief
of
the
defendant's
guilt
from
discussions
with
persons
from
what
he
had
read.
he
believed
the
defendant
to
be
guilty.
he
had
discussed
the
case
with
many
people,
possibly
some
of
them
might
have
been
witnesses
or
potential
witnesses.
the
same
hypothesis
exists
with
juror
barice.
now
these
jurors
had
entered
the
box
with
opinions
as
to
the
defendant's
guilt.
on
initial
examination,
they
maintained
those
opinions.
they
stated
there
--
a
close
reading
or
a
close
analysis
of
the
voir
dire
examination
would
indicate
the
solidity
or
practical
--
practically
a
solidity
of
feeling.
it
was
--
it
was
solified
--
solidified
in
their
minds.
now
the
district
attorney
apparently
under
the
guise
of
rehabilitation
under
section
1076
of
the
california
penal
code
posed
some
questions
to
these
four
jurors.
the
questions
were
leading
questions
and
not
only
were
they
leading
questions
but
they
were
framed
in
such
manner
that
if
the
answers
were
not
given
as
suggested
the
juror
would
hold
themselves
out
to
be
an
irresponsible
and
unmoral
citizen.
and
i
have
set
forth
on
pages
32
and
33
and
34
and
35
of
the
opening
brief,
the
type
of
question
that
the
district
attorney
had
propounded
to
allude
to
obtain
a
declaration
from
these
witnesses
under
the
section
1076
that
they
could
sit
impartially
and
decide
the
case
pursuant
to
the
instructions
of
the
court.
mr.
arthur
warner
no.
mr.
arthur
warner
well
i
do
--
i
fail
to
see
how
any
particular
question
set
forth
on
these
pages
by
itself
would
amount
to
misconduct
merely
asking
the
juror
by
--
they
may
--
there
may
have
been
objection
of
us
being
leading
--
mr.
arthur
warner
because
the
district
attorney
in
this
case
was
a
very
competent
and
clever
man.
mr.
arthur
warner
but
the
attorneys
on
the
other
side
had
a
different
standard
of
conduct.
i'll
explain
it
that
way.
mr.
arthur
warner
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
warner
the
record
is
replete.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes,
these
four.
i
believe
the
brief
--
the
brief.(voice
overlap)
mr.
arthur
warner
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
warner
now
--
mr.
arthur
warner
it
well
--
mr.
arthur
warner
yes
because
the
court
had
overruled
petitioner's
objection
for
court.
mr.
arthur
warner
well
the
judge
made
no
comment
about
these,
but
the
--
the
--
mr.
arthur
warner
well
the
--
the
--
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
as
to
these
four
jurors.
mr.
arthur
warner
that
they
were
qualified
to
sit.
now
--
mr.
arthur
warner
yes.
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
on
this
case,
the
defendant
was
required
to
utilize
four
of
her
preemptory
challenges
to
excuse
these
jurors
from
the
box
who
should
have
undeniably
been
excused
for
cause.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes.
that's
what
we
--
they
seek
to
establish
in
our
briefs
that
because
she
was
wrongfully
deprived
of
four,
at
least,
four
preemptory
challenges
with
respect
to
this
group
of
four,
she
was
unable
to
deal
with
three
other
jurors
who
were
permitted
to
remain
in
the
jury
box.
mr.
arthur
warner
in
those
words
--
mr.
arthur
warner
the
record
--
the
record
and
--
will
not
contain
those
words
but
will
contain
a
situation
from
which
that
is
definitely
spelled
out.
mr.
arthur
warner
now
--
mr.
arthur
warner
yes
we
did,
sir.
mr.
arthur
warner
well
the
supreme
court
made
a
finding
as
to
the
four
jurors
just
the
four
jurors
said
nothing
about
these
three
jurors
who
sat
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
using
a
favored
expression
that
some
state
courts
held
that
the
trial
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
overruling
the
objections
for
cause
to
the
four
jurors
that
we
have
just
discussed.
mr.
arthur
warner
well
it
is
a
finding
that
is
not
borne
out
by
the
record
and
it
is
a
finding
in
defiance
and
in
derogation
of
these
holdings
of
the
california
supreme
court
and
appellate
court
decisions
over
a
period
of
80
years.
because
for
a
period
of
80
years,
the
california
courts
have
held
that
where
a
prospective
juror
has
an
opinion
and
that
opinion
is
based
partly
or
entirely
upon
sources
other
than
general
circulating
reading
material
or
common
rumor,
he
cannot
be
rehabilitated,
he's
a
disqualified
juror,
he's
not
a
juror
that
constitutionally
sit.
and
the
supreme
court
has
gone
further
and
stated
that
where
it
is
unclear
whether
this
juror
had
predicated
his
opinion
partly
upon
sources
other
than
general
rumor
or
common
circulating
reading
material,
when
that
hypothesis
is
not
clear,
then
he
cannot
be
qualified
because
this
section
1076
which
permits
a
so-called
rehabilitation
is
in
derogation
of
the
common
law
under
which,
of
course,
no
juror
who
has
expressed
an
opinion
at
any
time
can
be
qualified
or
rehabilitated.
mr.
arthur
warner
now
merely
the
violation,
no.
the
--
inconsistent
rulings
by
state
court,
it
doesn't
give
rise
to
denial
of
due
process.
they
can
reverse
their
position
and
then
--
mr.
arthur
warner
supposedly
20.
mr.
arthur
warner
actually
she
--
by
--
by
rule
of
the
court,
she
was
granted
16,
she
was
denied
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
arthur
warner
we
have
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
warner
the
--
which
one
your
honor?
mr.
arthur
warner
in
california
in
the
appellate
court,
the
first
appellate
court
that
was
hit
with
this
brief
in
this
argument
and
that
was
the
supreme
court.
it
was
a
direct
appeal
from
the
--
mr.
arthur
warner
no,
partially
in
the
opening
brief
and
partially
on
the
reply
brief.
mr.
arthur
warner
in
this
manner,
we
emphasized
and
delineated
the
facts
concerning
the
four
jurors
that
they
were
constitutionally
unfit,
that
preemptory
challenges
have
to
be
utilized
which
shouldn't
have
been
utilized
that
the
petitioner
was
deprived
the
four
--
four
such
challenges
needlessly
and
therefore,
she
was
prejudiced.
she
--
then
in
the
reply
brief,
after
the
attorney
general
had
denied
that
the
denial
of
these
preemptory
challenges
had
constituted
a
prejudice
in
the
reply
brief,
we
continued
by
showing
the
--
the
circumstances
of
the
proceeding
of
these
three
jurors,
their
mental
processes,
their
disqualification,
and
their
--
the
petitioner's
inability
to
deal
with
these
jurors
because
of
the
wrongful
deprivation
of
four
preemptory
challenges.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
warner
i
believe
we
did.
i
--
i
--
mr.
arthur
warner
well
--
mr.
arthur
warner
i
just
recall.
i
just
recalled.
mr.
arthur
warner
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
generally,
that
was
set
forth
the
denial
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
particulars
of
the
argument
as
i
purported
to
give
them
here
and
perhaps
in
a
feeble
manner,
were
not
set
forth
in
detail,
but
the
--
the
result
or
the
conclusion
that
i
arrived
at
here
was
set
forth
in
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
arthur
warner
no.
mr.
arthur
warner
oh
--
to
any
of
the
12
sitting,
no.
there
was
no
objection.
if
your
honor
means
by
a
challenge
for
cause
--
mr.
arthur
warner
by
overt
acts,
yes,
not
by
a
specific
challenge
for
cost.
mr.
arthur
warner
because
immediately
upon
the
acceptance
of
the
jury
by
the
district
attorney,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
or
mrs.
duncan
moved
for
a
change
of
venue.
he
refused
to
okay
the
jury
in
plain
language.
he
didn't
accept
it.
mr.
arthur
warner
alright,
on
page
673,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
warner
beginning
--
perhaps,
either
10
lines
in
the
bottom.
mr.
gustafson
passed
for
cause
and
continued
it
down.
mr.
arthur
warner
72
--
672
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
warner
i
didn't
mean
to
say
673.
mr.
arthur
warner
well
not
any
single
but
practically
all
of
them
and
i'm
going
to
quote
the
following
language.
at
this
time
your
honor,
i
want
to
renew
my
motion
for
removal,
change
of
venue
to
another
county
upon
the
grounds
that
as
it
is
apparent
from
the
voir
dire
examination
of
the
jurors
who
have
been
examined,
the
perspective
jurors
who
have
been
examined
for
the
last
one
and
a
half
days
that
my
client
cannot
receive
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
in
this
county.
then
he
goes
on
to
say,
“i
think
it
is
apparent
from
the
voir
dire
examination
that
the
vast
majority
of
perspective
jurors
who
have
been
called
on
this
jury
box
and
have
been
examined
on
voir
dire
have
formed
an
opinion
adverse
to
elizabeth
duncan.
now
that
includes
everybody
that
was
examined.
that
includes
the
people
sitting
in
the
box
and
the
people
who
were
not
sitting
on
the
box
your
honor
and
this
overt
act
of
mr.
sullivan,
of
defense
counsel,
in
refusing
to
accept
the
jury
and
made
immediately
moving
for
a
change
of
venue
is
more
significant
than
words
that
may
come
from
his
mouth
that
we
challenge
for
cause
or
something
equivalent.
mr.
arthur
warner
yeah.
well,
the
--
of
course
upon
the
--
the
completion
of
the
jury
and
upon
the
exhaustion
of
20
preemptory
challenges,
defense
counsel
was
no
position
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
to
--
to
issue
a
challenge
for
cause.
he
would
have
prejudiced
his
client.
mr.
arthur
warner
well
the
--
the
--
mr.
arthur
warner
well
--
no,
no,
your
honor,
may
i
point
this
out?
that
--
that
the
counsel,
all
through
this
record
has
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
he
was
using
preemptory
challenges
when
he
did
--
he
shouldn't
have.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes,
i
believe
he
did.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes
he
did.
mr.
arthur
warner
i
will
have
to
leave
that
--
mr.
arthur
warner
first
time
your
honor.
that
would
be
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
arthur
warner
well
in
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
arthur
warner
page
--
co-counsel
just
directed
my
attention
to
page
80
of
the
record.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes,
in
the
duncan
case
number
187.
mr.
arthur
warner
8
--
8
--
80
your
honor.
and
the
--
under
paragraph
15,
the
second
paragraph
under
number
--
mr.
arthur
warner
i
believe
it
is
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes.
i
--
i
don't
suspect
that
trial
practice
in
the
court
when
things
are
done
hurriedly
that
you
specifically
set
forth
niceties
of
argument.
the
general
procedure
is
to
preserve
the
record
by
a
general
objection
under
the
applicable
constitutional
provision
and
that's
been
done
here.
mr.
arthur
warner
well,
out
of
context
yes
but
in
context,
in
connection
with
the
--
with
the
arrest
--
with
the
allegation
and
the
motion
and
for
defense
arguments,
it's
apparent
that
this
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
contemplated
the
matter
of
the
jurors.
mr.
arthur
warner
well,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
we
purport
to
make
that
a
federal
question
his
refusal
to
instruct.
mr.
arthur
warner
well,
as
i
stated
to
mr.
justice
douglas,
out
of
context
i
had
no
answer
but
in
context,
the
proceedings
that
--
the
matters
that
preceded
and
the
matters
that
succeeded
this,
it's
apparent
that
the
only
matter
involved
as
far
as
due
process
was
concerned
at
that
time
was
a
matter
of
a
selection
of
the
jurors.
i
--
i
think
it's
well
established
practice
and
your
honor
knows
from
the
california
practice
that
you
usually
state
that
set
forth
statutory
grounds
and
under
those
statutory
grounds
you
can
later
expand
and
include
the
things
in
a
more
definite
manner.
now
i
--
i
think
that's
a
proof
procedure
and
i
think
that
in
taking
this
in
(inaudible)
or
proposing
it
or
considering
in
context,
there's
no
other
interpretation
as
susceptible
except
that
everybody
knew
as
a
practical
--
practical
matter
that
we
were
talking
about
the
manner
in
which
the
jurors
were
selected.
i
believe
that
unless
there
are
any
pertinent
questions,
i
believe
i
overstepped
--
mr.
arthur
warner
no.
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
question.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes.
it
probably
would.
so
unless
this
court
wants
to
make
further
inquiry
of
me,
i
would
--
a
deference
to
the
co-counsel
(voice
overlap)
an
issue
to
retire.
mr.
arthur
warner
not
entirely.
it
omitted,
it
didn't
make
--
mr.
arthur
warner
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
warner
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes
sir.
mr.
arthur
warner
i
believe
we
contended
generally
although
not
as
much
as
--
mr.
arthur
warner
yes.
mr.
arthur
warner
i've
just
been
instructed
or
advised
that
they
have
been
filed.
mr.
arthur
warner
yes
sir
with
the
court
reporter.
mr.
arthur
warner
thank
you.
