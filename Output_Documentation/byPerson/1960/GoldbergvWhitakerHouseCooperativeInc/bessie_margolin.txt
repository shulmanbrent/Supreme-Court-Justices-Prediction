ms.
bessie
margolin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
question
of
the
application
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
two
homeworkers
in
an
industry
with
a
history
as
old
as
the
act
itself,
of
various
efforts
to
avoid
the
application
of
the
act
to
its
homeworkers.
in
terms
of
the
facts
to
this
specific
case,
the
question
is
whether
such
homeworkers
in
this
industry
and
similar
industries,
by
joining
a
cooperative
which
was
initiated
and
sponsored
and
--
and
in
no
material
essentials
managed
and
is
continuing
to
be
so
managed
by
their
former
employers
are
transformed
into
independent
self-employed
producers,
so
as
to
remove
them
from
the
regulation
of
the
act.
the
courts
below
held
that
since
the
cooperative
and
that
as
found
by
the
trial
court,
it
was
a
bona
fide
member
controlled
cooperative.
that
this
was
petition
to
distinguish
this
case
from
all
previous
cases
in
which
comparable
devices
to
avoid
the
act
that
had
been
condemned.
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
past
status
of
these
homeworkers
as
employees
subject
to
the
act.
they
and
similar
homeworkers
have
throughout
the
years,
consistently
been
so
considered.
and
not
only
have
the
--
the
courts,
prior
to
the
decision
below
in
the
instant
case,
refused
to
sanction
all
the
passed
devices
and
attempts
designed
to
exclude
these
homeworkers
from
the
scope
of
the
act,
but
repeated
efforts
to
secure
exemption
by
specific
legislation
have
failed
throughout
the
years.
the
courts
--
the
--
the
courts
below
didn't
know
what
this
legislative
background
and
expressly
discarded
the
broad
definitions
of
employment
under
this
act
as
being
not
very
helpful.
the
opinions
on
their
face
show
that
very
little
attention
was
paid
to
why
these
homeworkers
have
been
regarded
as
employees
within
the
scope
of
this
act
and
--
or
to
the
background
which
led
to
the
plain
legislative
intent
to
include
them
within
the
scope
of
the
broad
coverage
of
the
statutory
definitions.
the
--
instead
of
looking
at
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
at
the
homeworker
--
the
history
of
the
homeworker
problem
in
this
industry,
the
court
--
the
courts
below
dealt
with
this
--
the
issue
in
this
case,
as
if
it
were
simply
a
rather
technical
question
as
to
who
controlled
this
--
this
cooperative,
which
by
the
way,
was
organized
as
a
separate
legal
entity,
was
incorporated
and
had
the
status
of
a
legal
entity.
the
courts
below
--
the
trial
court
phrased
--
directed
their
attention
to
who
could
--
who
controlled
the
cooperative?
did
--
may
--
may
have
fallen
into
confusion
because
there
was
also
and
still
is
a
question
in
this
case
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
whole
cooperative
was
not
simply
a
sham
or
cloak
to
disguise
the
operations
of
--
of
individual
former
employers
of
homeworkers.
but
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
whether
or
not,
this
was
such
as
a
sham
and
even
if
the
employees
--
the
homeworkers
were
given
some
bone
fide
voice
in
the
operation
of
the
cooperative,
they
are
nonetheless,
still
employees
of
the
cooperative
and
its
managing
officials
under
the
definitions
of
the
--
the
broad
definitions
of
this
act,
which
includes
any
person
acting
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
interest
of
an
employer
and
person
includes
or
individual
partnership,
association,
corporation
or
any
organized
group
of
corporations.
now,
we
submit
that
the
cooperate
--
the
cooperative
certainly
fits
into
that
broad
definition
and
that
as
a
separate
legal
entity
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
the
employer
of
the
homeworkers,
whether
or
not
they
are
also
bona
fide
--
whether
or
not,
they
also
have
bona
fide
membership
rights
and
interest.
now
the
courts
below
distinguished
this
decision
--
this
court's
decision.
they
recognized
and
both
courts
stated
that
it's
clear
that
a
cooperative
can
have
employees,
but
they
said
that
the
employ
--
the
homeworkers
were
not
simply
employees.
they
--
they
were
members
in
that
their
membership
interest
was
identical
with
their
interest
as
--
as
workers
and
that
since
their
interest
as
members
and
producers
were
the
same,
they
were
in
effect,
self-employed.
we
submit
that
this
reasoning
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions
and
that
there's
nothing
in
the
--
even
the
technical
common
law,
which
would
support
the
conclusion
that
the
membership
rights
in
a
separate
entity
of
this
type
are
inconsistent
with
the
workers
being
also
employees.
i
think
--
i
think
this
was
well
illustrated
in
the
rhetorical
questions
asked
by
--
put
by
judge
aldrich
in
his
dissent
below,
when
he
asked
that
if
a
union
were
given
a
voice
in
management,
would
its
members
cease
to
be
employees
and
if
an
employee
acquires
stock
in
a
company
does
he
cease
to
be
an
employee?
the
--
even
in
applying
the
control
test,
the
courts
below
i
think
misconceived
even
conventional
technical
concepts
of
--
of
the
control
that
has
any
relevance
to
the
question
of
an
employment
relationship.
they
concentrated
on
the
--
on
whether
or
not,
the
homeworkers
controlled
the
operation
of
the
cooperation
instead
of
inquiring
into
who
controlled
whether
the
management
of
the
cooperative
control
--
did
not
control
the
members
as
workers.
and
we
submit
that
the
extent
to
which
control
is
relevant
to
the
determination
an
--
of
an
employment
relationship
under
this
act,
that
surely
the
control
exercised
over
the
workers,
the
members
as
workers,
is
much
more
significant
and
pertinent
than
what
control
they
might
have
exercised
over
the
cooperation
as
members.
that
the
status
of
these
homeworkers
as
workers
has
remained
unchanged
since
the
organization
of
this
cooperative,
is
perhaps
best
illustrated
by
a
look
at
the
past
history
of
the
maine
--
of
the
maine
managing
officials
of
this
cooperative,
mrs.
whitaker
who
has
been
the
general
manager
through
-
since
the
organization
of
the
cooperative
and
admittedly
participated
actively
in
its
organization.
ms.
bessie
margolin
in
july
1957.
ms.
bessie
margolin
she,
prior
to
that
time
for
some
years
prior
to
that
time,
had
employed
that
most
of
this
maine
--
the
homeworkers
from
maine,
they
are
now
200
members
of
the
--
of
the
cooperative.
at
the
time
of
its
organization,
only
26
had
signed
the
articles
of
incorporation
and
they
were
all
--
they
were
all
homeworkers
of
mrs.
whitaker's
individual
business.
she
–
the
--
she
became
the
general
manager
almost
immediately
and
i
won't
go
into
the
details
as
to
how
she
and
her
attorney
directed
the
whole
organizational
meeting
at
which
the
articles
of
association
were
adopted
after
having
been
prepared
in
advance
by
attorney,
bird,
and
the
--
all
the
bylaws
also
which
had
been
prepared
in
advance
were
adopted
at
that
same
meeting
and
by
26
--
the
26
homeworkers
and
the
other
two
members
were
mrs.
whitaker
and
mr.
bird,
they
were
28
incorporators
at
all,
altogether.
immediately
that
meeting
elected
a
board
of
directors,
five
homeworkers
--
homeworker
members,
who
had
all
been
homeworkers
at
mrs.
whitaker
and
two
of
them
had
actually
worked
in
her
home
as
trimmers
directly
with
her
previously.
and
that
board
of
directors
then
proceeded
immediately
at
the
--
on
the
same
date
to
elect
the
officers.
it's
not
quite
clear
why
the
board
of
directors
elected
the
officers
since
the
bylaws
provided
for
the
membership
too,
but
they
elected
the
officers
and
mrs.
whitaker
was
elected
general
manager
and
a
cousin
of
her
husband,
a
mr.
kennedy
and
it
nowhere
appears
how
he
became
a
member
or
--
got
into
the
picture
expect
for
his
relationship
to
mrs.
whitaker,
and
his
interest
in
mrs.
whitaker.
and
the
--
mr.
bird
became
president
--
attorney
bird
was
elected
president.
how
--
mrs.
whitaker
immediately
as
soon
as
the
certificate
of
incorporation
was
--
was
filed
with
the
secretary
of
state
of
maine,
which
was
about
a
week
after
the
organizational
meeting
and
it
was
after
mrs.
whitaker
had
been
elected
an
officer,
she
turned
over
her
inventory.
she
says
the
business'
lock,
stock
and
barrel,
but
indications
are
that
she
had
some
accounts
receivable
which
were
not
turned
over,
but
the
business
continued
to
operate
in
her
residence
as
before
and
that
she
became
the
principal
place
of
business
for
the
cooperative.
and
she
continued
to
operate,
she
herself
testified,
continued
to
function
in
the
same
way
as
she
had
in
her
individual
business,
except
that
she
didn't
do
the
selling.
now,
the
interesting
point
about
what
she
had
done
in
her
own
personal
business,
the
interesting
point
about
the
selling
is
that
mrs.
doris
law,
within
a
month
after
the
organization
of
the
cooperative,
was
given
a
contract
as
exclusive
selling
agent
for
the
cooperative.
now,
mrs.
doris
law
had
operated
a
similar
business
with
tennessee
homeworkers,
some
of
whom
are
now
members
of
this
cooperative
and
she
had
been
enjoying
the
month
--
about
a
month
before
the
organization
of
this
cooperative,
she
had
been
enjoined
the
tennessee
from
employing
home
--
her
homeworkers
in
violation
of
the
act.
mrs.
whitaker
had
had
early
connections
with
mrs.
law.
she
had
regularly
for
some
time
prior
to
the
--
when
she
was
in
her
own
business
prior
to
the
organization
of
the
cooperative,
she
had
for
some
time
prior
thereto,
shipped
regularly,
a
substantial
quantities
of
goods
produced
by
her
maine
homeworkers
to
mrs.
law,
who
distributed
them.
so
that
mrs.
law
was
in
effect
--
had
been
in
effect,
a
sales
agent
of
mrs.
whitaker.
now,
another
person
with
a
previous
connection
with
mrs.
whitaker's
business
was
a
mrs.
johnson
who
had
been
a
former
homeworker
of
mrs.
whitaker
and
she
had
supplied
yarn
to
the
homeworkers
of
mrs.
whitaker.
she
joined
the
cooperative
and
she
became
the
source
of
supply
for
the
yarn
to
the
homeworkers
of
the
cooperative.
so
that
the
business
continued
to
all
intents
and
purposes
and
in
all
essentials,
had
continued
to
operate
except
for
the
--
for
the
specific
provisions
and
requirements
as
to
meetings
that
though
with
having
a
cooperative
organization.
the
homeworkers
continued
to
operate
the
same
as
--
and
--
and
the
management
of
it
continued
of
their
work,
continued
the
same
as
it
had
under
mrs.
whitaker's
individual
operation.
the
net
effect
i
think,
it's
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
--
of
the
record,
the
evidence
in
the
record,
is
that
mrs.
whitaker
and
mrs.
law
found
themselves
in
a
situation
with
inventories
on
hand,
when
--
when
the
web
--
web
which
they
had
acquired
while
operating
in
--
under
arrangements
with
homeworkers,
which
it
was
quite
--
which
had
become
quite
clear,
were
not
valid
and
were
in
violation
of
--
of
the
act.
the
--
doris
law
had
already
been
enjoined
from
hiring
--
employing
the
homeworkers
contrary
to
the
regulations
of
the
administrator
and
mrs.
whitaker
undoubtedly
knew
of
that
injunction.
mrs.
--
there
was
another
case
that
was
filed
shortly
thereafter
and
mrs.
whitaker
had
been
inspected
by
the
investigator
and
had
been
advised
that
she
too
was
subject
to
that
--
that
--
in
her
relationship
with
the
homeworkers
was
subject
to
have
--
to
the
law,
so
that
it
is
quite
obvious
that
mrs.
whitaker
and
mrs.
law
were
primarily
motivated
by
an
interest
in
preserving
the
inventories,
which
they
had
on
hand
and
continuing
to
operate
their
business.
ms.
bessie
margolin
in
--
in
the
organization
of
the
cooperative.
and
they
are
the
leading
--
they
are
the
leading
persons
--
have
been
since
the
beginning,
the
leading
--
the
leading
managing
officials,
if
--
if
not
the
only
managing
officials
in
operating
the
cooperative.
now,
the
court
below
--
the
trial
court
made
much
of
the
fact
that
the
bylaws
provided
certain
rights
of
membership
and
control
in
the
homeworkers.
we
submit
that
the
meager
rights
the
homeworkers
had
in
the
membership
control
are
in
no
way
inconsistent
with
their
status
as
employees.
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
the
--
judge
aldrich
in
his
dissent
pointed
out,
most
of
them
with
200
scattered
and
they
were
largely
in
maine
and
tennessee
where
mrs.
whitaker
and
doris
law
had
previously
had
their
individual
businesses
with
a
few
scattered
in
some
nine
out
of
the
states,
where
i
think
the
prospect
is
that
they
will
expand
if
this
--
if
this
arrangement
is
upheld
by
the
court.
the
200
scattered
members
are
--
could
hardly
be
expected
to
attend
the
annual
meetings
in
maine
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
--
most
of
them
never
did
attend.
there
was
--
well,
although
the
bylaws
provided
for
51%
membership
as
a
quorum,
there
never
was
--
that
i
think
there
were
two
or
three
meetings,
one
annual
meeting
and
two
special
meetings,
there
never
was
a
quorum
at
any
one
of
them
--
anywhere
near
a
quorum.
and
they
proceeded
to
do
business
anyway
without
--
obviously
without
meeting
the
legal
requirements.
there
--
mrs.
whitaker
admittedly
as
general
manager
had
authority
under
the
--
the
bylaws
gave
her
authority
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
board
of
directors
to
pass
on
applications
for
membership
which
in
effect,
was
deciding
whether
to
hire
the
homeworkers.
the
homeworkers
had
to
--
in
applying
for
membership,
had
to
purchase
a
sample
of
the
goods
--
of
the
articles
which
the
--
in
which
the
cooperative
dealt
and
to
copy
the
sample
and
to
submit
it
and
mrs.
whitaker
passed
upon
whether
or
not
they
were
qualified
workers.
their
only
proprietary
interest,
financial
interest
was
to
purchase
of
$3
certificate
in
the
cooperative,
which
by
--
under
the
bylaws
did
not
entitle
them
to
any
dividends
nor
subject
them
to
any
liabilities
of
fraud
losses
or
assessments
of
the
cooperative.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
certificate
of
membership
gave
them
the
right
to
vote
in
the
annual
--
to
vote
for
the
directors
in
the
annual
membership
meetings.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
didn't
have
any?
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
bylaws
provided
that
none
--
no
profits
should
be
or
no
dividends
should
be
issued
on
the
certificates.
but
that
after
all
of
the
expenses
and
overheads
and
sales
commissions
and
everything
else
is
paid
the
board
of
directors
may
in
their
discretion,
distribute
any
excess
receipts
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
work
each
member
submitted.
in
other
words,
it
was
in
effect,
they
--
an
increase
--
a
possible
increase
and
it's
very
theoretical
in
the
rates
paid
for
the
work
they
submitted.
ms.
bessie
margolin
in
the
discretion
of
the
board
of
directors
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
--
after
the
costs,
certainly
after
this
point
and
there's
been
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
no.
well,
the
members
elected
the
original
board
of
directors,
but
they've
--
this
was
just
when
26
of
mrs.
whitaker's
homeworkers
were
present.
they
have
never
had
another
election
of
directors.
they've
been
operating
since
with
this
original
board
of
directors
to
the
all
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
think
there
was
two
--
there
were
two
special
meetings
and
one
annual
meeting
and
none
of
them
was
anywhere
near
quorum.
so,
there
has
been
no
legal
election
of
--
if
there'd
been
any
changes
in
the
board
of
directors,
it
was
not
--
i
think
there
has
been
a
couple,
but
it
has
not
been
done
by
--
i'm
sorry,
i
made
a
mistake
of
saying
the
same
board
of
directors,
there
had
been
a
couple
of
changes,
but
it's
been
done
at
this
illegal
--
with
these
meetings
without
any
quorum
and
i
think
that
one
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
one
meeting,
there
were
37
out
at
--
out
of
195
members
present.
in
another
meeting
there
was
--
i
don't
remember
the
precise
figures,
but
it
was
about
the
same
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
did.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
--
yes.
they
--
they
amended
the
bylaws
to
provide
i
think
for
25
persons
to
make
a
quorum.
ms.
bessie
margolin
it
seems
to
me,
that
too
has
some
effect
on
whether
or
not
the
--
this
was
a
bona
fide
number
to
control
the
cooperative.
it
may
have
started
out
originally
with
the
intent
to
give
the
members
way
of
control.
it
was
apparent
that
some
real
voice
and
the
management,
i
don't
think
they
intended
to
give
them
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
original
incorporators
were
all
in
and
around
in
towns
i
think,
within
a
radius
certainly
of
100
miles.
i
believe
that
of
troy,
maine,
mrs.
whitaker's
homeworkers.
the
tennessee
homeworkers
are
some
of
the
same
group
that
mrs.
hall
employed
and
mrs.
law
employed.
that
there
are
also
a
few
homeworker
members,
a
few
scattered
in
about
eight
of
the
states
throughout
the
country.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
meetings
were
held
in
either
waterville
or
troy,
maine.
ms.
bessie
margolin
the
26
original
incorporators
elected
the
original
directors.
and
there
hasn't
been
any
--
any
membership
meeting
with
the
--
with
a
quorum
to
elect
any
other
directors.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
by
the
meetings
without
a
quorum,
to
fill
vacancies
for
resignations.
ms.
bessie
margolin
well,
i
think
it
was
other
business,
other
business
transacted
to
for
example.
they
made
it
--
at
one
of
these
meetings
and
there
was
--
well,
there
was
a
vote
to
change
the
--
the
method
of
payment
of
--
of
the
homeworkers.
and
a
proposal
was
made
that
40%
of
the
amounts
due
then
be
withheld
to
set
up
a
fund
for
--
a
capital
reserve
fund
and
until
the
articles
were
sold.
and
that
the
--
the
members
table
that
and
--
and
a
motion
was
passed
to
--
to
pay
them
at
fixed
periods
every
two
months.
and
prior
to
that
time,
the
--
there
had
been
a
provision
that
these
board
of
directors
voted
to
pay
for
articles
submitted
before
the
10th
of
the
month,
by
the
20th
of
the
month
and
for
articles
submitted
after
the
10th
by
the
20th
of
the
following
month.
interestingly
enough
that
very
provision
was
i
say
interestingly
enough
i
think
understandably,
it
was
taken
from
mrs.
law's
method
of
operation,
her
contracts
with
her
homeworkers
in
tennessee
and
that
appear
in
the
opinion
of
judge
boyd
in
the
law
case,
in
the
case
against
mrs.
law.
mrs.
whitaker
admittedly,
nobody
else
here
knew
anything
about
fixing
--
fixing
the
rates
to
be
paid
for
this
work
and
in
our
reply
brief
we
showed
that
there
were
fixed
rates
for
despite
the
denial
of
counsel
and
that
these
were
in
fact
fixed
by
mrs.
whitaker
with
the
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
board
of
directors
but
is
impractical
matter,
she
fixed
them,
if
i
might
reserve
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
ms.
bessie
margolin
i
just
have
one
point
to
add
in
answer
to
counsel's
question
as
to
how
can
a
group
employ
any
of
themselves
as
a
--
apparently
this
was
the
approach
of
the
court
below
and
i
think
the
very
fact
of
this
case
and
i
will
answer
to
that.
the
cooperative
does
employ
trimmers
as
--
who
are
also
members
and
who
also
have
the
same
degree
of
ownership
as
the
homeworker.
now
what
the
--
and
they
pay
them
$1
an
hour.
the
only
difference
is
that
these
trimmers
work
in
--
on
the
premises
--
mrs.
--
on
the
premises
of
the
cooperative
at
mrs.
whitaker's
residence,
whereas
the
homeworkers
work
their
homes.
in
fact,
mrs.
whitaker
herself
is
a
member
and
yet
she's
employed
as
general
manager
at
a
salary.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes.
we
have
a
twofold
--
we
have
a
twofold
argument
here,
one
that
whether
or
not,
it's
bona
fide.
the
cooperative
and
its
managing
officials
are
in
an
employment
relationship
with
the
homeworkers.
the
second
--
our
second
point
is
that
it
was
clearly
erroneous,
the
finding
that
the
--
it
was
a
bona
fide
member
control
cooperative
is
clearly
erroneous,
yes.
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
are
paid
at
rates
–
there
is
a
schedule
of
rates
in
the
--
in
the
record
at
rates
that
are
fixed
by
mrs.
whitaker,
who
is
the
general
manager,
theoretically
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
board
of
directors
and
they
had
first
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they're
piece
rates.
they're
piece
rates
and
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
for
--
up
for
per
dozen.
it's
usually
at
--
runs
around
for
the
booties,
i
think
around
no
more
than
$8
a
--
a
dozen
for
booties,
it's
usually
less
than
that
and
they
get
paid
just
by
the
piece
--
ms.
bessie
margolin
they
are
paid
--
their
paying
hasn't
been
as
regular
and
recently
as
it
was.
at
first,
they
were
paid
apparently
fairly
regularly
as
they
sent
them
in.
then
recently
the
board
of
directors
passed
a
resolution
that
this
was
a
method
of
controlling
the
submission
of
articles
they
didn't
want.
that
they
would
pay
--
they
called
them
advances,
they
would
pay
for
only
for
articles
that
--
for
which
they
had
orders
on
hand
and
unless
and
until
they
were
--
they're
sold
and
this
was
a
way
of
controlling
the
inventory
and
having
--
having
sent
in
only
articles
for
which
they
had
orders.
ms.
bessie
margolin
yes,
this
was
so
--
this
is
so
in
all
of
these
homeworker
situations.
that's
nothing
--
nothing
different
in
that
respect.
in
fact
here,
they
have
less
freedom
because
the
bylaws
require
them
to
sell
--
forbid
them
--
prohibit
them
from
selling
to
anyone
other
than
the
cooperative
prior
to
the
--
the
prior
arrangements
they
had,
they
could
sell
to
others
and
they
sometimes
did.
but
here,
they're
prohibited
from
selling
to
any
other
business,
any
articles
which
the
--
in
which
the
cooperative
deals.
