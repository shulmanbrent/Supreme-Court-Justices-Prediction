            <text syncTime="29.799" offset="222542">This hearing is on writ of Certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.727" offset="242291">By way of background on February 6, 1965 and about 7:30 in the morning, a small grocery store in Dade County, Florida was robbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.281" offset="280534">One of the prosecuting witnesses indicated that they had had about one to two minutes time to observe the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.086" offset="311672">About a month later, March 1, 1965, the petitioner, Carmine Vincent Palmieri was arrested in his home at about 1:30 in the morning without a warrant and he was taken directly to the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.782" offset="362454">He was not taken before magistrate responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.310" offset="372590">The next day of March 2, 1965, he was placed in a lineup at the jail without counsel where he was identified by Loy Dill, the manager of the restaurant -- the manager of the grocery store.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.129" offset="423894">Again, he had not been taken before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.094" offset="439777">At least one other lineup was held on March 8, 1965 some eight days later at which time the petitioner was again identified by the son of the manager of the grocery store, still, he had been taken before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.710" offset="494216">For 10 days, the petitioner was held without taken before a magistrate, without being arraigned and without benefit of a counsel and not until petitioner had secured counsel and applied for a petition of writ of habeas corpus, was he charged with armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.129" offset="551894">At the trial of this cause the sole incriminating -- the sole evidence used against him was this lineup evidence, this illegal lineup evidence of the two witnesses.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="162.274" offset="752515">I thought in reading the briefs and without calling them that the record did show that he was arrested only after the victim of the holdup had identified his picture -- as the picture of the man who had held him up.</text>

            <label>Mr. Phillip Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="185.265" offset="844466">No, I say this is an argument advanced by that but the record does not reflect that the record reflects on page 15 that they took some photographs of two after the arrest to the prosecuting witness and that he identified one of the photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.774" offset="906428">No less than the record does it say that the person he identified was the petitioner Carmine Vincent Palmieri, no less than the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.189" offset="936103">As a matter of fact is we're going to draw an inference from a solid record.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.330" offset="952717">The record does show that the son was taken down -- the first person who was arrested when the son was taken down he couldn't identify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.265" offset="980407">So, if we're going to make an inference with solid record it is that the photograph which was identified by the father was not that of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.166" offset="1007992">But the record is silent on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.028" offset="1023457">Now, the record reveals and this is a reflection on the lineup that they robber was described initially as a small person, a person of about 130 pounds, about 5'6” and at least one of the lineups -- they've made a lineup where there were no small people in the lineup except the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.314" offset="1088658">And the prosecuting witness indicated that he picked out the smallest person in the lineup which we say goes to the dubious reliability of the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.249" offset="1124394">It is also in the record that the father and the son told the story to the police together and it's also in the record that he had only one to two minutes to observe the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.298" offset="1160547">Now, the state suggest in its brief that the procedure used in the case was similar to a procedure approved by this Court in Simmons versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.403" offset="1192939">I respectfully submit that that just isn't the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.497" offset="1205373">The Simmons case involves the use of a pretrial photograph, the identification of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.195" offset="1224182">It does not involve the use of an illegal lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.677" offset="1242049">Now, despite the continued objections and cross station of petitioner's trial counsel, the illegal lineup evidence was used against the petitioner and as a result although this is important as colloquy in the record it shows that the judge would not allow the jury to hear the discussions as to the defects in the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.854" offset="1318745">But nevertheless, the jury would turn the verdict of guilt and he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.767" offset="1394395">This was before this Denno but I don't want to get in the question of semantics with you Mr. Justice Harlan but I think the question of this Denno decision of the Dennis decision is that there will be no reversals per se of lineups without counsel which took place prior to that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.162" offset="1460015">But it doesn't cure the illegal lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.028" offset="1467434">The lineup was still illegal having been held without counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.496" offset="2021334">An appeal was taken to the Third District Court of Appeal which is in the Florida setup with normally be defined Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.014" offset="2051427">That court's opinion after reviewing the sequence of advance conclude that shows on the face of it that it was upset with the wrongs that had been done in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.939" offset="2095104">But without attempt to be fictitious in any manner that court concluded that under the doctrine of stare decisis that they had previously approved the matters where man had not been taken before magistrates timely while evidence have been gathered against him, they affirmed on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.563" offset="2153618">But they had some reservations and under the Florida Constitution Article V, Section 4, they certified the question to the Supreme Court of Florida and the question of great public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.138" offset="2195937">Under the Supreme Court of Florida, affirmed again and they answered the question that they propounded to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.335" offset="2224671">And this Court also reviewed the sequence of advance and concluded that the petitioner had been wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.397" offset="2248913">But the Supreme Court of Florida went on a basis that was harmless error that he had not been harmed, that had not been prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.773" offset="2278484">And I really could not understand how this result could be reached in the face of the fact that all of the evidence introduced at the trial was the evidence which was developed during the unlawful detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.176" offset="2320071">The court also noted that the petitioner hadn't requested to be taken before a magistrate and based its decision in part on that, actually the record on this point is silent and as this Court have stated in Conley decision, a waiver cannot be inferred, it's not permissive from the silent record.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.195" offset="2396139">The record here is silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.386" offset="2404916">Also in the Conley case, the Court pointed out with respect to assistance of counsel, the assistance of counsel does not turn on a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.618" offset="2437831">And I respectfully submit that by analogy the right to put to hearing before a magistrate should not turn upon a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.396" offset="2468968">Actually, in its brief before this Court, the state continues to rely on the fact of a lack of prejudicial error and as I submitted it before if this man had been taken before a magistrate as required by law under Section 901.23 of the Florida Statutes or if it became a constitutional mandate, he would have been turn loose because all the evidence that was used against him was gathered after that took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.007" offset="2571368">The only other point is the point suggested by Mr. Justice Stewart from that perhaps there had been this identification but as I pointed out in this record, there was no identification of a photograph of this particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.449" offset="2629151">Now we, respectfully --</text>

            <text syncTime="652.822" offset="2714624">Yes, sir, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.765" offset="2722461">Our major point is that the McNabb-Mallory Rule should be applied to state court proceedings as a constitutional mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.006" offset="2755375">Now, as this Court knows that McNabb-Mallory Rule stems with the decision of this Court which holds that if the dependant is unlawfully detained in violation of Rule 5 (a) of the Federal Criminal Rules and Procedure that evidence gathered during that time cannot be used in the conviction based on such evidence will be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.546" offset="2829563">Similar provisions in the form of legislation requiring that arrested person to be promptly taken before magistrate exists and practically every State in the Union I have collected in the footnote of those cases in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.390" offset="2880972">Interestingly enough as that point out in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.820" offset="2890689">Many, many states ignore this as the Florida case does.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.379" offset="2904900">As a matter of fact and I'm sure the Attorney General can tell you since this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.588" offset="2921723">The Supreme Court of Florida has in a number of cases continued to ignore the provisions of 901.23.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.931" offset="2951084">Now, although McNabb-Mallory Rule has been a rule applicable to federal court proceedings, I think its an interesting coincidence that in the case Milton versus Cochran which is a Supreme Court of Florida case, the Supreme Court resided that if it didn't start to do something about stopping this failure to take the man before magistrate that this Court of some other federal court would adopt the McNabb-Mallory Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.726" offset="3050245">And without attempting to be fictitious, I respectfully suggest that the time has come to make a profit out of the Supreme of Florida because the McNabb-Mallory Rule is an essential part of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.675" offset="3098102">In the McNabb case, Mr. Justice Frankfurter and I won't repeat it but he makes an eloquent exposition as to the rational of that case, the public policy behind the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.499" offset="3141360">Certainly, due process requires that the police must with reasonable profits, show legal cause for detaining an arrested person.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.745" offset="3170304">And if this is an important safeguard not only to convict form the innocent but towards actually convicting the guilty in an enlightened society.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.331" offset="3204681">This rational of this case applies certainly to state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.721" offset="3226206">I think it's also interesting that in both McNabb and Mallory decisions, this Court did not reject the constitutional concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.364" offset="3252851">It says that it wasn't getting into it, in other words, it didn't reached the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.686" offset="3270092">And at deciding this question of legislative intent, construction and interpretation of a Rule 5 (a).</text>

            <label>Mr. Phillip Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="841.351" offset="3468727">The Klapp Hold case cited in the Second District case in which this Court denied cert which involved search and seizure other than the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.404" offset="3501014">Now, this is an argument made by the state too.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.587" offset="3509687">It is true that both McNabb and Mallory were confession cases but in fairness because I'm an advocate within and attempting to be objective in reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.590" offset="3549706">The rational of those decisions is the unlawful detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.394" offset="3564962">In other word, this Court has never held of a confession per se as illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.102" offset="3579800">It's only a confession which is gathered under certain circumstances which is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.064" offset="3595577">And the circumstances of McNabb-Mallory is the violation of Rule 5 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="877.313" offset="3612609">Certainly, there's nothing in need of those decision that indicates so that the tainting was something other than a confession that a different result would be reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.493" offset="3645315">But there is that difference in the case you suggest Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.305" offset="3660570">Now, I think as this Court knows, the purpose of a preliminary hearing is to weed out groundless or unsupported charge of grave offenses and to relieve an accused of a degradation and expense of a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.183" offset="3712084">Certainly, a quick determination of probable cause isn't assessed in any esteem of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.424" offset="3733086">The preliminary hearing also serves another purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.614" offset="3741863">It gives an opportunity for bail which is of course a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.328" offset="3756701">It gives the opportunity for counsel being appointed or being retained which is also a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.014" offset="3779480">The fact, that so many of our states, practically all of our states have an active legislation in effect adopting Rule 5 (a) as a part of their own state is indicative of the extent which this is ingrain in our concepts of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.223" offset="3840293">And we respect and submit that under the decisions of this Court certainly the due process provisions required that the State of Florida defendant due process of law not only during the trial period of the former trial but throughout his entire accusatory period.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.064" offset="3895672">I think that was the Escobedo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.151" offset="3903927">And we're suggesting that as a part of that due process requires that a man being taken before a magistrate within a reasonable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.884" offset="3942902">In some case, as you might have an expiration of the outer orbits of what constitutes a reasonable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.261" offset="3968397">I submit you don't have to decide that now because 10 days is certainly an unreasonable period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.790" offset="3990549">The record here reflects when the counsel asked the police officers said, “Are you aware of the statute requiring taken before magistrate?”</text>
            <text syncTime="978.593" offset="4017716">And he said, “Yes, sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="979.627" offset="4021896">And he said, “Why didn't you do it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="981.144" offset="4027956">And he said, “Well, it was 2:30 in the morning.”</text>
            <text syncTime="983.494" offset="4037360">The record is silent as to why he didn't do it the next day or the next day or the next day after that for 10 days when he still didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.986" offset="4067349">Now, this idea of the constitutional requirement of McNabb-Mallory is not as unique as it might sound the first blush.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.199" offset="4100159">This Court has so many instances in cases which were cited in our brief reversed state court convictions where the person was unlawfully held incommunicado without advice of counsel or friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.879" offset="4146866">That by analogy is also appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.055" offset="4155643">This man was actually held incommunicado for 10 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.639" offset="4169958">In fact, the case of Watts versus Indiana with Mr. Justice Marshall was recognized because it was one of his cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.071" offset="4195662">Although, this Court could not expressly apply the McNabb-Mallory Rule it came very close to it in reversing the state court conviction and one of the grounds cited was that a preliminary hearing under the --as replied by the law of Indiana had not been given and we respectfully submit that this should be a part of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.382" offset="4268910">Now, it would probably be urged that the application of the McNabb-Mallory Rule to state court proceedings is going to hamper effective law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.603" offset="4301824">That seems to be the present cry these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.901" offset="4311019">But I respectfully submit that nothing could be further from the truth as this Court knows the Federal Bureau of Investigation has had to live with the McNabb-Mallory Rule in Rule 5 (a) of the Federal Criminal Procedure Rules for over 15 years now and they still remain one of the most effective Law Enforcement Organization in this country if not in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.719" offset="4394297">Actually, with respect to the lineups, the language of this Court in the Wade case is singularly appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.264" offset="4428466">In that case, the court points out the vagaries of eyewitness identification here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.685" offset="4446124">There was one to two minutes as an opportunity to observe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.737" offset="4458350">The case points out the fact that criminal law history is right with the instances of mistaken identification and the difficulty with identifying a stranger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.404" offset="4497011">I think the part that is singularly applicable here is the part where this Court points out that it is a matter of common experience that once the person has made up his mind, nothing can change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.607" offset="4533791">If so that the identification takes place actually at pretrial rather in a in trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.883" offset="4554898">Actually, we respectfully submit that under the facts of this case, the McNabb-Mallory Rule should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.676" offset="4578095">But in fairness to and I think it fits and I think it's a necessary holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.413" offset="4593037">But in fairness to my client, I wish the urge at this point that if this Court in its wisdom does not think that the McNabb-Mallory Rule should be applied then I suggest that the totality of circumstance rule which this Court has supplied in other instances requires a reversal under the mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.341" offset="4668688">By that, I'm referring to the decision, I think its Cardozo and Mr. Justice Cardozo in the Palko case in the defense order of the liberty or if it violates the sense of justice or of the totality of circumstances indicate that there was not a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.435" offset="4725112">Certainly, the facts in this case the taking of a man from his home at night, 1:30 in the morning over a month after the crime was convicted -- it was committed, subjecting him to two lineups over 10-day period without the counsel, without the benefit of a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.067" offset="4799613">All these facts together constitute, in my judgment, a monstrous affront to the dignity of man and that this conviction should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2676.108" offset="10807777">We submit respectfully so that the petitioner was not prejudiced in any way in a manner or reform but is not being taken before a committing magistrate immediately after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.182" offset="10868067">One, because the probable cause necessarily for his arrest still existed and he could have been charged and rearrested by the state prosecuting officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.107" offset="10931806">And number two, a prosecution could have been forthcoming based on that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.226" offset="10960227">And number three, his conviction and this perhaps is the most important aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.230" offset="10980289">His conviction was not based on the lineup identification solely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.441" offset="11001187">His conviction was based on the in-court identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.951" offset="11019160">Independent of any lineup identification that was subsequently made after his arrest and that is clear from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.254" offset="11052387">So therefore, if his prosecution was not dependent upon the lineup, and his conviction was not dependent on the lineup, how can we say that the petitioner was prejudiced by not being brought before a committing magistrate?</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.846" offset="11122709">There is just now casual connection between prosecution or the conviction and is not being brought before a committing magistrate in the opinion of the respondent on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.002" offset="11179342">Therefore, we respectfully submit that the McNabb-Mallory Rule to be extended to the states under this factual circumstance and situation would be a double extension and not necessarily call for by factual situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.704" offset="11262203">Further, we respectfully submit that the petitioner's conviction was not in any way based upon his not being brought before committing magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.092" offset="11307760">We respectfully ask this Court to affirm the decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Florida in this cause.</text>
