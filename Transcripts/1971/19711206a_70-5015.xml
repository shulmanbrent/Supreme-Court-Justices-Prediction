            <text syncTime="1606.400" offset="6499667">Now, as a matter of fact, there are many times in the rural counties, where they do not have county compounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.929" offset="6529760">They often by arrangement have them serve in one City that may exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.582" offset="6548359">For instance, in place like Liberty County, which has only 2800 people in it, they do not have a compound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.858" offset="6581483">They interchange their facility, but if we are going to deal with the labels, I want t straighten that much out first, but we intend to throw labels out the window, because they really do not mean anything at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.897" offset="6621607">You said so in Goff and that is a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.036" offset="6634145">Under the Criminal Justice Act, it is broken by Congress that six-month on the petty offense doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.531" offset="6660163">Now, after the decision in Gideon and I think Mr. Justice Stewart after several times when you suggested that perhaps the matter of misdemeanor ought to be treated and had not been, the Supreme Court of Florida decided in Fisher versus State that if you had meant the Gideon should apply across the board as to crimes which includes both misdemeanors and felonies that you would assess them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.711" offset="6768833">And therefore, they held that the counsel was not an organic right in misdemeanor situations, no matter what.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.191" offset="6798821">Now, on another occasion before you, I advice you that indeed there were some misdemeanors in Florida, though there have been no prosecutions under it and that carry the maximum penalty, would you believe of 8 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.034" offset="6850126">And, in which case I think by an inquiry from Mr. Justice Brennan, I replied that if you had a situation like that, it would be absurd to suggest that you do not appoint counsel for him, because of the terms of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.337" offset="6899340">Now, as of January 1, 1972, all that will be wiped out by the passage of 71-136, which is a General Reviser’s Bill and that is found in the Florida session law service, it is post binder, covered in pages 381 to 711 or some 380 odd pages of a general revision of the criminal code of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.367" offset="7027445">They breakdown felonies into four degrees; capital and three degrees of felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.027" offset="7050119">They break misdemeanors down to two degrees and misdemeanors are broken down very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.476" offset="7083869">In terms of time and or money fines, for a misdemeanor of the first degree, by a definite term of imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.812" offset="7133293">We understand that under the decisions of the Fifth Circuit, in Harvey in the others and indeed under Judge Mert's decision in Princeton (ph), where he breaks it in six months, based upon the Criminal Justice Act and expecting a similar treatment as to federal and state prisoners that certainly everybody in Florida, as of January 1, who is under a misdemeanor of the first degree, is going to get in counseled, as a matter of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.980" offset="7253979">Now, for a misdemeanor of a second degree, by a definite term of imprisonment in the county jail, not exceeding 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.894" offset="7293580">Now, there is also a fine provision, which sets the fine at $500, but obviously after you reach the decision that you did not take, that is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.098" offset="7334436">Since, if he is indigent and cannot pay the fine, he cannot be made to serve more than 60 days, no matter how you could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.296" offset="7363171">So, we are now in the posture of going down 30 days below what the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has said was very acceptable petty offense line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.164" offset="7418655">If it was all misdemeanors before, if it was reduced to 6 months by the Criminal Justice Act and by the State of Florida Supreme Court in Argersinger and even if the Federal District Court in Jacksonville under Willie (ph), and by the way the only reason they are not advising everybody as to everything, is they are awaiting the outcome of your decision here in this case today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.358" offset="7515412">Now, we say that breaking point with the Fifth Circuit was set at 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.859" offset="7537460">We set it ourselves by the Florida Supreme Court relying on Judge Mert's decision in Princeton at six months which coincides with what you said, in Baldwin as to juries and with the Criminal Justice Act as to petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.611" offset="7604438">Now, the question becomes, is it awesome to the man who faces some kind of imprisonment no matter what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.036" offset="7626171">Well, somewhere you must break the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.677" offset="7636725">There was no command at the time that Argersinger was argued there, except that is urged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.578" offset="7660340">Now, I do not know how far we can break it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.288" offset="7671207">All I do know is as of January 1, they are only going to be a handful of people who are ever processed on misdemeanor charges who would not based upon the imprisonment possible be provided counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1936.073" offset="7818328">They may adopt whatever they like either by individual or charter provisions or they may adopt the violations of the state law as City Ordinances, but they must set independent punishment and in other words, the Reviser’s Bill does not reach them any degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.550" offset="7880186">I tell you, as a matter of pure fact, although it is not in the record here, that no City has violations to my knowledge, that had ever come to my attention that exceed 90 days for a violation of what would be of criminal law had it been processed in the state or by the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.681" offset="7944761">So, in the last analysis, we are told that you allow people to come into Court with the lawyer in situations of their own hiring, so why should you not do it here, no matter what the penalty is, and if you would do and if we use this, the statistics that they given us on the New York report of the million one -- million 800 thousand with only 40 processed to the degree where they were put in confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.219" offset="8054893">If anything ever sounded like de minimis to me, that certainly does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.611" offset="8072447">Now, if it is the awesome prospect that they tell us that it is, how come so few ever wound up in jail as a result of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.065" offset="8102227">Now, I think Mr. Justice Marshall’s question about what do you do when somebody winds up on the short end of a theretofore vacant threat?</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.455" offset="8143814">Well obviously, the answer as you pose Mr. Justice Stewart is if you wind up with a situation like that, that is easily correctable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.514" offset="8176101">We grant them a new trial, if what happened to him, so far outstrip what anybody expected certainly they are going to grant him a new trial, there is not any question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.672" offset="8216748">Now, I do not know how often that is going to occur if it all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.841" offset="8405352">Now, what that will do statistically to the problem posed, as suggested by petitioners, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.628" offset="8436490">But if we do away with victimless crimes, we are going to do away for the most part with what was the object of your concern in Tate and other cases, similar to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.564" offset="8480271">I submit that it is not anywhere near the problem suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.116" offset="8498452">I submit that the congress did not think that it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.232" offset="8510991">I submit that not even the Fifth Circuit thinks that it should be extended below the 90-day breaking line that they adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.965" offset="8545891">But even if it is, Florida has broken in at 60 days, as of January 1, 1972 and for all the world, nothing I have heard here today, gives me any reason to suspect that what was done with regard in Mr. Argersinger in the Florida Supreme Court should in be modified by any decision that you render here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.623" offset="8632513">I know that somebody says by one day, he lost the benefit of counsel, but wherever you would draw the line, assuming it is not all the way down to the basement, somebody is going to lose by one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.741" offset="8677025">Presumably, if you set the limit at 58 days, surely an artful legislature would say, well, let us make it 57, and it would be a never ending battle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.314" offset="8711298">So, I do not know that one day makes the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.797" offset="8721225">I know that the doctrine of petty offense has to mean something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.676" offset="8736689">Certainly, the Congress was not stupid when they adopted it nor was the Fifth Circuit stupid when they said that we think 90 days, is a good place at which to break it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.540" offset="8776186">I think Judge Mert's was aptly justified in breaking it at the six months suggested by the Criminal Justice Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.462" offset="8807847">Since, it does coincide and since that is what the Florida Supreme Court relied on and there is really no predicate for deciding that there ought to be a departure below the six-month petty offense rule and in the last analysis since Florida is not going to be imposing these awesome burdens at any time after January 1, I think the action of the Supreme Court of Florida should be affirmative in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.954" offset="9397796">I find it very difficult to understand how we convict anything less than one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.916" offset="9425695">How can we arbitrarily say that 1 day, 30 days or 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.898" offset="9449623">To the man that sitting in jail, that decision is completely arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.298" offset="9471252">I also would offer that there is no logical reason for picking 60 days or 90 days or six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.810" offset="9513257">As to some of the points that Mr. Georgieff raised, I believe there is now a Florida statute that was recently passed in our last session that makes county ordinances is the same as misdemeanors and that is a session law of 70-453, sub-section something or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.672" offset="9592669">I also want to try to make it clear that our position is that, we do not feel that it is necessary to make the counsel appointment that will not result to the counsel appointed in all of misdemeanor cases, only those where each practical possibilities that the person may receive some incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.510" offset="9684098">I think that the position of the Fifth Circuit was a bit misleading, as far as the state was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.957" offset="9713878">They said that the Fifth Circuit has a 90 days rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.622" offset="9724536">I do not think that is quite the case.</text>
