            <label>Mr. Michael F. Lefkow</label>
            <text syncTime="56.564" offset="299948">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.383" offset="315204">The State of Illinois makes payments under its federally subsidized program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, to needy dependent children between the ages of 18 to 21 years old, attending a vocational or technical training school, but denies payments to children attending a junior college, a college or a university.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.968" offset="405588">The issue in this case, is whether the discrimination is inconsistent with the requirements and the purposes of the Social Security Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.759" offset="468699">Mrs. Georgia Townsend and her daughter Omega were a family within the meaning of the Act and Omega was a dependent child, but they were cut-off and denied any aid under the AFDC program while they met all the requirements, specified by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.150" offset="546231">Appellant's rely on this Court's decision in King versus Smith which invalidated Alabama scheme of absolute disqualification of eligible children on the fiction that they had a substitute father.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.591" offset="600043">There, Alabama defined parent in a manner inconsistent with the Act and with its purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.483" offset="631599">Illinois likewise, has defined dependent children in a manner inconsistent with the Act and its purposes, by totally excluding from AFDC benefits, children attending a college or university.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.497" offset="687710">We believe that King clearly prohibits the Illinois' absolute disqualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.300" offset="710907">A reading of King requires an interpretation of the definitional section for Section 406 (a) that it is mandatory upon the State of Illinois to provide some aid to all those defined by Congress as dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.882" offset="773183">This requirement on the States was affirmed by this Court in Dandridge versus Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.449" offset="799514">That in order to avoid violating the statute itself, a state must provide some aid to all eligible families and all eligible children.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.763" offset="836712">Now, we submit that in addition to these two cases, there are a number of other important reasons why this statute is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.877" offset="873179">One is the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.265" offset="882688">Another, is necessary to make a mandatory to avoid frustrating the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.947" offset="905467">It is necessary for harmonious construction of the Federal Statutory Scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.122" offset="926156">It is necessary because of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.021" offset="941725">It is necessary to avoid an Equal Protection violation and it is necessary to prevent Illinois from withdrawing from this part of the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.858" offset="985088">I will return to the plain meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.667" offset="996373">The state has asserted that it had discretion whether it wants to adopt the definitional Section of 406 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="239.621" offset="1032108">We submit that there is -- the plain wording of the statute grants the state no discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.938" offset="1053424">A similar section, Section 407, would on its face grant the state discretion to participate in the unemployed or underemployed program which was added to the Act in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.925" offset="1125418">And this Court has stated in King versus Smith that that particular Section 407 is optional with the state, but there is nothing on the face of the statute in 406 (a) to indicate that the state has discretion to pick and choose among the children made eligible by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.337" offset="1182992">We submit that the legal standard for testing a state’s compliance is the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.790" offset="1208801">Next, it is necessary to make it mandatory to avoid frustrating the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.722" offset="1232520">The purpose of the Act is interpreted by this Court in King, is for the protection of dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.768" offset="1256761">That is the paramount goal and Congress in 1964, in amending the Social Security Act, stated that the assumption that children are no longer dependent, is not valid as applied to children still attending school.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.366" offset="1323112">Further, by denying these children --</text>

            <text syncTime="334.213" offset="1410570">Why did -- but it is if you are dealing up to 21, is that it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael F. Lefkow</label>
            <text syncTime="339.413" offset="1431364">In terms of the Equal Protection, it is if you distinguish between children attending a vocational or technical school and those attending a college or university up to the age 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.817" offset="1468980">In determining violation of the Equal Protection, you have to take into consideration the purposes of the Act and the purpose of this Act is to provide AFDC sustenance benefits up to age 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.865" offset="1517150">So measured in terms of purpose of the Act, a denial to college and university students would be a denial of Equal Protection because we submit that there is simply no rational basis for what the state has done by saying that if much it says over the door of the school to technical or vocational school, we are not going to grant these children aid in spite of the fact, that much technical or vocational education is provided in junior colleges, colleges and universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.497" offset="1619655">In fact, the State of Illinois and the Federal Government fund junior colleges in Illinois to the tune of $ 6.5 million a year to provide technical or vocational education and these children are excluded from participating in that because they do not have the money to have the food and the clothing and the shelter they need, so they can attend these schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.788" offset="1708784">We would further point out --</text>

            <text syncTime="410.130" offset="1714218">Mr. Lefkow, is it your position that the difference in receiving the aid under AFDC and not receiving it makes the difference between going to school or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="424.048" offset="1769911">Yes, Your Honor that would be our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.425" offset="1783390">Because all AFDC does, Your Honor, is provide, bring a person up to a minimal living level so that they have enough money to subsist on for food, for clothing and for shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.271" offset="1826753">It does not provide any additional benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.295" offset="1842845">Although I will point out that in this case, the child that has been in a technical or vocational school, the State of Illinois will pay a substantial tuition to these private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.193" offset="1882446">But, and this education, same education is available in a junior college.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael F. Lefkow</label>
            <text syncTime="485.219" offset="2014521">Yes, Your Honor that is what AFDC eligibility is.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.652" offset="2024239">It provides money for sustenance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.317" offset="2030926">We pointed out in our brief that she and her mother had been forced to live at an intolerable level of existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.057" offset="2057885">Her mother is a very sick woman, suffering from systemic erythematosus.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.801" offset="2076902">They live on about 15 cents a meal.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.910" offset="2085366">They have no -- hardly any furniture in their house.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.325" offset="2094979">They are suffering terribly and no child should have to go through that in order to obtain an education and that is what Congress meant by making sure that the sustenance benefits would be available for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.102" offset="2146074">And I would further like to point out that what Illinois has done is pause on this allocation of Federal Resources, Congress has determined that Federal funds should not flow to these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.130" offset="2198215">But Illinois has prohibited that and has unduly limited the welfare rules in Illinois by approximately a thousand children a year, who may want take advantage of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.506" offset="2239697">I further like to point out that the legislative history of the Act shows that Congress has continually expanded eligibility to meet rising educational requirements and opportunity as they become available in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.295" offset="2286822">In 1935, the child had to be under age of 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.973" offset="2301555">In 1939, Congress amended it to under 16 or under age 18, if the state determines the child is in school.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.196" offset="2330499">In 1956, Congress lifted the school age requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.760" offset="2344709">In 1964, they reinforced the school age requirement and in 1965, they added the college and university so that the child could be attending in effect any school.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.127" offset="2386192">As long as he is attending any type of school in pursuit of an education between 18 and 21, he would be eligible for these benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.635" offset="2416180">We would further like to point out that it is necessary for this Court to hold that this Section 406 (a) is mandatory because the section itself says, when used in this part, part (a) which is Title IV of the Social Security Act, these definitions are used throughout the whole Title of the Act and Section 402 (a) (10) which requires the aid to be furnished with reasonable promptness combined with Section 406 (a) clearly mandates this child should receive some aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.265" offset="2554734">In King versus Smith, the Court said in combination of these two sections clearly require that some aid be furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.288" offset="2582841">In Dandridge versus Williams, this Court held that a state may allocate among those who are already on the rolls, but it must provide some aid to all eligible families and all eligible individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.574" offset="2639997">I think it is clear from the Court’s opinion, Dandridge, both the majority and the dissent that the one thing everybody has agreed on, is that Congress fixes the federal eligibility requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.729" offset="2676569">That it was Congress to determine who is dependent and the states are allowed to determine who is needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.097" offset="2698094">The states have ample opportunity to protect themselves from adverse fiscal impact under this Court’s decision in Rosado, allowing percentage reductions and in Dandridge allowing the imposition of maximum grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.465" offset="2751488">So there is no -- the State of Illinois need to suffer no harm by a reversal of this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.610" offset="2784089">In an effect, as I pointed out in my reply brief, the fiscal effect on the State of Illinois would be minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.367" offset="2815122">It would be approximately $500,000.00 a year and the Federal Government would point, put up the $500,000.00 a year making a total of approximately $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.463" offset="2863501">We would also like to point out to the Court that the state’s purpose of encouraging employability which the state and the Court below has a whole purpose of the state statute denying assistance to college and university children, was to encourage employability.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.132" offset="2934241">But we will submit that rationale under this Court’s decision in Shapiro is not permissible or not logical.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.667" offset="2960363">In Shapiro, the court said that, encouraging employability was no justification for imposing one year residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.057" offset="2997875">That if you are going to impose that type of requirement, you would have to impose that not just on the ones who moved to new residence, moving into the state, but all the residence and we submit the same type of logic applies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.561" offset="3043955">That if you are going to require a child to go to work just because he is in college and university, it is only fair then for technical or vocational schools, that same standard to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.737" offset="3088572">However, I want to point out that HEW has clearly prohibited working requirements while the children are attending school between the ages of 18 and 21.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.836" offset="3793042">In those instances where children did not attend college, however, I am including here the junior colleges, public community colleges, because both of the named appellants here did attend public community colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.956" offset="3849467">These colleges are the only free schools that I know of in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.614" offset="3868170">The vocational institutes, the technical institutes that are included in the appendix to the appellee’s brief, are all tuition paying Institutions with the tuition payments of up to $3,800.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.947" offset="3929506">I should emphasize here, that we do not suggest or intimate that there is a requirement to pay tuition.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.346" offset="3963047">Though in fact, Illinois does under some circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.772" offset="3980810">In this case, the children involved, the appellants, the named appellants were attending free schools supported by state and federal moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.928" offset="4033369">All that is involved here is their basic subsistence grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.166" offset="4054371">I say all that is involved here, but obviously that grant covers their food, which they need to eat, shelter and clothing, the real essentials of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.433" offset="4095436">It should not be against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.285" offset="4110796">We differ slightly with the position of the other appellants in this case on the statutorily argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.222" offset="4142561">It is not our position that the definition is mandatory in every instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.461" offset="4171504">We recognize that Congress has in certain instances, indicated very clearly and unmistakably, at least in my judgment, that the program was intended to be optional and the states were to have a choice of either going into it or not going into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.247" offset="4242662">An example of this is involved in this case, and that is the extension of the 18 to 21-year-old group, was in my judgment clearly optional that the senate report stated under existing law, states at their option may continue payments to needy children up to age 21 in the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.747" offset="4344644">Then it goes on, however, providing they are regularly attending a high school in pursuance of a course of study, leading to a high school diploma or its equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.105" offset="4382051">The committee added an amendment extending this provision, referring to the Educational requirement provision, so as to include needy children under 21 who are regularly attending a school, college or university.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.760" offset="4444745">In other words, the program which is optional is the extension of AFDC to the age 18 to 21-year-old group, but the educational requirement provision is different and that was instituted according to the report which was deleted from the references by the Solicitor General and the appellees in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.772" offset="4540771">It is included in our original brief in our reply brief on page 9 that the educational requirement provision and the extension of college students was to bring the educational requirements more nearly in line with the provision of the bill relating to the continuation of a child's benefits under the OASDI System which is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.777" offset="4632827">Then it goes on; the objective of the provision, that is the educational requirement provision and the amendment to include colleges is to assure as far as possible that children will not be prevented from going to school or college because they are deprived of parental support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.325" offset="4714956">In the Solicitor General’s brief, the Solicitor General states, that the department referring to the Department of Health Education and Welfare, believes that the omission of college children from AFDC may have the unfortunate effect of perpetuating poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.142" offset="4794264">That in viewing the statute, one must be view it, in terms of its purposes and in terms of its structure and we submit that under both standards, it requires reading this provision as being mandatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.356" offset="4899067">No, it is not, but the reason why I mentioned and it is included in the committee report and these provisions were done in tandem, that Congress evinced a clear purpose to make the provisions as nearly alike as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.643" offset="4960298">That the college requirement’s provision was added to AFDC because it was done in OASDI and they wanted to make the two as nearly as like as possible and that is the only reason why I mention that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1280.772" offset="5196758">I think, it is very, very important to recognize here, the educational structure in Illinois as such that vocational training and one of the chief weapons used in order to obtain vocational training for people are public community colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.594" offset="5284007">We have submitted as an appendix to our brief, the college catalog for these junior colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.098" offset="5314100">There are courses such as air conditioning, inhalation therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.588" offset="5336043">These children are being denied the right to attend these courses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.110" offset="5362166">The entire role of vocational education in a state is being moved into this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.546" offset="5399886">In terms of the question earlier, if Congress had decided to cut it off at age 16, there clearly is no Equal Protection violation involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.056" offset="5441891">If they had cut it off at age 18, there would not (Inaudible), but Congress has not done that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.364" offset="5475119">Congress has identified a group of people whom it considered needy and in need of federal protection, it defined them and call them dependent children, and provided financial aid to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.968" offset="6085548">This is particularly true in this case, where you have a total exclusion of some children from a federally defined class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.575" offset="6124001">We do not have a kind of case as in Dandridge where everyone received some benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.742" offset="6156601">And the Court went out of its way to point that out, it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.509" offset="6171752">Whereas here, we do have this total exclusion; there is no doubt that the state has a justifiable interest in protecting its fiscal integrity and in conserving its AFDC resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.584" offset="6227968">We do not challenge that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.969" offset="6237581">What we do challenge is whether they have chosen the appropriate vehicle for so doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.252" offset="6262659">That is whether they can do this by excluding children from the class or whether they must provide at least some benefits to everyone and simply reduce if they must, the level of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.650" offset="6332249">The Department of Health Education and Welfare has taken -- argues that King does not require that the definition of dependent children be read as a Federal definition requiring the states to participate wholly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.272" offset="6414796">They argue that the term parent in King was is some way essential to the purposes of the Act and that there was a clear congressional intent to include all those children with an absent parent and the state could not define parents in a way contrary to the Social Security Act which in its legislative history meant legally obligated to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.774" offset="6552722">And in Lewis against Martin, there was a man assuming the role of a spouse who was actually living in the house, there was none of the fiction involved in King of a casual sexual liaison or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.509" offset="6607684">Here, we actually have a man in the house, living their and assumed the role of a spouse, but the Court said that children where a man lives there cannot be totally excluded from this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.741" offset="6660660">It seems to me that that requires this Court to say, that the definition was mandatory, that it has been held to be mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.957" offset="6689499">In Dandridge, the Court suggested that the definition was fixed by Federal Law and if it is fixed by Federal Law, then the state can have absolutely no right whatsoever to exclude some of those needy children from the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.352" offset="6783122">The Doctrine of Equitable Treatment which is advanced by the Department of Health Education and Welfare to explain King creates a total anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.799" offset="6832859">They have devised a doctrine without standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.425" offset="6847384">The cases which they have taken positions on cannot be squared in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.259" offset="6878730">King was required, Lewis was required in Arizona where otherwise eligible children living with relatives not having legal custody over the child and where the child had a sibling living with his natural parents were excluded from the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.930" offset="6949366">In these cases, the Department of Health Education Welfare concedes that the states went to stray and they have violated the federal definition and improperly excluded needy children from that definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.775" offset="7012791">But in the educational requirement which the senate report indicates clearly in my judgment, was intended to provide benefits to college children, to make sure that needy children, deprived of a parent were not denied the right to an education in college, at least where the state goes into the 18 to 21-year-old program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.572" offset="7115922">And it emphasizes that by saying as far as possible that those children can be excluded, that in Carter against Stanton which will be heard next by this Court, they interpret continued absence of being optional with the states and that where the parents have deserted or have been separated from the house for less than six months, the state is free to exclude needy children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.426" offset="7219367">There is no standard here we would submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.394" offset="7239220">In sum, that when one takes a look at the purposes of this Act, and when one takes a look at the classification that is involved here whether one looks at it in terms of the definition of dependent children under the Supremacy Clause or that when one looks at the difference between vocational training which is post-secondary and college training which is post-secondary, all of which end at the age of 21, neither of which involved tuition payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.138" offset="7366280">We can see no rational difference whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.562" offset="7379968">What we do find is we find a concerted effort to keep certain poor people from attending free public and publicly supported institutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.256" offset="8482649">I think it is somewhat important to know that Illinois' involvement in this case is not because that it has cut grants, as a matter of fact, Illinois provides a 100% of need or not because that it has established any strange eligibility requirements, but simply because it adopted a classification which was originally established by Congress in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.311" offset="8602917">Now, prior to 1964, the federal definition of a dependent child was a child under 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.765" offset="8640742">Then in 1964, Congress amended the definition and it defined a dependent child as someone under the age of 18 or someone under the age of 21 who is attending a high school which would lead -- a high school course of study which would lead to the diploma or vocational training school which would lead to gainful employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.554" offset="8747844">At the time that Congress amended its definition of a dependent child, Illinois similarly amended its Public Aid Code to provide essentially the same definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.200" offset="8798521">And in 1965, one year later, Congress again expanded the definition but unfortunately, the financial conditions in State of Illinois and the nine others states have not allowed it to expand the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.154" offset="8858290">Although Congress has consistently, since 1940, recognized that the state does not have to expand its benefits every time that Congress expands its definition of a dependent child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.692" offset="8912415">For example, in 1940, the age limit was 16 and Congress raised the age limit of a dependent child from 16 to 18, and at that time the House Report stated, it is estimated that about a 100,000 additional children may obtain the aid by virtue of this change provided all states amend their laws accordingly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.179" offset="11218401">I understand that as a practical matter if the child is in a technical or vocational school and he is expected to pay tuition for example, which may be $850 or $900, as a practical matter, he is in approximately the same position as somebody who is attending a college, who is getting a grant to cover expenses at a college, but is not getting the living expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.443" offset="11323413">We have provided -- State of Illinois has provided aid in two different areas, but essentially, they have equalized the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.070" offset="11361970">The point that I am attempting to make is that if the State of Illinois had a $100 to give and it had a choice between an 8-year-old child and a 20-year-old child, now both of them could fall within the technical definition of what is a needy child in the sense that they are making less than the standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.020" offset="11453712">But the fact remains that if we assume that Illinois has $100 and it chooses to give it to the 8-year-old, I do not think it could be said to be arbitrary that it chose to give that $100.00 to the 8-year-old as opposed to 20-year-old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.058" offset="11505957">The point being that even among those who are technically classified as needy, there are some who are more in the need of help than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.033" offset="11541797">The point is that here, those who are in technical or vocational school, although, they are technically as needy as somebody who is in a college or university, those children are still less in need of number one because it is more likely than not the kid in the technical or vocational school does not have a high school degree which means that he has no choice, he cannot get into a college or university.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.890" offset="11657258">He can only get into a technical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.641" offset="11668229">Secondly, he is not in as much need because of the fact that when he gets that high school degree, when he gets into a college or university, he is then available for this tuition which of course, would not apply in the case of a junior college and the grants in the guaranteed loans and especially the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.711" offset="11752552">So as a matter of fact, the child who is in a technical or vocational school, educationally under most state is at a distinct disadvantage because of the fact that he cannot get the same assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.946" offset="11801454">And again the point is, that a child, their high school degree does mark the difference between a child who is more in need of help than the other child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.164" offset="11846384">And again, I would like to get back to the fact that in 1965, now when Congress established and expanded the definition, at that time, it pointed out and this is contained on pages 36 and 37 of our brief that under existing laws, states at their option may continue payments and then the Senatorial Committee Report went on to say federal sharing for this purpose would thus be available to states who implement such a program, for payments to children regularly attending a college or university as well as those attending high school or vocational school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.481" offset="12023599">But Congress has made it clear that the states can as finances allow develop the program as long as there is a rational choice and again, I believe that there is a rational choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.278" offset="12094757">Counsel was candid enough to admit that we are talking about not only post-education, post-high school education but also the equivalent and for time that Congress originally established this classification, if you examine the classification as they set up, they spoke in terms of someone who is attending a high school and the course of study which would lead to a degree or vocational or technical school which would lead the gainful employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.221" offset="12238535">I think the point is that Congress at this time realized the fact that not everyone that the state was concerned with that not everyone that Congress was concerned about was somebody who would want to go back in high school and get a degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.903" offset="12305304">I think it was concerned about the kid who drops out of high school and finds that he has no aptitude for it and desires instead to go to a vocational or technical school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.946" offset="12349503">But I think that we are not talking about the same class of kids.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.366" offset="12367161">I think that the principles of this Court has enunciated on a number of occasions that the state can attack as much of a problem as its finances allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.909" offset="12405300">Now, no discussion would be complete without a picture of the situation in Illinois that exists now because of a substantial increase, applied full increase in the AFDC cases, Governor Ogilvie announced that there is a $108 million overall deficit in the welfare programs and specifically $107 million deficit in state funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.451" offset="12519508">Now, the Governor was faced with either cutting grants and in the report which he submit in October 1971, he spoke in terms of one-third cut in the standard of need as opposed to a 100%, giving a 100% standard of need they would mean roughly 67 or 70% standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.604" offset="12612086">In an attempt to alleviate this problem, what he did was he transferred funds from the General Assistance Funds, General Assistance Fund which is truly a state program into AFDC, he transferred $21 million and this is then met the AFDC budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.340" offset="12691080">Now, litigation resulted and as of this time, the governor has been enjoined from carrying out this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.176" offset="12722427">But the point is that at this time, there is a possibility of cutting the standard of need in AFDC cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.889" offset="12765268">We do not believe that the constitution requires the State of Illinois to take the money, assuming that this is the condition, we do not believe that the constitution requires the State of Illinois to take money from the 8-year-old and the 9-year-old and the 10-year-old and give it to a 20-year-old basketball player.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.974" offset="12841545">We believe that we have helped those who are most in need under Illinois law, namely those without the high school degree, those who say in a period of a short time could become employable within one employable report, we believe that the State of Illinois has acted rationally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.538" offset="12931824">We believe that Congress has realized every time that it has expanded the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.166" offset="12954290">From 1940 on they have expressed the opinion that the states were free to either adopt the amendments to expand the programs or not to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3373.790" offset="13568794">Omega Minor will finish in about five-and-a-half years and the other plaintiff indicated that he intended to go on for a period of four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.095" offset="13618009">So again, the point is here that in a technical or vocational school, not only is it more likely than not that you have someone who does not have a high school degree, and therefore, is more in need of help but you also have a situation where the state can provide AFDC benefits for a period of perhaps four months to a year and be assured that at the end of that time that there is some chance that the recipient will no longer need the help of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.961" offset="13765548">But going at to the point again, Congress has said every time that has amended the Act, the states are free to either expand the definition or not expand the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.948" offset="13809434">HEW has defined or has made similar statements, they have set forth their views in the regulation which is cited in our brief and in that regulation, they have said that a state is free to -- they have said specifically in their brief on page 39 that although the public assistance titles to find the coverage in which the Federal Government will participate financially, a state may provide coverage on a broader or more limited basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.700" offset="13976513">And in later views expressed by HEW and by Congress, we believe that the plaintiffs are asking for relief which both Congress and HEW has thus far refused to grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.950" offset="14041506">For this Court to grant this extended coverage would be contrary to the principles that is enunciated on a number of occasions that in the statutory construction case, its function is not to implement its own views, but rather to carry out the will of Congress and Congress has manifested its will that the states are free to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.719" offset="14148504">Furthermore, I would point out that Congress can grant the relief which the plaintiffs are seeking, by passing the timely Assistance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.793" offset="14196882">Now, the difference between this Court granting the relief sought by the plaintiffs and Congress achieving the same result, that under the family assistance plan, if this is done, if aid is extended to those in colleges or universities as well as those in technical or vocational schools, under the Act as it stands now, the Federal Government would provide additional funds other than what it now provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.140" offset="14322270">Of course, it now provides funds on a 50-50 basis under a portion of that the Family Assistance Act, it would fund 100% as opposed to 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.249" offset="14366678">I believe that this is a realization by Congress that not all of the states can fully implement the Act and that if Congress wants the uniform system of welfare across the entire nation that it will have to provide additional benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.404" offset="14535325">In conclusion, I would like to say that this Court recognized in Dandridge that eroding employability and saving funds were legitimate state ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.531" offset="14591749">The appellee submits to the Court that the course of the action which they have taken is rationally related to each of these two ends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.215" offset="14634486">The state, we believe has made a reasonable choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.199" offset="14666459">We do not believe that the constitution requires the state to take money from the 8-year-old, the 9-year-old and the 10-year-old to take part of those benefits and share those benefits for the 20-year-old basketball player.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.289" offset="14734796">We believe that the other class is more needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.365" offset="14751096">The state has helped those and we believe that the state has acted constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.143" offset="14778264">For these reasons, we ask that the decision of the Court below be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.058" offset="14793937">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>
