            <text syncTime="40.721" offset="236523">This case is here on direct appeal from a judgment of three-judges District Court for the Southern District of Indiana which dismissed appellants complaint for failure of federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.694" offset="292425">The issues involved are jurisdiction of questions pertaining both to the jurisdiction of this Court to hear the appeal under Section 1253 of the judicial code and to the jurisdiction of the three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.167" offset="362329">The plaintiffs in this action were mothers of dependent children to at the time of filing their complaint in the District Court had been denied either the right to file an application for aid to families with dependent children or had been denied assistance under that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.281" offset="450832">Jurisdiction below was founded on Section 1343(3) and (4) of the United States code and the action was brought under Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.215" offset="510495">Plaintiffs brought the action on their own behalf and as a class action on behalf of other mothers similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.345" offset="547067">The Social Security Act defines a dependant child as a needy child who has been deprived of parental care or support by reason of the continued absence from the home of a parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.326" offset="618956">Plaintiffs alleged that they were entitled to assistance under this provision because their husbands and the fathers to their children had deserted the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.436" offset="675380">Plaintiffs also alleged in their complaint that aid under this provision was denied pursuant to Indiana regulation 2402(b) which is set forth at the bottom of page 5 of appellants brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.850" offset="733059">This regulations state when the continued absence is due to desertion or separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.800" offset="764928">The absence shall have been continuous for a period of at least six months prior to the date of application for assistance except that under exceptional circumstances of need and where it is determined that the absence of apparent is actual and bonafiding, an application maybe filed and a child maybe considered immediately eligible upon a special finding of the County Department of Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.213" offset="890525">A three-judge court was convened to hear the plaintiffs allegation that this regulation was not only unconstitutional, but was also contrary to provisions of the Social Security Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jon D. Noland</label>
            <text syncTime="230.120" offset="994179">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.247" offset="998672">Mothers who had been denied welfare benefits under this regulation because the husband had not been away from the home for a period of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.373" offset="1051126">Following the convening of the three-judge court, each of the two appellees, the County Department of Public Welfare and the State Department of Public Welfare filed motions to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.959" offset="1097519">These motions were based primarily on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.345" offset="1111103">One, a failure on the part of the plaintiffs to exhaust their state administrative remedies, and secondly the failure of the complaint to raise substantial constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.827" offset="1165019">The three-judge panel then convened a combine hearing both on the motions to dismiss and on the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.650" offset="1200232">Evidence was heard from approximately 16 witnesses and at that point the court adjourned the hearing and granted the motions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.185" offset="1238371">The court's entry appears at page 210 of the appendix and on page 212 of the entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.364" offset="1283093">The entry demonstrates that the decision of the court was based one upon the court's finding that each of the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their state administrative remedies, and secondly, the court held we have examined the pleadings before us and find no substantial federal question involved nor do we find federal jurisdiction under 28 US(c) Section 1343(3) and (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="331.014" offset="1397718">It is apparent to the appellants from this entry that the District Court resolved none of the conflicts in testimony which became evident during the course of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.504" offset="1439723">Rather, it made it so finding that the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust state administrative remedies and then on the basis of the pleadings and solely on the basis of the pleadings, it found that no substantial federal questions were presented for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.288" offset="1514851">Before turning to the correctness of the decision of the District Court, the appellee, the State Department of Public Welfare has raised a threshold question in this case pertaining to this Court's jurisdiction under Section 1253 of the judicial code.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.164" offset="1582352">As we understand the argument, the appellants and the appellee’s contention is that in failing to find substantial federal question, the three-judge panel in effect dissolved itself and that therefore the final entry should be construed as having been the decision of a single district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.672" offset="1664376">In support of that decision the appellee relies primarily upon two per curium decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.398" offset="1691230">Mengelkoch versus Wilson, Mengelkoch versus The Industrial Welfare Commission and Wilson versus City of Port Lavaca.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.128" offset="1726234">Without repeating all of the argument set forth in appellants reply brief, we believe that this case is significantly different from those decisions and that here there was no express finding by the three-judge panel that it had been improperly convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.103" offset="1790077">The final decision in fact was entered by all three-judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.398" offset="1807318">In addition, it is apparent from the entry that in large part, the decision of the District Court was based upon the failure to exhaust state administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.068" offset="1845979">And as we read this Courts decision in Idlewild Liquor Corporation against Epstein that is a consideration which could be properly made only by three-judge court and not by a single district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.042" offset="1897806">Furthermore the Court here convened the hearing on the merits as well upon the motion to dismiss and took extensive evidence from approximately 16 witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.127" offset="1934169">Again, we submit that this is a procedure which could be followed followed only by the three-judge court.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="471.307" offset="1958933">Could that not also mean that having heard 16 witnesses conceivably, it concluded that there was no problem for three-judge court?</text>
            <text syncTime="483.737" offset="2008670">I am not suggesting it was, but could that not also be an explanation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jon_d_noland" startTime="487.577" stopTime="594.720">
            <label>Mr. Jon D. Noland</label>
            <text syncTime="487.577" offset="2024030">It is certainly conceivable Mr. Chief Justice that the three-judge panel could have heard witnesses and decided on the basis of the testimony induce that the complaint failed to raise substantial constitutional questions and dissolve itself and then left the final judgment for single district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.029" offset="2097800">By not doing so, we believe the District Court here recognized in fact that it was not making a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.174" offset="2126326">Within the meaning of, for example Ex parte Poreski (ph) that the complaint failed to raise substantial constitutional questions, but made that decision on the basis of a finding of a failure to exhaust state administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.629" offset="2184213">We submit that what has happened here is the District Court has taken this Court's decision in King versus Smith and turned the formula around and said in this case substantial constitutional questions are not raised because there was a failure to exhaust state administrative remedies, and we submit that that is a determination which could made only by the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.121" offset="2278149">In support of appellants position on this point, we believe the recent decision of this Court on October 12 of this year in a case of Hicks versus Pleasure House, Inc. is instructive or in that decision, the Court characterized the Wilson decision and the Mengelkoch decision as holding that an appeal may lie to a Court of Appeals from certain action of a single district judge in a case required to be heard by three-judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.881" offset="2409179">And again here we have no action of a single district judge, but a final appealable judgment entered by the three-judge court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jon D. Noland</label>
            <text syncTime="653.883" offset="2689212">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.310" offset="2718887">Turning now to the precise nature of attacks on the regulation below.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.110" offset="2746159">Appellants have attacked the regulation at the bottom of page 5 of their brief, both on constitutional and statutory grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.816" offset="2784925">Two attacks were made on the basis of the regulation is unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.448" offset="2811465">The first attack relates to the requirement that where the separation has been for a period of less than six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.963" offset="2833512">Exceptional circumstances of need must be shown in order to secure a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.381" offset="2863188">We see no rational basis for saying that if the separation has been for less than six months, a child must be exceptionally needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.172" offset="2902371">While if the separation has been for more than six months mere need is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.016" offset="2925777">Therefore, we argue below that this particular provision of the regulation constituted a denial of equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.252" offset="2966632">We do not believe that this question is rendered in substantial or frivolous by the Court's decision in Dandridge against Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.266" offset="2998711">We have an entirely different factual situation, a different type regulation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.601" offset="3020131">A regulation under which the appellant and other applicants have been denied all aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.976" offset="3053568">We do not have here a maximum grant type regulation where the families are already receiving some type of assistance and a maximum level is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.247" offset="3098708">Secondly, the appellants have attacked the regulation on its face as granting a standard list and arbitrary discretion to the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.902" offset="3133294">As pointed out, in order to secure a waiver of the six months requirement, a special finding must be made by the County Department of Public Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.188" offset="3178433">Two of the plaintiffs in this case alleged in the complaint that no investigation had been made into their circumstances upon which such a special finding could be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.937" offset="3233395">On this basis, we believe the administrator has discretion as to whether to conduct an investigation in any particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.412" offset="3267354">The discretion which is not guided by any standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.212" offset="3282505">Furthermore, whether it is a failure to conduct an investigation, the regulation in effect enacts and concludes the presumption that an absence for less than six months cannot be a continuous absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.428" offset="3335377">In these particular cases therefore, we have a rigid six month waiting period and the same type of regulation or statute which was involved in the Damico case and in the Minnesota case of Bill versus Hersh (ph).</text>

            <text syncTime="912.173" offset="3722407">I think our primary problem with this regulation is relating the exceptional circumstances of need requirement to a durational requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.898" offset="3757307">We could see no rational basis for saying that even though it maybe difficult to arrive at a determination of continued absence that a waiver will be granted only if exceptional circumstances of need are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.438" offset="3807462">We believe that violates Social Security Act which speaks of needy children and not exceptionally needy children.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.181" offset="3842361">In addition, the appellants have alleged in their complaint that there is a statewide policy in practice under this regulation of requiring applicants to file for legal separation or divorce in order to secure a waiver of the six month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.845" offset="3901085">The testimony before the three-judge panel on this question was directly conflicting.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.113" offset="3922087">There was evidence on behalf of plaintiffs that such a practice had been engaged in, at least in their cases and in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.917" offset="3949359">The administrators on the other hand denied the existence of any such practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.446" offset="3971511">As we think as apparent from the Court's entry, the Court they know fact finding as to whether this practice did or did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.663" offset="4004321">Apparently, assume the existence of the practice and yet nevertheless found that the constitutional issue is raised for insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.498" offset="4035668">Appellants urge that such practice that exist as alleged constitutes denial of First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.264" offset="4102750">Turning now to the question of exhaustion of administrative remedies, we think this is the primary basis for the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.269" offset="4142770">As appellants have read, the prior decisions of this Court there is an absolute exemption from any exhaustion requirement or actions brought under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.681" offset="4180386">This is been established both by the Damico versus California and King versus Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.595" offset="4204105">We submit that there is important policy justification for such an exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.196" offset="4234407">Cases such as this under the Civil Rights Act and particularly welfare cases involve essentially or primarily questions of Federal Law whether the constitutional law or statutory law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.554" offset="4287906">We see no need therefore for the State Administrator to consider State Law to make any fact finding based on the record before an administrative agency or to apply their expertise or discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.237" offset="4346629">The regulation here is being attacked both on its face and does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.341" offset="4367005">We believe these issues can properly be determined by a Federal Court without exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.936" offset="4393441">In addition, if exhaustion is to be required in certain cases we submit that this is not such a case because the administrative remedy is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.587" offset="4436072">There is no identical administrative remedy in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.662" offset="4452373">That remedy is solely individual in nature, there is no class action procedure before the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.212" offset="4490512">In addition that an administrative appeal does not result in any decision of general applicability throughout the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.260" offset="4538681">Now the appellee's state department in this has devoted a large portion of its brief to arguing that full discovery rights are available in administrative proceedings in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.914" offset="4585284">The appellants do not dispute that proposition as a matter of statute but law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.883" offset="4605241">However, the very record in this case demonstrates that any pursuit of discovery before the administrative agency would be entirely feudal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.623" offset="4648187">The plaintiffs below filed both subpoenas and motions to produce to obtain copies of case files and other documents pertaining to the application of the challenge regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.269" offset="4698760">Both the State Department and the County Department resisted any motion to produce on the basis that the records requested were confidential in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.655" offset="4736272">And in a letter to the Court and to Council dated November 5, 1970 State Welfare Department stated, I specifically request that you obtain a court order to require Mr. Sterick (ph) to produce these files at the time of his proposed examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.215" offset="4814535">The County Welfare Department said essentially the same thing in an affidavit filed in support of their objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.022" offset="4841806">Now it is essential in case such as this that the plaintiffs have access to the documents in order to establish their constitutional allegations that this regulation has been applied in such a manner as to be contrary to the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.761" offset="4904709">Yet the appellees have told us in this very case that they will require a court order in order to produce the documents requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.081" offset="4945983">Appellants know of no procedure in Indiana whereby a Court order can be obtained without filing a law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.551" offset="4971896">Therefore we submit, we are back right where we started from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.032" offset="4985793">The appellants would receive none of the documents in an administrative proceeding and would be required to file the very law suit which now before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.644" offset="5036262">And additional basis for the decision of the District Court appears to have been a reliance upon Mr. Justice Stone's distinction made in Hague versus CIO that no jurisdiction lies under the Civil Rights Act where the complaint raises only questions relating to property rights and not to personal rights incapable of valuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.935" offset="5141379">We believe that the prior decisions of this Court have satisfied this question that jurisdiction does lie under the Section 1343(3) whether it is denial of welfare benefits, since it had been recognized that such a denial does involve important aspects of personal liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.686" offset="5220373">Therefore we urge that the District Court urge in dismissing the complaint on this ground.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark Peden</label>
            <text syncTime="1991.351" offset="8039090">We believe that the Indiana six month requirement is not violated of the equal protection because it is found it in rationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.483" offset="8075557">In the previous case, the court had difficulty distinguishing between the college student and a vocational student.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.274" offset="8122786">But there can be no doubt that under a six month requirement, the standard or the continued absence is going to be a lot more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.215" offset="8166567">The longer the parent is absent from the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.319" offset="8198959">The six month requirement is founded in the common sense belief that when a father leaves a family, it would be very likely that the standard of need, soon after the father leaves is not as grace it will be later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.652" offset="8292268">The regulation also contains a clause which states that in cases of exceptional circumstances aid maybe available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.675" offset="8344409">This clause means that when -- since standard, the evidence below indicate that the standard of need that recall for a family for aid after six months was the same as used by the Welfare Department in a determination of who met exceptional circumstances before six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.226" offset="8430613">The basis of the ruling is that when a man leaves the house, there will be some money or the family would be able to at least subsist for a length of time, and that it is necessary in order to prevent fraud in order to ensure that the continued absence is real.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.576" offset="8531968">Now, it is our position that this does not violate equal protection because under the Dandridge case, the court noted that the test of such a regulation is whether or not it is reasonable, whether or not it is brief in various discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.139" offset="8634264">The AFDC program was described as a program of cooperative federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.036" offset="8665819">The states have leeway and under the statutory argument, aside from the equal protection argument, it is our position that 406 as a definition is not mandatory in binding up on the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.688" offset="8732379">This is already brought out in the last case to quite an extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.358" offset="8751083">We feel that the requirements that are binding upon the state as suggested by the Solicitor General are in Section 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.785" offset="8796850">These requirements have been settled with effective dates whereby in order to meet these requirements, the states have to comply by a certain date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.301" offset="8870828">Whereas Section 406, the definitional Section are no effective dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.236" offset="8902593">This in busy just then that the real requirements of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.434" offset="8919416">The ones which would require the states to perhaps enact legislation that will enable them to meet the requirements that Section 402 is a Section which actually establishes binding requirements on the state and legislative history of this act fully supports this, all the remarks in the senate reports cited by the Solicitor General’s brief in this case, amply support the view that Section 406 establishes the outer boundaries of state participation for which federal funding will be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.335" offset="9067060">And that Section 402 is the only of section of the act which is mandatory upon the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.617" offset="9096108">Section 402(b) states that the secretary will approve any plan which complies with that section meaning 402 and the requirements in 402(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.935" offset="9157444">It does not say that the secretary will refuse to approve plans because a fail to commit the definitional requirements in Section 406.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.708" offset="9224526">So we submit that on the basis of standards case, there is no conflict with equal protection under the six month rule and then upon the basis of the legislative background and the internal consistency of the Social Security Act, there is no conflict with that act neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.492" offset="9311671">Thank you, the rest of time will be taken by my partner Mr. Geddes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2321.912" offset="9361304">Mr. Justice Douglas, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.018" offset="9377708">With the limited time, I would like to make it perfectly clear to the Court that the appellee Wayne Stanton, his position is that we should not be in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.667" offset="9424311">Not whether that we should be in this Court so much or whether or not we should be in the Federal Court if the doctrine of abstention or the doctrine of exhaustion administrative remedies had any meaning under this type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.966" offset="9489512">With respect to the merits of this case, it is fully covered in our briefs, it is fully covered with case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.670" offset="9524308">There were charges in there that the applicants or the claimants says we could not file an application unless we sued for divorce, unless we filed for legal separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.087" offset="9565999">The evidence is clear in fact two of the claimants alone received benefits less than three month after their husbands separated and they never filed for divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.522" offset="9611766">There was a witness Smith, she testified that she filed her application immediately and within a month she received aid, she never filed for divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.967" offset="9657532">There was a witness Blake LaClair (ph) she receive aid in two months after separation, never filed for divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.455" offset="9687521">So as far as this six month requirement under the Indiana Regulation, all the six month is a guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.144" offset="9718241">In other words, after six months is a conclusive presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.168" offset="9734332">But if the need is there and the absence is action bonafide, the regulation says that the person can receive aid immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.717" offset="9780517">That distinguishes this case from Damico and all of the others where was a three month situation sue start.</text>

            <text syncTime="3555.055" offset="14293849">Whatever that requirement means, it certainly must mean more than plain need.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.713" offset="14312552">And we object to it on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.575" offset="14335958">Furthermore, with respect to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, appellants would again urge that the administrative remedy in this case was not adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.203" offset="14378486">We heard talk again of discovery and yet the record in this very case shows that any discovery effort at the administrative level would be feudal because the State Department has already told us that we must obtain the court order in order to obtain the documents requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.939" offset="14453405">If it stated in Monroe versus Pape, and in the McNeese case, Section 1983 does truly constitute a remedy supplementary to any state remedy and we believe that that must be construed as granting an exemption from exhaustion either of administrative or of your state judicial remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.465" offset="14563537">In addition of course, there are important federal questions involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.243" offset="14582659">We are talking about essentially federal program under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.921" offset="14601362">We are talking about challenges to a state regulation that has been invalid on space and has applied, and we believe it is appropriate in the case of this nature for those decisions to be made for an impartial tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.948" offset="14649428">We see no need to exhaust state administrative remedies in such a case.</text>
