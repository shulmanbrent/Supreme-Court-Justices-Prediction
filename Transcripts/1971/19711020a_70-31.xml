            <text syncTime="32.216" offset="202570">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.205" offset="222527">This case is before the Court upon appeal from a Three-Judge Court of the District of Oregon, affirming a division of Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.639" offset="264219">Jurisdiction of this Court is conferred by 28 U.S.C. 1253.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.258" offset="290759">This case arose when two of the four railroads serving Portland filed an application with the Commission for authority to acquire control of Peninsula Terminal Company under Section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.184" offset="346452">The two acquiring railroads were Union Pacific and Spokane, Portland &amp; Seattle Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.928" offset="373411">The latter, SP&amp;S, at the time of the application was a subsidiary of Great Northern and Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.667" offset="404340">It is now a part of the Burlington Northern System under the approval granted by this Court in the Northern Lines merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.347" offset="431089">I shall hereafter refer to them as Burlington Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.049" offset="449897">In their application, the acquiring railroads stated that it was anticipated that within the foreseeable future substantial new traffic and revenues would be derived from Peninsula Terminal as a result of the development of the Rivergate Industrial track by the Port of Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.507" offset="519696">It is thus substantial new traffic and revenues which will be generated by Rivergate that is prompted the great interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.651" offset="556268">Rivergate is the key to the public interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.577" offset="571941">It is an area of approximately 3,000 acres located at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.836" offset="633068">That is a much more detailed map Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.759" offset="640696">If you would refer to the schematic which we have appended to the end of our brief, I think it will be simpler to follow than that complicated map, which you have before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.186" offset="682387">At the end of our brief there is a simple schematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.224" offset="694612">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.753" offset="704643">Rivergate is marked on this at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.405" offset="739334">It is owned and it is being developed by the Port of Portland for whom I am general counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.854" offset="761068">I am also appearing today for the Milwaukee and Southern Pacific as who are joint appellants and for the Oregon Public Utility Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.901" offset="801296">A great amount of time and money has been invested by the Port Authority in planning this modern, attractive, industrial and port complex to provide for the future economic development of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.345" offset="851034">Here is where all modes of transportation will meet to provide efficient and economical interchange of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.474" offset="883530">The port has already invested more than $5 million of public fund, and it estimates that will expend a minimum of $15 million in the full development of Rivergate.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.210" offset="930550">A conservative estimate in the record of the public and private investment in this area exceeds $500 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.406" offset="967331">With further evidence which is undisputed is that Rivergate at full development will require the handling of some 500-600 railroad cars per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.669" offset="1012366">In order to orient the Court with various railroads involved here, I would refer again to our schematic which is appended to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.094" offset="1054057">The Peninsula Terminal Company, the railroad in question here, is marked in yellow at the upper northern end, just south of the Columbia River.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.753" offset="1104735">The record shows it is a railroad of sum 3.79 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.706" offset="1124483">Its importance is not its size but its strategic location as a gateway to Rivergate.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.823" offset="1153009">To the south and west, there is another Rivergate entrance which is shown as number 9 on our schematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.221" offset="1194596">There is a small mark in the one corner of north.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.803" offset="1204941">North is at the top of the page, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.180" offset="1222390">Number 9 is Barnes Yard which is owned by the Union Pacific, that Burlington Northern has an agreement for use of that yard and access to Rivergate over the track shown in red.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.432" offset="1275367">Where the track enters Rivergate, as it is shown in blue, the track has been built and is owned by the Port.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.692" offset="1316431">The record also shows that the railroad pattern in Rivergate will essentially be a loop system around the periphery of the entire district, with one outlet through the south in Barnes Yard which now shows in red, and the other through the northern outlet which is where the Peninsula Terminal Company acquires its importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.095" offset="1410054">To achieve with Rivergate’s goal, it is necessary that --</text>

            <text syncTime="673.465" offset="2767585">Let us turn to the Milwaukee ownership which we discussed under the Northern Lines case.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.629" offset="2792245">We contend that by refusing Milwaukee a part ownership in the Peninsula Terminal, the Commission has turned its back on what it said in approving the Northern Lines merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.252" offset="2834668">Namely that competition loss between Great Northern and Northern Pacific would be substantially offset by a greatly enhanced competition from Milwaukee.</text>

            <text syncTime="712.249" offset="2922648">The entire purpose of Condition 24, as I read it in the Commission’s decision and in this Court’s decision, was to permit Milwaukee to become a line-haul competitive carrier with the new Burlington Northern replacing the Northern Pacific and Great Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.988" offset="2993597">This was going on at exactly the same time as the Commission was handling the Great Northern merger case.</text>

            <text syncTime="802.223" offset="3282616">Let me point out that down at point 9, which is Barnes Yard which is a Union Pacific facility, in May of 1967, Exhibit 39 which is in the Appendix at Page 303, a contract was entered into between Union Pacific and Burlington Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.259" offset="3366730">By virtue of that contract, Union Pacific permitted Burlington Northern to get into Rivergate through the south entrance through point 9, but in that they agreed that they would let no one else in unless they had the approval of the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.156" offset="3430260">So they have effectively foreclosed Milwaukee at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.837" offset="3444993">As a further provision in that agreement, they said if there was ever a new line which pulls off of the Burlington Northern main line and goes into Rivergate at the Northern end forgetting about Peninsula, if there is a new line that goes in there, that too will be subject to the same terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.150" offset="3514270">It will be only BN and UP and no one else can be admitted without their concurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.305" offset="3542900">That was -- the Peninsula contract was signed in February 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.555" offset="3563902">This agreement I have just referred to, Exhibit 39, was signed in May, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.855" offset="3589084">In July, 1967, they filed the petition for acquisition which is now before the Court and in November, 1967, Condition 24 was imposed in the Northern Lines -- by the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.143" offset="3642270">And certainly it is apparent to us that this was well in the mind of all of the parties at the time the transaction was being taken up with Peninsula Terminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1372.659" offset="5564359">I should also like to comment on the strange procedure that Burlington Northern and Union Pacific adopted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.950" offset="5601453">In their brief which is field to this Court, they made a settlement offer to Milwaukee which is in the extremely strange place in the proceeding to try to make the settlement offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.167" offset="5650354">We contend that it is a last minute recognition of the fact that the Commission was wrong, when it decided there would be no detriment to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.214" offset="5686508">This offer really does not give Milwaukee anything other than the saving of an unnecessary switch charge -- this goes to Mr. Justice White’s question -- to deliver cars to Peninsula and possibly a savings in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.997" offset="5741678">However, Burlington Northern and Union Pacific, under the offer they made, will still control Peninsula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.781" offset="5768846">They can control its development as well as the development of Rivergate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.165" offset="5786296">They have still been able to insert themselves between Milwaukee and Rivergate by this controlled company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.892" offset="5817225">We think that this recognition of -- their own recognition certainly demands that it be remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.272" offset="5850766">I spoke in a great deal about Milwaukee in this argument because they are in a slightly different factual situation because of the Northern Lines merger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.683" offset="5896428">But we feel the public interest equally require Southern Pacific to have access to this industrial area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.533" offset="5927775">Same benefits of single routing, improved terminal service, modern technology and rate benefits would apply if the Southern Pacific was equally there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.979" offset="5981587">The testimony in this case is that there is an upholding over 30-hour delay in delivering a Southern Pacific car from point 6 to point 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.493" offset="6031638">It takes them over 30 hours to traverse that 5.2 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.955" offset="6057551">Obviously that traffic is not being handled as expeditiously as it can even on this little small volume that the Peninsula Terminal carries now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.999" offset="6109692">How can they possibly handle 500-600 cars a day with delays like that?</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.063" offset="6193910">Peninsula is a very small terminal railroad, which runs a few hundred feet inland of the Columbia river more precisely the Oregon’s Loop in the Northern part of Portland and the distance from the one extremity and I personally prefer using the map in that Appendix 273 rather than just analyzing map in the brief of the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.878" offset="6321179">And the map at 273 indicates that Peninsula extends a distance of about a mile-and-a-half and from the Multnomah County fair grounds and on the East, and two a pole in debarking and storage facility of the Crown Zellerbach Corporation on the West.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.150" offset="6498289">There are some 13 industries that are served by the Peninsula in a way together and generate approximately 10 cars a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.610" offset="6544160">But the interest is not so much in the Peninsula as it is presently organized in industries it presently serves, but rather the interest stands from the adjacent North Rivergate industrial and District property and the expectation that it might be developed and that Rivergate -- and that the Peninsula might be a railroad access to a portion of that property so-called North Rivergate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.523" offset="6659726">Rivergate is an area of about four-and-a-half square miles situated at the confluence of the Willamette and the Columbia Rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.565" offset="6691909">And it is indeed and being developed as a Port and industrial facility and it is expected and that upon completion it will generate approximately five million tons of railroad traffic annually acquiring the use of 100 car trains totaling about 500-600 cars a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.651" offset="6796294">In their briefs the appellants fall the Commission for seemingly ignoring in the potential growth of Rivergate and its needs for railroad service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.447" offset="6835478">We respectfully submit that the Commission’s report recites the evidence, the summary of the evidence pertaining to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.417" offset="6867347">We submit that the appellants quarrel really is what the Commission is waiting of that evidence and matter clearly for the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.133" offset="6906217">Against that evidence and there -- it was evidence of record and that the Rivergate currently is a Marshland and it is subject to flooding periodically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.577" offset="6951984">Practically all of it remains to be filled graded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.090" offset="6970061">Practically all that remains to be supplied with utilities, roads, piers and docks, and the completion of the plans for Rivergate is on 15 or more years distant and will require the expenditure of an excess of $500 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.623" offset="7036203">But even if we were to assume and that the Rivergate District were to be developed and were to become the source of traffic that its developers hope, is by no mean certain and that this railroad Peninsula Terminal Company will be the access into North Rivergate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.750" offset="7116660">For one thing -- and Peninsula provides only one of three routes into the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.768" offset="7148738">The first route to which the North Rivergate area would be in extension of an industrial spur that is already on the Rivergate property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.155" offset="7222299">A second alternative would be a spur to be built and directly from the main line of the Burlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.786" offset="7252810">Rustically directly into the North Rivergate property and that land for that has been acquired, much of it has been filled and graded to permit the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.211" offset="7298576">The witnesses for the Port of Portland brotherly acknowledged that they were in these alternatives and that no selection of the route into North Rivergate had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.037" offset="7353852">The condition of the Peninsula Terminal Company and its structural limitations suggest that it really will never become the route into North Rivergate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.696" offset="7412470">Its tracks which are of relative light weight are built upon sand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.531" offset="7435772">Its clearances passing as it does dust and through a trestle, carrying the main line of the Burlington Northern overhead and has a limited dimension, and finally the line itself is loaded by the heavy curvatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.330" offset="7519050">As the Peninsula line leaves the trestle beneath the -- in Burlington Northern, it crosses at great and without electric warning device under the North Portland road which connects just a few blocks away with Interstate Highway 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.366" offset="7599194">Indeed the leading witness for the Port of Portland, Dr. Grober Plymann (ph) acknowledged that Peninsula could not handle the projected traffic to and from Rivergate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.031" offset="7653842">He acknowledged on cross examination that Peninsula would have to be redesigned, rebuilt, and the fact establishes that the 100 car trains, which he indicated the development of Rivergate required, could not even fit upon the tracks of the Peninsula Terminal Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.330" offset="8738968">This comes about as follows: The lines that the Southern Pacific terminate in East Portland, some distance from the Peninsula Terminal Company for its cars to reach the Peninsula Terminal Company requires that the Southern Pacific turn over its cars to the Union Pacific, and that transfer occurs at the so-called Albina Yard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.575" offset="8875954">The cars as they are turned over by the Southern Pacific to the Union Pacific include cars destined to other points and other industries on the Union Pacific Lines, they are mingled in the transfer trains with other Union Pacific cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.492" offset="8951605">The train then proceeds to affect the deliveries to the various industries along the line goes to the Canton Yard and eventually does wind up at Peninsula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.835" offset="8997058">Now at such times as the Southern Pacific tenders sufficient traffic to justify it and the Union Pacific is perfectly delighted that they could train all through and affect that connection more rapidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.231" offset="9066648">Finally I submit Mr. Justice Blackmun now there is simply was no complaint by any shipper that's on the Peninsula under the service currently being received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.322" offset="9131014">I started to say that the Peninsula at its dealings with the trunk-line railroads reaching Portland will be no different following the ownership by the Burlington Northern and the Union Pacific than obtains presently on the Portland Traction Company or the Portland Terminal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.227" offset="9218576">And the Southern Pacific and the Milwaukee no less and the Burlington Northern and the Union Pacific they will be able to publish single line rates turned from Portland, and under such rates render service to industries on the Peninsula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.930" offset="9293391">In fact, they had done so as I hope to develop later on Southern Pacific has participated to the extent that 20% of all Peninsula’s traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.044" offset="9349816">I think that the appellant railroads misconceived in what are the rights and the opportunities afforded to the Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern as a result of their ownership of the Peninsula Terminal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.065" offset="9413972">And the support of the public bodies I think is equally incorrectly premised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.498" offset="9431631">First, they contend that as owners of the Peninsula, Burlington Northern and Union Pacific and will be able to operate their trains on the Peninsula tracks, thereby avoiding a time consuming interchange and their switch of equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2365.202" offset="9534449">That in order for the Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern to get on the tracks of the Peninsula and they will need to file an application with the Interstate Commerce Commission for trackage rights under Section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act and protestants will have an opportunity to be heard at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.365" offset="12655141">I was going to say that the Calumet Harbor case that is known before you is, and Illinois Central versus Norfolk &amp; Western case 385 U.S. 57, is distinguishable in that and there as this Court noted, one trunk line railroad actually operated into the port area under consideration and all other trunk line railroads are seeking to serve that Port had to depend on the facility of that one railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.976" offset="12781574">That situation does not here obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.318" offset="12798919">The Burlington Northern and Union Pacific will not operate on the tracks of the Peninsula.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.366" offset="12839148">Their cars just as the cars of the Milwaukee and the Southern Pacific will need to be interchanged to switch into the Peninsula and the solicitation efforts of the four railroads each will stand on equal footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.545" offset="12895886">Southern Pacific as I indicated earlier therefore has participated in 20% of the traffic to and from Peninsula.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.560" offset="12931935">Even it was a disadvantage of its lines terminating 5-6 miles from Peninsula at East Portland and it is being dependent on intervening movement by the Union Pacific or the Burlington Northern to reach the Peninsula industries.0</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.970" offset="13021587">I think the hard facts of this case show that we have a little railroad with light traffic and little prospect for great expansion and the Commission on balance determined that there simply were not sufficient advantages in a four part ownership to be able to find and that inclusion of the Milwaukee and the Southern Pacific would be consistent with the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3331.180" offset="13398377">I will just very briefly answer a few comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.544" offset="13415827">I referred the Court to take the time we have allotted to our brief and the Justice Department brief which points out what the Commission did and did not find as contrasted to what have the Commission now argues before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.535" offset="13475804">They have made no findings similar to what is being argued here today and I commend our briefs to you on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.607" offset="13504121">Counsel has made much in his brief and much in his argument of matters that are entirely outside the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.127" offset="13534214">He spends a great deal of time in his brief and in his argument on the reciprocal switching arrangement which was not entered into at all, before this case was decided and on its way up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.212" offset="13578518">So how can the Commission have taken into account the reciprocal switching arrangement when it was not even entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.703" offset="13608506">I am also advised by a counsel for Milwaukee that my statement that I made on Peninsula and insisting upon the division rates is absolutely accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.213" offset="13646541">And it has had great deal of difficulty in publishing these rates upon its entry to Portland that is outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.147" offset="13674230">But we have been arguing outside the record as counsel has begun.</text>
