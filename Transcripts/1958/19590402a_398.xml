            <text syncTime="16.251" offset="168417">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.805" offset="186598">This proceeding was commenced by the City of Thibodaux filing a suit in the District Court of Lafourche Parish state court, relying solely on the authority of Act 111 of 1900, an act which had never been interpreted by any state decision or state court decision and as far as we know had never been invoked before as a basis for a condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.741" offset="302373">The defendant, the Louisiana Power &amp; Light, removed the case to the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.160" offset="327973">After a -- after removal, the defendant filed answer in which it raised about eight of ten questions under state law involving the interpretation of the state act, the application of the state act, validity of the state act and its -- and several other questions of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.181" offset="420133">At the pre-trial conference, the District Judge concluded to hear the issues of law prior to going into the matter of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.523" offset="465481">Argument was held at some great length in the District Court on these issues of law, and the District Court proceeded to exercise the questions of state law and grant a stay of proceedings until these questions should be decided by a Supreme Court of Louisiana interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.906" offset="578957">His reasons for doing this is, he points out, that although the power of eminent domain is inhere in the sovereign, it is never delegated to subdivisions by implication and that it is a power that is brought with great peril, a possibility of abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.833" offset="682715">He then finds that there had been no state decisions interpreting this law, but that there has been an Attorney General's opinion in 1951 which is to the effect that municipalities do not have the power to condemn utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.460" offset="789191">He, therefore, granted the stay, pending that proceeding.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Raburn Monroe</label>
            <text syncTime="183.629" offset="837883">That was -- I was going to come to the specific answers, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.549" offset="861602">Well going -- I'll go back and fill in the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.848" offset="882813">Louisiana Power &amp; Light Company operates in about 44 parishes in the Louisiana and the property here involved in this condemnation suit was a property in the suburbs of the City of Thibodaux.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.341" offset="944776">Thibodaux which operates a municipal plant expanded its city limits and then sought to bring this condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.627" offset="985840">As I say Louisiana Power &amp; Light operates a general electric utility, it generates electricity at remote points from Thibodaux and Monroe, Louisiana and in New Orleans, Louisiana, transmits that by high power transmission lines and then distributes it in Thibodaux.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.225" offset="1084270">I bring this point out because part of the property involved here is not just a property within the city, new city limits of Thibodaux, but it is that portion that was built, that capacity that was built in all the way back to the power plant for the purpose of serving this area, which is one of the questions as to the applicability of this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.967" offset="1191267">Now this act of 1900 speaks of -- says that municipality can condemn a plant and it goes on to say that if the person owning the plant owns two or more utility plants such as water plant, gas plant at the city condemning this, condemn all of the plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.133" offset="1279875">And so the question or one of the questions state law arising here is whether the city would be required in this case to condemn the entire property of the Louisiana Power &amp; Light which would raise a question as to its state constitutionality, if it was so interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.090" offset="1351764">That is, courtesy of -- in one parish operate a general utility system throughout the state of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.404" offset="1397008">Going on to the -- I might add here also the city of, the city is seeking here also to condemn the right of the Louisiana Power &amp; Light to operate in this section of the city, that is its franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.103" offset="1487809">Now Louisiana Power &amp; Light operates in that section by virtue of three franchises granted by the parish of Lafourche prior to the taking in of this territory by the city and the reason that the city wants to expropriate a portion of those franchise rights in this area is for the reason that the rates charged by the city to its inhabitants for residential service are approximately 55% higher than the rates charged by Louisiana Power &amp; Light company, so that the city couldn't -- would not long-haul to any customers if they took the property, if we still had the right to operate in that territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.029" offset="1695535">So -- and we -- we say that a careful examination of the statute will show that they are not specifically granted a right to acquire a franchise or a portion of the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.792" offset="1750497">Well as I say we raise about eight or nine different questions of state law in this proceeding and unless the Court wants to me, I won't go into them all, it took about an hour's argument before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.474" offset="1813295">When the order of -- the sale order was entered by the District Court, the City of Thibodaux appealed and we filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the order was an interlocutory order which is not appealable under the Judicial Code, Section 1291.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.195" offset="1900126">The Court of Appeal consolidated the appeal and the motion to dismiss, both argued the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.342" offset="1928756">In argument on the – on the motion to dismiss, the City of Thibodaux argued that this was, this stay order was in effect an injunction setting the doctrine stemming from the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.362" offset="1992808">In other words, that in granting a stay the District Court was acting as a chancellor in equity, staying a proceeding or enjoining a proceeding on the law side of the case -- we -- which if it was a in junction, would be one of the exceptions provided in Judicial Code Section 1292 Sub 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.489" offset="2113285">In the -- this doctrine has been (Inaudible), but in practically all the cases citing this doctrine it has differentiated the action of a court in granting the stay, acting as a chancellor in equity, enjoining a different proceeding and the action of the judge in the orderly process of trying a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.938" offset="2235120">In all the cases, I admit that a judge trying a case where that law in equity has the inherent power and has discretion in handling the ordinary progress of the case to grant a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.674" offset="2314115">We claim that this is what this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.828" offset="2334699">This is a exercise of the judge in orderly conduct of the case, granting a stay and we cite in our brief number of cases which have recognized specifically right of a court at law as distinguished from equity, court at law to grant a stay as a matter of its inherent power.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.674" offset="2442115">Now if -- now in this particular case there was no equitable claim made.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.483" offset="2473253">The court simply, in the same action before it, after the hearing the evidence on the argument and deciding that in view of the general law that the – following Erie v. Tompkins, that the state interpretation of state statutes should be followed by the federal court and finding no guide of any sort in the state jurisprudence, exercise his prerogative as a court at law in the control of proceedings to stay that particular segment.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.087" offset="2619747">Now he did not -- he did not dismiss the suit and he still retained jurisdiction insofar as federal question is concerned, insofar as the compensation is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.195" offset="2676172">So we say if this is what it is, an exercise of indiscretion of the Court, by then this suit is not appealable, because it's interlocutory order clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.241" offset="2744299">Now we come to the second question which we raise, which is the question of abusive discretion and that is, was the Court -- if the Court in granting the stay went so far beyond its discretion as a Court at law as to actually constitute this an injunction which makes the case appealable so that it gets here, then is his action nevertheless within his discretion as in granting such a injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.766" offset="2914408">Now we rely principally in this connection on the case of Leiter Minerals, which we believe is the last pronouncement in this subject in controlling, and that was the case on which the District Court relied, that's Leiter Minerals Inc., versus United States, 352 U.S. 220.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.954" offset="3023182">In that case, if I can recall fact to you, the Leiter filed a predatory action in the State Court seeking to establish title, the suit was against the mineral lessee of the United States government and he sought to establish title under an interpretation of a 1940 Louisiana statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.073" offset="3155675">The United States government and the lessee went into the Federal Court and brought a suit to quite title, and also asked for an injunction staying proceedings in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.044" offset="3219519">The Court below granted the injunction and the Court of Appeals affirmed this and directed the District Court to go ahead and decide the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.399" offset="3276988">This Court, however, affirmed the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, affirmed the issuing of the injunction staying state proceedings, but then directed the district judge to stay further proceedings in the District Court until such time as a determination could be made of the state law, of interpretation of state statute, by the state courts of Louisiana and we say that this is precisely the same situation as in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.200" offset="3424214">Now we also cite and rely on the Spector case, Spector Motor Company case, which involved an injunction to enjoin the collection of a tax on the ground that it pins down the communist power.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.416" offset="3545004">In that case also, this Court held that a stay should be granted until such time as the case could be determined or the statute interpreted by a Connecticut Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.808" offset="3634552">There are two leading cases which might be considered in conflict with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.618" offset="3669870">One of them is the case of Meredith versus Winter Haven, involving a suit to enjoin -- a suit involving a question of Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.785" offset="3738520">In that case the Federal District Court had decided the case under Florida law against the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.877" offset="3778853">The Court of Appeals decided, affirmed the dismissal, but made it without prejudice to the plaintiff proceeding in the Florida Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.934" offset="3839143">And the Supreme Court held that it was the -- that this thing, the diversity citizenship case, that it could not -- the Federal Court could not just relax all of its jurisdiction and dismiss a suit, it had -- and that is a case that has very frequently cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.444" offset="3949171">I think there are two differences or distinctions with that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.208" offset="3972159">In the first place here the Court has retained jurisdiction, the District Court has, and as to the compensation question and as to the questions, federal questions and had just temporarily stayed proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.383" offset="4048854">And furthermore in the Florida case, the Meredith versus Winter Haven, the Supreme Court of Florida had passed on this very point, which was -- which the Federal Court was asked to pass on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.102" offset="4127744">The argument was simply that they would probably overrule this previous decision because a certain argument had not been made to them, so that there was a guide by which the Federal Court could go in an existing final interpretation of the law by Supreme Court of Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.969" offset="4875264">The City of Thibodaux wanted an industrial customer, the Coca Cola Company and they wanted to serve a college was newly being built just outside their city limits and they proceeded to enter into a contract with Louisiana Power &amp; Light company which is printed in I think page 36 in the record, in which they agreed that if we would transfer this industrial customer and this college to them for service that they would recognize our rights to continue indefinitely to serve in a territory which was then served, which is the territory here in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.784" offset="5190510">I must admit the statute which, under which this suit was brought we considered, gave a very, a cause of remedy which we considered very prejudicial to ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.977" offset="5271280">For example, it provides for the appointment of six commissioners by the court and these six commissioners are to go and view the property, appraise it and make a report within 15 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.612" offset="5337840">Well, suffice it to say I don't think you could possibly even inventory properly of this description of utility system within 15 days and of course these six commissioners, if you, the record will show, were appointed by the Judge the same day that the suit was filed, even before we were served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.495" offset="5437315">The act makes no provision for giving evidence to these commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.015" offset="5463437">It makes no provision for hearings or for cross examining witnesses, it does say that after they have filed their report in the court that any party can object and the case will be tried out the usual manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.688" offset="5534072">But when you got – go into court and you have six so called impartial experts put in a testimony you then have a great burden if you are going to contest it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.764" offset="5602408">And so -- in addition to that the act provides for a summary appeal with no, we call it suspended deal no supercilious.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.049" offset="7631600">The first question raised by the granting of the writ here, was the one of the power of the District Court to issue the stay order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.121" offset="7671829">The question of appealability of that stay order, which has been discussed by opposing counsel, was expressly eliminated by the order of granting the writ, the order of this Court granting the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.764" offset="7722402">As to the question whether the District Court had a right as a matter of power to grant the stay of proceedings before it, we had not anticipated that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.551" offset="7769527">In fact, we had conceded it before the District Court and before the Court of Appeal and only took it up at the invitation of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.019" offset="7803486">However, having once investigated it, we found that it was very doubtful, though not at all definite, whether this type of order, in this type of case was authorized, as distinct from the question of whether it was an abuse of discretion or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.959" offset="7899199">The jurisprudence of this Court, and that's all we've dealt with on this question, is to the effect that a court in an equitable proceeding, a court appealed to on the equity side, may grant such as a stay order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.541" offset="7965550">It has been allowed also in cases involving admiralty, bankruptcy and even in a couple a law cases, strictly law cases as distinguished from admiralty or bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.006" offset="8027408">However, in those two cases, the only two law cases involved, the stay was found necessary only because of a necessary preliminary administrative ruling or because the statute involved directed that the preliminary determination be made by another agency before the question came before a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.141" offset="8135973">There is no ordinary civil case in which this Court has either authorized or directed a stay of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.033" offset="8175470">There is, however, language in two cases to the affect that stay orders are authorized because of the inherent power of all courts to conduct their proceedings in orderly manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2052.799" offset="8314546">And we don't think it makes any difference whether it delays its decision because it's curious to know what another tribunal in a similar case is going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.983" offset="8355297">We think it would have been perfectly proper in this case, for the District Court to say there is another case pending in the Louisiana Supreme Court, which is going to pass on this question, it is only proper that we await that determination, which will not control ours, but which may guide ours and which may under the Erie versus Tompkins case, insofar as it's applicable to this case, even control this case.</text>
