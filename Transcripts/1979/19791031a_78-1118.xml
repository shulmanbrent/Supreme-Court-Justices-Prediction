            <text syncTime="77.161" offset="411982">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.983" offset="431313">The issue before the Court, in our case, is whether certain scientific records that are presently located in a Maryland bank vault are federal records and are disclosable under the Federal Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.468" offset="489200">The committee for the Care of the Diabetic, of which petitioners are members, initiated a formal Freedom of Information Act request from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.163" offset="532041">In 1974, the data resulting from a scientific study which has been called the UGDP Study.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.606" offset="561821">The study involves the treatment and evaluation of the treatment of diabetes.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.425" offset="589093">This request was denied administratively and we filed an action with the District Court in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.801" offset="614588">Our request for relief was denied by Judge Corcoran in that Court -- denied essentially on the grounds that the federal government did not posses the data and therefore the request for UGDP records in the Court’s judgment were not at agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.043" offset="679581">In the U.S. Court of Appeals, we again were denied in a 2:1 decision to release the data, but all three judges rejected the strict possession property test called upon by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.768" offset="734438">Judge Leventhal in the majority opinion set a standard where he defined agency records to include records created or obtained by an agency in the course of doing its work.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.109" offset="779786">In elaborating on this test, he stated that agency records are not limited to the physical possession of an agency but it can include the records which are created and held by private entities where the agency is involved in the core planning or execution of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.847" offset="854810">Judge MacKinnon in his concurrence also stated that agency records can include those created by private entities and said that the determination of whether or not the agency records must be made will be done on a factual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.931" offset="919071">Judge Bazelon dissented and stated that the records created and held by private entities are agency records when the government has been significantly involved in the study in its records.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.977" offset="971316">What is interesting --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="218.021" offset="975496">What would be involvement, beyond finances or limited to finances and definition of the project?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_sonnenreich" startTime="228.326" stopTime="474.888">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Sonnenreich</label>
            <text syncTime="228.326" offset="1016665">No, Mr. Chief Justice, there are essentially -- we have set it out in our brief at pages 53 through 55, but essentially there are four major factors that show government involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.003" offset="1063372">The first is a question of funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.240" offset="1076328">We have demonstrated in the brief, and we are going to discuss this, that you not only have a funding over a period of more than 15 years, we not only have a funding where the exclusive funding agency is the federal government and the amount involved was in excess of $15 million, but in addition, the government also funded the planning grants -- a two-year planning grant to initiate the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.650" offset="1177997">Another factor that was extremely important in terms of showing involvement is the fact that the monitoring and the supervision by the National Institutes of Health in the project itself, or we have demonstrated in our case, in our brief that some of that involvement is instructive to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.744" offset="1254379">For example, they established a Policy Planning Board and they put members of the National Institute of Health on that board, one of the senior officials being the Chairman of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.043" offset="1299519">They were very actively involved in analyzing and evaluating the actual planning and policy of the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.189" offset="1344136">More important in respect to that second factor was that the Board met regularly at the National Institute of Health to review the actual progress of the study, which in and of itself was unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.695" offset="1402128">More unusual still was that NIH, because of some of the questions that had been raised, went outside and contracted with an independent group of statisticians -- the Biometric Society to actually go in and evaluate the raw data of the study.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.956" offset="1471195">This is not a usual activity on the part of the National Institute of Health or of HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.012" offset="1499408">As a matter of fact, Dr. Donald Whedon in his memorandum, in his affidavit before the lower court so stated that that is, in fact, a very rare occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.635" offset="1537964">A third important factor to show the substantial Government involvement was the action -- by the action of the Government in terms of regulatory action.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.014" offset="1579447">What is important is that while the National Institutes of Health were monitoring and supervising the study, another sub-agency of HEW -- the Food and Drug Administration -- began to take a series of very significant steps in reliance on this study.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.711" offset="1650186">In 1970, the FDA sent a series of drug bulletins to all physicians in the United States advising them of the findings of the study and warning them about its implications in the treatment of their diabetic patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.927" offset="1711104">These bulletins were then followed by the Food and Drug Administration making a proposed rule re-labeling the oral hypoglycemics by inserting a warning based on this UGDP study.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.474" offset="1757288">This proposal was first discussed by the FDA in 1972 and was finally proposed in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.443" offset="1785187">In 1977, in direct reliance, the Secretary of HEW proposed that one of the drugs in the UGDP study, Phenformin, be suspended from the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.659" offset="1846000">Again, the Secretary relied heavily on the UGDP data and the UGDP study.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.480" offset="1877243">From all of these regulatory activities, ranging from official bulletins of the FDA that went directly to physicians to proposed rule-making to regulatory proceedings, the Government relied heavily on the UGDP as the justification for its actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.951" offset="1943176">But the most important of these effects is the fourth and final factor that I think is clear showing of reliance on the part of the Government, and that is when the Government itself through the FDA decided to audit the raw data.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.888" offset="2002944">Let me back up a little bit.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.054" offset="2059577">What has happened is that the lower courts have been evolving a series of standards because the statutory language does not speak directly to what constitutes agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.784" offset="2114539">And what is before this Court, petitioners contend, is trying to amalgamate or define with more precision what it is, what type of test has to be utilized now in terms of determining what are agency records.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="534.440" offset="2241181">But you tell us very early in your brief that in this case, we cannot rely on the statutory language.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Sonnenreich</label>
            <text syncTime="544.411" offset="2280991">The statutory language in this particular case, Your Honor, is silent on what constitutes agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.598" offset="2309726">What has happened is that the Courts have had to evolve a series of tests to determine what those actions are.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.757" offset="2338356">The statutory intent is very clear, and that is that the intent of the statute is to permit disclosure, and is to make the Government accountable for the activities and the actions that it performs.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.745" offset="2386317">The problem that we deal with now and the reason why we feel this case is so important is that in defining the threshold issue of what constitutes the agency records, we are also defining what is the accountability of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.811" offset="2462595">The problem that we have in defining, it is the only way you can examine and determine what are those agency records as to look directly at the involvement of the Government and then interpret what that action of the Government is in the determination of what is the agency record.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.236" offset="2532289">The statute, the only thin light or light that we get is the Attorney General's memorandum opinion of 1967 which has some definition of what constitutes agency records in the sense that he makes two separate distinctions and they talk in terms of possession or control.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.262" offset="2620374">The problem is that the Courts have had a great deal of trouble in trying to determine possessory standards and apply possessory standards to the Freedom of Information Act, because they are involved in this balancing and this weighing of what it is that the Act really intends for the Government to do in terms of making it accountable, and on the other hand, trying to make certain that the uncertainties are not so great that the Act encompasses everything.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.930" offset="4083127">The reason, as I stated, was for that audit to determine the validity of the study and the integrity of the database.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.625" offset="4113847">This is in contrast to the Biometric’s audit which was contracted for by NIH.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.195" offset="4132133">The Food and Drug Administration decided to audit the data itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.277" offset="4148433">It physically went out to the coordinating center in Baltimore, selected data, examined the data, copied some parts of the data, and then took back limited portions of the data that they had seen back to Rockville, Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.554" offset="4225546">What happened was that after completing the audit, the Food and Drug Administration then published its findings as final findings in November of 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.366" offset="4264835">It then went back and renewed its proposal of three years earlier, which was to require a warning be placed on all oral hypoglycemic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.803" offset="4302555">The central issue in this case we submit, is whether the raw data of the study funded by the Government, monitored by the Government, relied upon by the Government, and even audited by the Government, are Agency records under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.134" offset="5407953">What we are talking about is the Government relied on a conclusion, and in order for the Government to deal with data, the Government has to analyze, evaluate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.116" offset="7615822">This case concerns the definition of agency records under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.072" offset="7639646">In the Government's view, agency records are records relating to the affairs of a Federal agency that are in the possession and control of that agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.467" offset="7681233">As we have explained at some length in our brief, we believe that this definition is first of all supported by the language of the FOIA which requires all Federal agencies to "make available agency records," and which prohibits agencies from "withholding" such records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.810" offset="7758660">Giving this language its ordinary commonsense meaning, we contend that an agency can neither make available nor withhold what it does not possess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.789" offset="7798575">Moreover, this definition also finds support in the legislative history of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.967" offset="7823235">Legislative debates show quite clearly that what Congress was principally concerned about in passing the FOIA and what was thought to be the principal defect under the predecessor of the FOIA, Section 3(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, was that Federal agencies had refused to divulge public documents that were in their unquestioned possession and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.947" offset="7915186">There is not a shred of evidence in the voluminous congressional hearings or committee reports or floor debates to indicate that Congress intended the Act to reach documents in the hands of private parties that happened to do business with the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2021.769" offset="8190412">But we think that the FOIA only requires Government agencies to turn over to the public on request records agencies that are in their possession and control when the request comes in.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="2197.102" stopTime="2368.273">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="2197.102" offset="8891747">Well, we believe that the agency records definition under the FOIA includes everything that is a Federal record under the Federal Records Act if it is in the Government's possession and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.015" offset="8939395">Now, there is a question whether something that is not a Federal record under the Federal Records Act but is instead non-record materials has to be turned over under the FOIA if it's in the Government's possession and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.983" offset="8987355">We discussed that issue in Footnote 38 of our brief in the Kissinger case, to be argued next, and I think that is an unsettled question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.330" offset="9024658">But we think at the very least the definition of agency records in the FOIA includes everything that is a Federal record under the Federal Records Act, if it is in the Government's possession at the time the FOIA request comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.728" offset="9082232">Now, as I was saying, the legislative history includes nothing to support petitioner's theory of agency records, and we think it is unlikely that Congress would have intended that result without some discussion of what Judge Leventhal correctly termed the, "awesome implications" that such a result would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.177" offset="9164048">Indeed, it seems entirely reasonable to conclude that in referring to agency records when enacting the FOIA, Congress was aware of and, as Mr. Justice Blackmun just mentioned, meant to rely at least in part on the definition of Federal records in the Federal Records Act and the Records Disposal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.668" offset="9238026">This definition refers to documentary materials that are made or received by an agency in connection with the transaction of public business, and that are preserved or appropriate for preservation by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.284" offset="9292466">And once again, we think that this definition plainly suggests that only documents in an agency's possession and control were meant to be included within the disclosure requirements of the FOIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.401" offset="9340949">Finally, we believe that the test we have proposed which focuses on actual or constructive possession has the benefit of being easy to apply in the various different and unpredictable situations in which this issue is likely to arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.262" offset="9404374">Now, as applied in this case, this definition of agency records yields a clear result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.095" offset="9427780">The UGDP raw data that petitioners have sought are not now and have never been in the possession of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare or any other Federal agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.363" offset="9476786">As the District Court found, the data had at all times since their creation been in the sole possession of the UGDP, which is a private research group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.296" offset="9516596">In light of these undisputed findings, we think that the District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly held that the data are not agency records within 552(A)3 and (A)4 of Title 5, and that they need not be produced to Petitioners under the FOIA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2376.679" offset="9610115">Well, as to the right of access, petitioners make it seem as if the NIH or the FDA have an unlimited and unrestricted right of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.844" offset="9654732">As I hope to discuss a little later, this is untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.209" offset="9664240">The right of access, we believe and in the affidavit of Dr. Whedon in the record supports, is only a right of access for purposes of the grant; it is not an unlimited right of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.518" offset="9709484">The FDA has exercised that right of access, as petitioners pointed out, and in conducting its audit, some of the raw data of the UGDP project did come into FDA's possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.752" offset="9758386">It was brought back from Baltimore to the NIH headquarters in Rockville.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.040" offset="9779493">All of that data has been turned over to petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.348" offset="9792763">So, we are not talking here about any data that ever came into the Government's possession and control, because that's all been made available to the Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.060" offset="9823587">So, your answer, Mr. Chief Justice, would be yes, if the grant allowed it and the access regulations approved of it, the Government could make copies, and at that point they may well be agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.012" offset="9871444">It is not an issue in this case, because every document of that sort that was actually copied and brought back into the NIH's possession was made available to petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.739" offset="9914284">Now, the problem that we see with petitioner's contrary theory of the agency records provisions of the Freedom of Information Act is that there is really no theory at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.731" offset="9950333">Petitioner's submission, although obviously designed to convince the Court that they should be given access to the UGDP data at issue in this case, is based on no principle standards for determining when documents in general are agency records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.826" offset="10006653">Therefore, offers this Court virtually no guidance in deciding when any of the literally billions of documents in the hands of private groups that deal with or receive money from the Federal Government should be considered agency records within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.034" offset="10063496">Let me explain what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.368" offset="10068825">Petitioners have never claimed that the UGDP itself is a Federal agency under the FOIA and any such claim would be totally untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.622" offset="10105814">Agency is a defined term under the act and the UGDP, which is an organization of private and State University medical research groups working at private and State institutions clearly does not satisfy the statutory definition of agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.535" offset="10173524">What petitioners have instead contended in this litigation is that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare is the relevant agency under the FOIA, and then they have attempted to argue that the raw data in the hands of the UGDP are agency records of HEW by emphasizing every conceivable connection between the data in any branch or agency of HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.413" offset="10269027">They specifically rely on three main factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.954" offset="10279163">First, they claim that the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Disorders, which is a part of the Public Health Service within HEW was significantly involved in the design, implementation and funding of the UGDP study that led to the raw data.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.597" offset="10353768">Second, they claim that NIAMDD enjoys an absolute right of access to the UGDP data under its grant regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.436" offset="10393161">And third, they claim that the Food and Drug Administration, which is a separate agency within HEW, has taken the UGDP data into account for the purposes of regulatory decision-making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.484" offset="10441331">According to Petitioners, it is the combination of these three factors that somehow turns the UGDP data which unquestionably are owned, they concede, possessed and controlled by a private organization, into HEW agency records, that must be turned over to any person.</text>

            <text syncTime="2887.074" offset="11651636">I think it is important, though, to realize we are talking about agency records for FOIA purposes, and the definition exists in the same sentence with the words "withhold" and "make available."</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.084" offset="11699702">We think they give meaning to what Congress meant by the words "agency records."</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.899" offset="11723003">We believe that the Court should reject the essentially standardless approach to the definition of "agency records" that petitioners offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.231" offset="11756335">As I have already mentioned, there is nothing in the Act itself or in its legislative history to suggest that Congress meant it to reach papers or other materials in private hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.579" offset="11789667">Perhaps more importantly, petitioner's approach would lead to more problems than it could possibly solve, because unless the exception carved in the FOIA at petitioner's behest were to be limited to the UGDP documents alone or to other private documents that were produced under the circumstances virtually identical to the UGDP data, in other words all the four factors they rely on existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.438" offset="11881096">It would be difficult, if not impossible, to identify limiting criteria in order to prevent literally billions of other private documents from falling within the disclosure requirements of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.606" offset="11925817">Now, petitioners, as I have noted, have stressed three, or now they say four particular factors that they believe make the private UGDP records in this case sufficiently Federal to require their release under the FOIA, but some of these factors would apply equally to almost every meaningful document in the hands of a private group that receives Federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.546" offset="12013589">And I might add at this point that there were over 16,000 Government research grants in existence in 1978 and that all Federal grants of one sort or another accounted for nearly one-fifth of the Federal Government's budget outlays that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.607" offset="12073775">In other words, by making the producibility of a document in private hands turn on a balancing of an unknown number of variables, including such subjective considerations as the substantiality of the Federal agency's funding or monitoring of the private project that produced the records, or the scope of the granting agency's access rights to the records, or the degree of the agency's reliance on the final report prepared by the grantee through the use of the records –</text>

            <text syncTime="3147.024" offset="12691519">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.957" offset="12703222">There are three reasons why we believe that Congress never intended the Federal Freedom of Information Act to apply to the records of private citizens and private and state institutions that receive Federal grants, and also why the Act should not be extended to such records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.317" offset="12780648">First, such extension of the Federal Freedom of Information Act would be contrary to the very basic premise of the Freedom of Information Act, which is the right of the people to know what their government is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.047" offset="12835610">The second reason is that such an extension of the Freedom of Information Act to the records of grant recipients would significantly alter the basic relationship between the Federal Government and grant recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.086" offset="12891721">Third, the application of the act to the records of such grant recipients, such as the university records of the University Group Diabetes Program, would have a staggering adverse impact upon grant recipients whether they be researchers or whether they be state and local governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.956" offset="12971238">Before I discuss these points further, I would like to respond to some of the points that were made earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.724" offset="12998301">I would just like to point out to the Court that the record is very clear in this case that not only did only the UGDP have possession of the records, but they had control of the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.833" offset="13046680">The District Court so found, and Dr. Whedon's affidavit at page 147 of the Appendix clearly sets forth that the day-to-day management of the University Group was in the hands of the University Group and not the National Institutes of Health or any other agency of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.788" offset="13134555">It is also helpful to remember what are not issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.011" offset="13151378">The validity of the findings of the University Group study is not an issue in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.791" offset="13254510">Similarly, the issue of whether the University Group records ought to be released to the public at some time in the future is not an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.320" offset="13292648">The issue here is whether individuals and private and state institutions that receive federal grants but otherwise retain their independence and autonomy, or in the case of a state or local government, their sovereignty, the right of those individuals to determine when, to what extent, and under what circumstances their records will be revealed to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.875" offset="13418872">Let us say if the Federal Government in some way interferes with the independence of the that may be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.760" offset="13458369">One of the important principles that is recognized in our society is the right of individuals and private and state entities to pursue their own goals with a minimum of interference from the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.481" offset="13745298">I think they could make that definition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.852" offset="13790751">But I think the point is here that any time the Congress has circumscribed the freedom of a grant recipient to take action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.993" offset="13827323">Grant recipients may not discriminate on the basis of race, may not discriminate against the handicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.964" offset="13847280">Congress has specifically so provided, either in the enabling legislation for the grant or in another Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.613" offset="13877791">In this case, Congress has not stated that the records of grant recipients are federal agency records, and I think that that fact in itself is conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.276" offset="13928469">In addition, the fact of the staggering impact that the extension of the Act would have upon conducting research and the federal program of supporting research suggests very strongly that Congress would not and did not intend the Act to apply to these records simply because they did not address these policy issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.885" offset="14014882">These policy issues are substantial, as the Court of Appeals pointed out, and Congress at the very least, if they had wanted to do this and had intended to do this, would have discussed those policy questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3498.448" offset="14097115">I simply want to point out few things to the Court, and that is with respect to the Right of Access.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.221" offset="14124283">The Right of Access is clear in the contract made between the Government and the UGDP, and the regulations of HEW, Section 74.23 clearly allow the right of access to copy the records, take the records, analyze the records, and make an audit, so that the contract between the parties is very clearly allowing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.710" offset="14214248">In addition, I point out to the Court that the FDA which stepped in to do the audit has its own regulation, 21 CFR 20.105(d), which equally makes it, all the raw data, available to any research that had been conducted by the FDA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.082" offset="14279659">The only question I posit for the Court is the question that what we are involved with here is two agencies, one of which would have allowed under its own regulation all the raw data given, as opposed to another agency that does not, and the question is, we are in a question of agency shopping.</text>
