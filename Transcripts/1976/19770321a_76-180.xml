            <text syncTime="262.293" offset="1149624">It is only if the parents’ rights can subsequently be terminated in a proceeding which New York provides for termination of parental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.785" offset="1207615">For example, a parent places a child; and she recovers, never comes to see the child, New York after a certain point can bring a proceeding to terminate the parent’s parental rights, and then the child is available for adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.914" offset="1292148">But it is not anticipated that any voluntary foster-care placement with the foster parent is an adoptive placement, not at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.507" offset="1882515">It requires this explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.888" offset="1904040">Until about six years ago, this whole system was an administrative system without any kinds of legal checks for the parent, for the child, for the foster parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.454" offset="1978332">So, for example, if a parent wanted a child returned, there was no mechanism which would ensure that the child was returned.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.885" offset="2040086">One of my clients, Ms. Rodriguez, was a person who placed her child, wanted her child three months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.638" offset="2071015">Although the law does provide habeas corpus, no one advised her that it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.252" offset="2093480">So she just kept going to the agency and saying, "I want my child" and I tried to document in the record as much as I could and in my brief how that could cause time to pass, even though the mother wanted the child and even though the mother was not unfit.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.871" offset="2176027">So that was one problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.515" offset="2194522">The other problem is, the agency had no accountability independently aside from the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.533" offset="2226600">Now, the purpose of the Foster-Care Review, which was enacted in, well, roughly 1972 and has gone through a series of transformations, was to provide an accountability mechanism so that this does not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.615" offset="2294936">In 1975, New York passed a Social Services Law Section 384(a), which provides when a parent asks for a child, the State must return the child or go to court, and there has to be an immediate hearing showing why the child should not be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.041" offset="2368706">Now, what we have in the foster-care system now are children who are still, you might say, the residue of the old system.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.071" offset="2424817">In Ms. Wallace’s case, those children who were in placement for four years -- she had six children -- after two years the agency returned two children to her with the idea that if she managed with the two, in a while the others would come home.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.754" offset="2495557">Now, this is not an unusual approach where there are many children and there is a mother who has gone through a depression.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.267" offset="2561594">So that's the explanation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1079.971" offset="4420363">And when I'm talking about the children, I'm not talking about delinquent children; I'm talking about all of the children who come into care of the State, because the parents are not able to take care of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.295" offset="4477624">Once I got into the case, I examined the complaint and decided that on behalf of the children, the relief that was being requested was really benefiting the foster parents and not the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.980" offset="4540422">And I have submitted an answer in which I have stated that none of the relief requested will be of benefit to the children, and I have asked that it be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.008" offset="4592562">However, the issue as to whether or not there is as a result a case or a controversy has already been briefed, and unless the Court wishes an answer, I do not propose to answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.996" offset="4648464">We are opposed to these mandated hearings in the first place, because we do not see the advantage to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.869" offset="4707919">As it is, a foster parent has a right to ask for at least to be heard -- not a hearing, but to be heard -- if it wishes to, and the number of foster parents that have requested to be heard in New York City since a change went in in the regulations permitting an actual hearing has been, I think, six or seven cases or at most ten cases in one year, whereas if we have a hearing here we will have upwards of thousands of cases, 2,000 and 3,000, cases, because that is the number of children who either return home or go to another facility or are placed for adoption out of the foster home, because a number of foster families adopt the children if they become free for adoption, and that is desirable; but where it is not desirable and the children have to be moved into an adoptive home.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.537" offset="4982623">The parents claimed that they had a right to consider that this child would stay with them; but when they separated, they left the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.173" offset="5025150">The child is now back in an institution, because they did not keep the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.909" offset="5044167">There was no counter-obligation on the part of the foster family to keep the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.898" offset="5088053">The issue as to whether or not these proceedings, which have been provided by the State of New York for determining whether or not the child should be returned, have up until now not only adequately, as far as anybody can see, determined when a child should go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.209" offset="5193379">But there is actually no evidence in the record that they are unsatisfactory, and there is no evidence in the record that a hearing would add to anything that would be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.898" offset="5244056">As a matter of fact, in the opinion, the majority of the court writes, "A hearing performs the salutary function of providing the agency with an organized forum in which to gather information".</text>

            <text syncTime="2332.940" offset="9432216">So that of the movements within foster care, one-third of them are attributable to the foster parent and the foster parent’s request.</text>

            <text syncTime="2344.287" offset="9477669">Well, as a practical manner, if you know, is that because the foster parents find this child is a problem child and they are not able to cope for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.349" offset="9509852">Is that generally the...?</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.626" offset="9514972">I think that is certainly a major reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.533" offset="9522600">Another reason would be that I think some foster parents are suited, for example, to a younger child who is more sedentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.319" offset="9549767">When the child becomes more physically active and engaging in more different kinds of things, a foster parent finds it more difficult to exercise supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.065" offset="9592713">Now, what would the effect of the District Court’s decisions be that there are going to now be automatic hearings in virtually every case where a child has been in a foster home for one year or more?</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.617" offset="9642972">Obviously, that decision would require a stay of removal during the period where the hearing is scheduled, takes place and a decision is rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.734" offset="9679439">And such stays would probably be issued during the course of appellate reviews that are available under the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.470" offset="9706397">And what happens with the substantive decisions that are ultimately rendered in these administrative hearings and the review and in the judicial hearings, which are presently available under New York Law?</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.688" offset="9751224">If the District Court’s decision is affirmed by this Court, New York judges will read it as a mandate to put a new weight in the scale, the child’s liberty interest in the foster-care relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.987" offset="9800438">And since this liberty interest would be of constitutional magnitude, judges would ultimately give the natural parents' claim less weight than it presently has, even where such parents are neither neglectful nor abusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2620.387" offset="10582022">The natural parents had, in fact, left the children with a neighbor, and so that was considered a voluntary placement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.916" offset="10612115">Those children were with Ms. Smith for four years, and Ms. Smith repeatedly expressed her desire to adopt those children.</text>

            <text syncTime="3732.807" offset="15031720">And in fact, the foster family is the most likely family to adopt a child if a child later is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.496" offset="15058469">For example, Ms. Smith is now in the process of trying to adopt the foster children that have been with her since 1970.</text>

            <text syncTime="3757.089" offset="15128895">The State has, therefore, a very great interest; contrary to simply disrupting the relationship arbitrarily, a great interest in making sure that the decision to remove the child is made under constitutionally adequate procedures where everyone, including the child, has an opportunity to be heard.</text>

            <text syncTime="5521.747" offset="22187495">The foster parent can ask the court to maintain that child in his home.</text>

            <text syncTime="5556.503" offset="22326466">Now, Justice Stevens brought up the question of whether the decision below contemplated the child having some role, the decision below didn't say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.306" offset="22365754">But under 392, this judicial proceeding that we have under the Family Court Act, the child is there, and it's presumed that he will be because there's a statutory section in that, 392(6), which says that the court may dispense with the presence of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.755">So it obviously is contemplated that the child will be there and will be heard unless the court feels that it's not necessary.</text>
