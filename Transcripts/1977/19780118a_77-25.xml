            <text syncTime="77.716" offset="390836">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.930" offset="411630">The issue before the Court is the presence or absence of state action in the sale by a warehouseman of household goods, a sale of the household goods deposited by a warehouse depositor who has defaulted in payment of the storage charges, the sale being made pursuant to New York Uniform Commercial Code Section 7-210.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.278" offset="533047">The petitioner is the warehouseman.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.047" offset="548093">Respondents are two depositors of warehouse household goods while the facts in each case are not identical, they are substantially similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.091" offset="616325">Both respondents, tenants in an apartment dwelling in Mount Vernon, New York were evicted from their respective apartments by a Court Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.266" offset="665017">On the day of the eviction, the petitioner warehouseman acting on behalf of the landlord, the evicting landlord, to effectuate the removal of the household goods from the apartment to the sidewalk appeared at the apartment and entered into discussions with the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.595" offset="778284">I may point out to the Court that these two occasions did not occur on the same day, there were separate occasions on different days.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.877" offset="819453">As a result of the discussion in the Brookâs case, respondent Brooks requested that her household effects be removed from the apartment to the petitionerâs warehouse rather than leaving the goods on the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.316" offset="905239">In the Jonesa case, the respondent Jones was present with the warehouseman in the apartment at the time of discussion, made a call to the Department of Social Services for the purpose of obtaining approval for getting funds to pay the transportation charges and to pay storage charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.141" offset="1020492">This was confirmed by letter of the Department of Social Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.899" offset="1051525">The Department of Social Services approved one monthâs storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.234" offset="1088828">After a period of time elapsed, both accounts became in arrears and the warehouseman threatened to sell in conformity with Section 7-210.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.457" offset="1157791">Respondents sought an injunction relief and a declaration from the United States District Court that Section 7-210 was unconstitutional being in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.588" offset="1250265">The District Court on motion of the warehouseman dismissed the case on the ground that state action was not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.169" offset="1288612">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.370" offset="1313377">Since the Bedrock Principle of the Fourteenth Amendment is a prohibition against state action and not individual action, no matter how harmful or hurtful, the question is whether the State of New York was so involved in the sale that the action of the warehouseman maybe fairly treated as the action of the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="1172.712" offset="4770735">I think the law has been reaffirmed only a few years ago by this Court in Jackson against Metropolitan Edison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.485" offset="4801873">But I think it is worthwhile to emphasize to this Court that not only has New York passed the Uniform Commercial Code, 48 other state legislatures plus the District of Columbia have passed this Section that is under challenge here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.572" offset="4862163">So, of course it is rather obvious we have a statute with nationwide impact and this statute simply regulates and authorizes the exercise of a power of non-judicial sale by the warehouseman where his customer may have disappeared, done any sort of thing and not paid his bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.577" offset="4962265">Now, there maybe a dispute about the bill, but that is something else, that is not a constitutional dispute and as I was saying, speaking about the UCC, the statute though dates much further back in UCC which is a product of distinguished group of legal authorities of the late 50s and early 1960s, it dates back in New York back to 1879 and it is based on and I would emphasized this, it is part of a Uniform Statutory Scheme of a warehouseman having a specific possessory lien of the stored goods in his possession and the statute by regulating sale by the warehouseman is basically a wholesome statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.454" offset="5565693">As I say and I mention the Jackson against Metropolitan Edison Case which had to do with utility cut offs, this Court enumerated, it went to the extent of enumerating what a traditional functions of the state and quite interestingly, not one of them even closely approached non-judicial sale by warehouseman or anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.127" offset="5648449">It is really a total stretch of the imagination to call non-judicial sale which was only threatened in the instant case and never carried out or cannot be now, to call that a traditional function of a sheriff because a sheriff has a significant power of sovereignty that the warehouseman does not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.486" offset="5737892">Basically stated, a sheriff seizes property and this is something that the warehouseman cannot do, did not do in this case, and never will do because his lien is based on voluntary consensual possession and there is another aspect when you are speaking about state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.193" offset="5812707">It has been generally recognized that this Court and any Court is much quicker to find a delegation of state function, a traditional state function in a case that involves racial discrimination because that racial discrimination is at the heart of the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment when it was passed and what we all know is that that accredited relations really had nothing to do with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, it was not involved one iota and I think it is rather obvious that in New York, a sale by a warehouseman like they are challenging here and claiming the state action the respondents are claiming is not a traditional state function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.075" offset="6012178">Now, there is some authority in the New York Court of Appeals which the respondent cite says it is a traditional state function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.861" offset="6043421">That is the Blye Case, but I emphasize and I was in involved in the Blye Case, I argued that for the Attorney General up in Albany.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.978" offset="6071842">That case involved a lien sale, simply liens not a lien sale involved in innkeeperâs lien which is a basically different type of lien than a warehousemanâs lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.171" offset="6136626">And finally and most importantly, the decision of the New York Court of Appeals simply does not control this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.632" offset="6178421">Even the cases that respondent cites, shows that you make an independent determination of case where there is a federal constitutional issue and once again, I would emphasize that the question of state action here is one of great importance because at the present time, you have a conflict in the circuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1704.211" offset="6896789">Before I commence my argument I would like to address the question of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.345" offset="6913298">Mrs. Jones claims that the $16,00.00 payment she made during the course of the litigation was not made voluntarily, but at least in part because of the threat of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.129" offset="6956452">She would have a claim for damages at least for a part of that $16,00.00 payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.874" offset="6979440">In addition, I closely point out to the Court that the defendants charged Mrs. Jones an auctioneerâs fee presumably for a schedule to sale and under the Code, in order for a person whose goods are stored to exercise a right of redemption, part of the cost which must be paid are the fees involved in the carrying out of the contemplated or actual sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.277" offset="7085079">I think this claim for damages is efficient to keep the case alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.781" offset="7103052">I would also point out that in all of these Consumer Due Process Cases which have been brought the last few years, there is virtually an inherent problem in mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.983" offset="7143907">We pointed this out to the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.393" offset="7153520">We prepared in appendix in the Circuit Court which listed the various cases and the status of the good during the litigation and it is inevitable that a threat of sale will not continue during an entire lengthy litigation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.727" offset="7214856">We brought this case at the time the threat of sale existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.184" offset="7228648">We submit that was as proper time to bring the case to try to stop the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.644" offset="7246516">The lawsuit served that purpose, but it is not reasonable to suppose that that threat will continue during the course of a three or four-year litigation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.971" offset="7287790">I would say that the capable of repetition yet evading review doctrine would also apply to these type of situation and I would also point that --</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.816" offset="14171159">In response to the respondentâs argument, early on there was mention of this and has been mentioned again, a stipulation about class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.782" offset="14223091">As it has been recognized by this Court, the Attorney General did not sign this and many other parties did not sign this so-called class action stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.376" offset="14269380">So, we are parties to this case so these other people, so it basically is inoperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.919" offset="14295607">Furthermore, and I think I should emphasize that the respondents seems to be saying that he wants the warehouseman to bring service summonsing complaint and bring a court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.918" offset="14347643">As has been pointed out I think in our brief of the petition of Flagg Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.166" offset="14368541">that brings into play when the sheriff goes out to execute the judgment lien, brings into play the question of the household goods exemption provided by New York State Statute and makes a world of problems which I do not have time to go into now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.590" offset="14434265">Now, I think once again, there is a claim here that there is not an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.577" offset="14474284">Well, the claim as I now hear it that there is no opportunity to be heard, he says he has no opportunity to be heard before the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.122" offset="14504377">Well that is questionable, but what I wish to emphasize to Your Honors is that the sale is not such a significant event.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.562" offset="14546173">The customer can be heard before the sale if he has a vigorous attorney and that he wants to be heard before the sale seeking an injunction of the like or he can be heard as he very frequently is after the sale claiming an action in conversion of the sale was not properly conducted and a like.</text>

            <text syncTime="3908.929" offset="15715623">Mr. Greenwald, what if the New York legislature decided that the Courts of New York were so congested that they just had to eliminate some claims for relief and they decided to eliminate any civil action for conversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.890" offset="15783437">Do you think that would implicate state actions so that someone who had previously had a claim for conversion could go into the District Court and say the state has taken away my client?</text>

            <text syncTime="3937.062" offset="15828159">No, because we actually had that case with our no fault law and I think it was appealed up to this Court where we under no fault insurance provision, we provided that any dispute about no fault, the benefits or the insurance is subject to binding arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.992" offset="15895868">It basically was taken out of the Courts of the State of New York because we do have a lot of congestion in our Courts and I think that is the example that is operative in that situation.</text>
