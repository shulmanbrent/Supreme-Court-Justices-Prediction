            <label>Mr. George B. Christensen</label>
            <text syncTime="118.464" offset="554356">The Court may recall that this is sort of a companion case to the White Motor case you decided recently involving the Minnesota Pension Protection Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.547" offset="602735">You there decided that to the ERISA of the subject of patent regulation was not preempted by the Federal Labor Laws and you did not touch any Constitutional issues.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="142.058" offset="648815">You said patent regulation, you mean pension?</text>

            <label>Mr. George B. Christensen</label>
            <text syncTime="144.872" offset="659995">Pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.502" offset="670548">I have been listening too much this morning, I am afraid.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.056" offset="692805">The same pension statute is before you in this case that you had before you in the White Motor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.577" offset="734810">In substance, what Minnesota did, anticipating that ERISA was coming which eventually would preempt the field, it passed this 10-year vesting provision that added to the substantive obligations of Allied Structural Steel’s pension plans thereby conferring an unexpected windfall on employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.210" offset="865422">It did this retroactively, in effect gave a retroactive wage increase because contributions to a pension plan are a form of compensation for the employee and as we try to demonstrate, and think we do in our reply brief in the face of no important or vital public need that would authorize such an intrusion into private contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.581" offset="986839">We take the position that if it is what was done here is not impermissible, if it is upheld, then the impairment of contract clause is virtually gone from the Constitution and there would be no limit upon what states could do in important business contracts whether they be leases, insurance policies, deeds, pension plans or whatnot, they could play havoc with them and destroy the stability in private arrangements that the Constitution is designed to procure.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.027" offset="1164681">You will find as you go through the briefs Your Honors that New Jersey had a somewhat similar notion a little before Minnesota and that is this Raybestos-Manhattan case that we refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.660" offset="1239182">There, they made a statute somewhat similar to this imposing, in effect vesting requirements long or much earlier than the plan provided for and they limited it to employers of 500 persons or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.542" offset="1338761">New Jersey has a statute that is not, I do not know whether it is common to many states that provides special legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.939" offset="1372302">The New Jersey Superior Court struck the statute down as unconstitutional, as special legislation under their New Jersey Statute and as denying equal protection of the laws under both the State and the Federal Constitution and that has been affirmed by an opinion that came out in late March or early April, I forget which is, yet unpublished, but is attached as an appendix to our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.531" offset="1518692">The State of Minnesota before Your Honor does not deny as I read their brief that this is a vital impairment of the contract and you cannot imagine a much greater one in our case because we represent a smaller employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.429" offset="1610225">There appears to be about $150,000.00 of additional burden imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.310" offset="1633735">You cannot tell precisely the amount until actuarial computations are made and in the White Motor case where far more people were involved, there was a difference of some $8 to $10 million beyond the funds that White had committed itself or had reserved to pay its terminated employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="413.006" offset="1732583">Mr. Christensen, I suppose in the strictly technical sense, there is not an impairment of contract in so far as Allied is concerned here in the sense that a contractual expectation that it had was taken away from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.544" offset="1806770">Very likely, the sense of the provision is involved, but do you not ordinary think of impairment of the obligation or contract as thinking you had a right to receive something under a contract and then the state says no, you do not have a right to receive it?</text>

            <text syncTime="450.032" offset="1880645">Well, I think the term has been expanded over the years by the Courts, but there is a very definite impairment Mr. Justice Rehnquist in the sense I believe you were talking about because Allied had a right to terminate this pension plan with no penalty and Minnesota said in effect, you cannot terminate this plan even though the contract gives you an unlimited right so to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.377" offset="2022019">You cannot terminate it unless you pay this ransom money into this state fund to buy annuities for these people.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.919" offset="2080220">You can say depriving us of our right to terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.975" offset="2096416">It is pretty much Mr. Chief Justice a matter of semantics, but here was a plan which prescribed how it should be funded.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.758" offset="2147616">It was funded according to actuarial principles and of course it assumed that not all of the employees would be present to receive pensions.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.609" offset="2210937">You think the state could if a company had no bargained for plan or no voluntary plan, you think a state statute could require the company to adopt a statutory type plan?</text>
            <text syncTime="549.503" offset="2278542">Suppose in the statute they had a formula, a pattern and they just required all companies to start putting their money into these funds?</text>

            <text syncTime="641.793" offset="2647704">It brought the plan in under a five-year implementation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.808" offset="2667766">It gave various options for vesting or it permitted you to abandon the pension plan entirely with no penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.852" offset="2711966">It is a very complicated statute and I do not mean to speak with great authority upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.221" offset="2733386">Now, if you go to whether a state could have as you first put it, have adopted a social security plan, I do not think I am prepared to answer that.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.337" offset="2881866">If you follow social security, a state would tax individuals and employers in some prescribed amount to build retirement payments at age 65 or with the permission of this Court now 70 whatever it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.586" offset="2966921">Now, that is quite a different problem, Mr. Justice.

            <text syncTime="1135.409" offset="4622143">First of all, the Minnesota Act applies in two situations, a planned termination by an employer and a plant closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.402" offset="4658192">This case involves the closing of a plant, not a plan termination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.153" offset="4705108">No Your Honor, the plan is still in effect as of this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.506" offset="4718588">It has been amended twice by the company to freeze the benefit levels and to freeze the ability of anyone to get into the plan in the future and the amounts have been vested with respect to the people covered by the plan prior to those amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.226" offset="4809494">Our position, Your Honors is, the heart of appellant’s argument is that the situation addressed by the Pension Act was a subject of a preenactment contract and that as applied Allied, the Act has changed those established contractual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.130" offset="4877099">To the contrary, our position is that there is no established contract between Allied and its Minnesota workers with respect to their earned interest in the pension benefits based upon the circumstance of a plant shutdown and further that the act is not retroactive in effect since no preenactment established contractual rights are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.900" offset="4964139">Now, I think this can be illustrated by examining the nature of the contractual relationships we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.832" offset="4987858">The creation of a pension plan constitutes an unilateral offer by the employer which is subject to the acceptance by the employee and that acceptance is only complete when he has satisfied both the length of service requirements and the attainment of the minimum age requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.107" offset="5317001">At the recess, the state was arguing about the contractual relationship involved in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.264" offset="5353572">I thought that a brief recitation of the procedural history relating to this point might be in order to help clarify the position before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.179" offset="5413236">The challenge was brought by Allied Steel in District Court to the application of the state statute here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.988" offset="5448449">As a result of that action, the state ultimately filed a motion for the Federal District Court to abstain in order that the State Courts could construe the null and void provision of the Act which is the final section of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.886" offset="5516054">At the same time, there was a cross motion for summary judgment brought by Allied Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.903" offset="5536116">In the context of that motion, we filed a brief in June of 1976 which stated that to the extent that the pension plan allowed Allied to cause a forfeiture of the accrued benefits for those not qualified under the plan, there might be impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.806" offset="5639770">Of course, subsequent to that brief, there was an argument before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.836" offset="5659936">The District Court denied both motions, certified instead of abstaining on the question of interpretation of state law, certified that to the Minnesota State Supreme Court appoint a Special Master to find fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.769" offset="5711659">The Special Master found as a finding of fact that the pension plan as originally adopted does not take into account a plant shutdown as one of the conditions for the actuarial calculations associated with those findings of fact were stipulated to by all the parties and in constitute findings of fact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.082" offset="5804863">So in any event, we think that there is before the Court, the issue of whether or not there is impairment to this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.911" offset="5836210">Now, the relevance of the impairment issue of course goes to the reasonableness test under the United States Trust and extent of impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.968" offset="5868393">Our point is that it is established that a pension plan constitutes a unilateral offer by the employer to the employee of the form of the differed compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.793" offset="5911757">The law is and the appellants have admitted that employer contributions constitute a form of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.198" offset="5941327">However, the cases have held that an employee is not entitled to receive that form of differed compensation or any part thereof unless he has satisfied the eligibility requirements to the plan and those eligibility requirements are typically the attainment of a minimum age and the service for a minimum period of time whatever it might be under the particular plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.848" offset="6031920">Consequently in such a situation, we submit that if there is no contract for the employees benefit to have enforced in this situation, there can be none to be impaired.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.732" offset="6947459">The express language of the pension plan itself indicates that there was no meaning in the minds on the plant shutdown situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.140" offset="6981105">For example, the length of service for vesting under the pension plan is a lengthy period of time, 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.086" offset="7004929">Secondly, there is an expressed covenant not to compete in the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.789" offset="7019662">It seems to use that this implies that the person reading that document could anticipate that the plan would continue in existence and the plan would continue in operation for at least the minimum period of vesting, 20 years plus the lengthy period of time thereafter since retirees would forfeit their benefits if they engaged in competition with the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.694" offset="7099283">That presumes a continuing enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.231" offset="7109523">We note the Court below took special notice of the fact that the companies actuaries did not take into account the plant shutdown and Judge Haney noted that the argument on the merits that in light of that fact, there is a question as to whether you really have an impairment of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.690" offset="7167306">Now, the Act is also not retroactive in our opinion because it applies to transactions which are completed after its day of enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.472" offset="7426441">The only relevance of the question of whether or not there is impairment would go to the degree of impairment analysis under the contract clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.841" offset="7459877">Now, we do not quarrel that the results of the statute has been to change the overall employment agreements involving these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.792" offset="7495717">The Court below in a footnote I think at page 890 of the appendix noted that employment agreement includes the wage agreement, the pension plan, and any other fringed benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.579" offset="7534901">Now, our understanding is that the contract clause issue raised by the appellants relate solely to the pension plan and in the context of that argument I think our point that there is really no contract there is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.788" offset="7579727">However, if the Court is going to view the entire employment agreement as a contract then I think these arguments are relevant to the matter before the Court as are the retroactivity arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.836" offset="7647855">Our position is also that the Act is not retroactive because there is no change in the benefit levels provided by the plan, and therefore, it does not impair the contract itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.820" offset="7691845">As a general matter, the Act is tied to the specific benefit levels that are provided by the plan to which it applies.

            <text syncTime="1919.768" offset="7759659">If you look at the termination article of that pension plan, it states that if when the plan is terminated all covered employees have a right to their earned interest in their pension plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.385" offset="10666042">I have just heard counsel I think say that a minimum wage made two years retroactive would be unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.888" offset="10780145">He certainly, the one thing we appear to be in agreement on is that contributions to a pension plan are a form of compensation, a form of wage, and there can be no doubt whatsoever that retroactive wages are required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.916" offset="10864259">Now, I could go on and argue, but I do not think I could make the matter any clearer than I have with that blunt assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.680" offset="10899263">I would like if I might to talk about the line of distinction that counsel would draw between bargain plans and unbargained plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.213" offset="10961435">These contracts, it seems to us are as binding upon the employer as a one bargained out with a labor union and so long as that plan was in effect and about this there can be no doubt, if the company failed to make the required contributions to it each year, the employer could be sued by all or any of these employees, they were a condition of this contract of labor or employment.</text>
