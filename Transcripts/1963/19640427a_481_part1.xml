            <label>Mr. Edward Bennett Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="36.532" offset="249501">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.031" offset="271548">The case at bar is a civil antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.786" offset="298506">It's here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which affirmed the judgment of the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.241" offset="348348">The trial judge, if the Court please, had directed a verdict for the defendants at the conclusion of the plaintiff's case thereby taking the case away from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.711" offset="414177">With the Court's indulgence and for convenience of identification, I shall refer to the petitioner, if I may, as the plaintiff and the respondents as the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.602" offset="465795">The plaintiff in the court below was an exhibitor of motion pictures, first run motion pictures in the City of Philadelphia, the Viking Theatre Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.911" offset="527026">The defendants, if the Court please, were the seven major distributors of motion pictures in the United States, Paramount, Warner Brothers, Columbia, Universal, MGM, United Artist, and Twentieth Century-Fox and three chain exhibitors which operated first run houses in the City of Philadelphia, William Goldman Theatres, which operated the Midtown, the Randolph and the Goldman Theaters, Stanley-Warner, which operated the Mastbaum, the Stanley and the Stanton and Fox Philadelphia Building, Incorporated, an affiliate of the National Theaters Chain which operated the Fox Theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.258" offset="736423">There were some other very small independent exhibitors in the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.981" offset="759306">The Arcadia and the Trans-Lux, each of which had theaters with seating capacity around 650, in the case of the Trans-Lux, 493 and two other theaters, the Studio and the World, which although included by the defendants as first run Philadelphia houses, actually showed only six first run films during the 123-week period involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.649" offset="885948">They usually showed reissues or art films.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.079" offset="903711">The thrust of the complaint below was that the defendants and each of them were engaged in a conspiracy violative of the federal antitrust laws injurious to the plaintiff from July 2nd, 1954 to November 12 of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.303" offset="1004544">The defendant exhibitors, if the Court please, dominated the Philadelphia first run exhibition business, as the record shows, controlling 83% of all seats available for first run motion picture exhibition in the City of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.989" offset="1083329">Now, the issue in the case, as presented to this Court, is whether or not the plaintiff made a prima facie case entitling him to have this case decided by the jury, whether or not a jury of reasonable men from the evidence in the record could have concluded a violation of the antitrust laws an injury to this plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.403" offset="1184998">It's axiomatic that on an issue of this kind, all reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of the party plaintiff and adverse to the parties than officiary to the directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.635" offset="1237870">It's my purpose, if the Court please, in the time that's allotted to me, to cut through the mulish of economic (Inaudible) this record and point out to this Court that there is clear, direct evidence of an agreement and an unlawful agreement to which each of the parties, defendant in this case, were parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.760" offset="1342464">I think it's -- it's not an overstatement to say that this case is almost unique in the long annals of motion picture antitrust litigation because we are here not relying on -- on inferences from conduct or on conscious parallelism of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.407" offset="1432952">We're here saying, if the Court please, that there is in this record direct evidence of an agreement that is unlawful per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.629" offset="1473912">And secondly, while the end object of this agreement was economic homicide for this plaintiff, it was not direct sudden homicide of a readily demonstrable nature but rather a slow lingering type induced by creeping pellagra caused by a carefully planned dietary deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.829" offset="1594702">Now, I'd like, in the first instance, to touch upon the evidence in the record of the agreement among the defendants, it's unlawfulness, how it worked in theory and what's its purpose was and then point out to the Court an invidious refinement of this agreement known as the Schwalberg agreement and then showed to the Court from the record how the agreement worked in operation vis-à-vis the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.503" offset="1741406">Before the Viking Theatre came into the Philadelphia market for first run motion picture exhibition, the Stanley-Warner Chain had five first run theatres in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.836" offset="1806712">Goldman had three, Fox, one.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.955" offset="1823222">Stanley-Warner converted its Boyd Theatre from a first run theatre into a Cinerama house, selling reserved seats, thereby taking it out of the first run motion picture exhibition business.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.322" offset="1880691">It then closed its Alden Theatre, bringing about a position of perfect parody between IT and Goldman, each then had three first run houses in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.726" offset="1934294">Fox had one.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.995" offset="1943385">At this point, an agreement was entered into and this is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.109" offset="1963760">There is no dispute from the defendants concerning this.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.354" offset="1980792">An agreement was entered into between Stanley-Warner and Goldman that they would not compete against each other for acquisition of film from the distributors that they would draw a list.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.283" offset="2044531">On one side of the list would be pictures allocated to Goldman, on the other side of the list would be pictures allocated to Stanley-Warner.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.796" offset="2078595">Sometimes a list would be drawn by Goldman in which case Stanley-Warner had its first pick and sometimes, the list would be drawn by Stanley-Warner in which case Goldman would have his first pick and in some instances, the lists were drawn by the distributors because in this -- in this agreement, the distributors acquiesced.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.976" offset="3195277">Now, Viking came into operation this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.986" offset="3211368">When the Alden Theatre was closed by Stanley-Warner bringing it into perfect position of parity with Goldman, Mr. Harry Sley of Philadelphia, the President of the Viking Corporation, purchased the Alden Theatre.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.798" offset="3278555">As soon as he manifested an intension to operate it as a theatre, immediately, Stanley-Warner undertook negotiations to buy it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.344" offset="3316799">However, the record shows that he spent some $600,000 refurbishing it and making it into one of the finest theatres in the City of Philadelphia for first run motion picture exhibition, and then notified each of the distributors that he intended to compete for film in the Philadelphia market and to operate it as a first run house.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.974" offset="3399241">So when Viking came into business on July 2nd of 1954, it entered into a split market.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.653" offset="3417945">It entered into a market wherein certain films were split on the Goldman side, certain on Stanley-Warner and the Twentieth Century-Fox Films were reserved for the Fox Theatre.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.041" offset="3475519">So Viking immediately found that every time it came into the market for a picture, it was in a competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.836" offset="3514702">It had to compete against one of the major exhibitors for film, whereas when Viking got a film and was committed for a period of weeks to play it, the other defendant exhibitors enjoyed a competitive low in the Philadelphia market and were able to get their pictures without competition from Viking.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.382" offset="3592861">So, a vicious cycle set in.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.941" offset="3611146">The higher that Viking bid and the longer the playing commitments that it made, the longer the competitive low it made in the -- in the market in the City of Philadelphia inuring to the advantage of the defendant exhibitors so that they could get stronger while Viking grew weaker to use a homely analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.634" offset="3693902">Assume that here, in the City of Washington, we had three retailers of coal, A, B and C, A with three large storage bins, B with three large storage bins and C with one storage bin.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.928" offset="3763075">A and B entered into an agreement that they won't compete against each other in buying coal from the wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.219" offset="3788257">Now, what does this mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="922.222" offset="3792227">It means that every time C goes into the market to buy coal from a wholesaler for its bin, it's got to compete against A or B.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.358" offset="3904763">And whereas C must pay competitive prices, let's assume $20 a ton, when it fills its bin, A and B, during the period when C is filled, can buy their coal at noncompetitive prices, say $15 a ton, and if the retail price is $20 a ton, with the expiration of the year, you can see that C is constantly buying its coal at $20 a ton, selling it at $20 a ton and you have economic ruin at the end of the year whereas A and B can survive because they have periods when they can buy their coal at noncompetitive prices and sell it at a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.331" offset="4052720">This split agreement, if the Court please, is nothing more than a very, very thinly veiled device to circumvent the pronouncements of this Court made four times with respect to pooling agreements for purchasing film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.750" offset="4114369">The first time it was made -- it was made in the Crescent Amusement case, United States against Crescent Amusement Company in 1944 where the Court struck down an agreement whereby a number of exhibitors vended together and designated a common purchasing agent to acquire film from the distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.165" offset="4200051">And the Court struck it down because they were ally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.384" offset="4216874">They had coerced all of their economic power into one market, allied against the -- the nonmember exhibitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.406" offset="4244982">Again, it spoke in United States against Griffith in 1948 against these pooling agreements among exhibitors for the purchase of film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.645" offset="4281971">It spoke again in 1948 in Shine -- Schine Theatre against the United States and finally in the Paramount case in 1948, it said that these pooling agreements were illegal because they used the language of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.656" offset="4365981">They have the effect of nullifying competition between the allied theatres and of making more effective the competition of the group against theatres not members of the pool.</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.281" offset="5260518">So, if the Court please, we have here a classic division of the market case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.023" offset="5291447">We have the Philadelphia market divided into submarkets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.954" offset="5307225">We have each of them -- defendant exhibitors coercing their total economic power, their market power into a submarket against wholly unequal independent exhibitors without any competition from the other nearly equal or coequal chain exhibitors in the City of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.102" offset="5395832">Now, that is just precisely the kind of thing which the Attorney General's National Antitrust Advisory Committee spoke out against several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.148" offset="5435956">And they said the contracting parties to such a market division gained only if the result is to give each a substantial degree of power in his own market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.792" offset="5478588">There is no doubt either as a matter of principle or precedent that agreements among competitors for market division should be and are treated like price arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.240" offset="5520384">Now, when you add this fact to it, if the Court please, here, these three party exhibitors had films from which no competition would emanate from the other party defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.566" offset="5593631">You'll add this fact that sometimes they got film on their side of the split which they really didn't even want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.886" offset="5626964">But what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.103" offset="5631770">Notwithstanding that fact, they still bid on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.161" offset="5643995">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.535" offset="5645563">Because when they bid on it, they drove Viking up in order to get pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.758" offset="5662386">They drove up the small independents' -- the small independents' advice even though they didn't want the picture itself and if the Court would look at page 102 of the record, you -- you have that testimony quite clear from Mr. Fabian of Stanley-Warner who said, "Some of the pictures we never even wanted after they were split.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.003" offset="5755382">They weren't suitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.084" offset="5763741">But then the other exhibitor in the territory wanted the picture, we would be as a rule for us to bid against it," notwithstanding the fact that they didn't want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.502" offset="5801357">Now, if the Court please, this is the way the split arrangement operated vis-à-vis Viking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.884" offset="5834898">But in addition to the split of product, in addition to the split of product in the Philadelphia area, there was, as I indicated earlier, an invidious refinement of this split agreement called the Schwalberg agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.846" offset="5902712">Now, with respect to the Schwalberg agreement, not even the defendants are audacious enough to defend its legality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.701" offset="5942209">But they adopt a sort of evidentiary myopia with respect to it and say that there is no evidence in the record that it was operative, that it actually was put into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.191" offset="5992155">And I'd like now to address the Court's attention to the Schwalberg agreement, what it was and how it operated and show that it did in fact operate and there was evidence in this record that it operated across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.965" offset="6047222">First of all, volume 6 of the record, plaintiff's Exhibit Number 8 at page 2393, we have a letter from the Vice President of Paramount to the President of Paramount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.344" offset="6140740">This is an exhibit in evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.267" offset="6152443">"Dear George, the so-called Schwalberg agreement, with Goldman of Philadelphia, envisaged an equal division qualitatively and quantitatively of our product between Goldman and Stanley-Warner in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.150" offset="6224018">Under this arrangement, bids were invited from Stanley-Warner and Goldman as well as other theatres in Philadelphia requesting a bid invitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.933" offset="6259127">If any bid was acceptable, the acceptance closes the sales file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.412" offset="6276995">If no bid was acceptable, Paramount agreed to negotiate with either Stanley-Warner or Goldman governed by whether the individual picture was on Goldman's or Stanley-Warner's split.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.813" offset="6322657">My understanding is that we were not permitted if all bids were rejected to negotiate with the unsuccessful bidders or any other theatre that did not offer a bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.136" offset="6359960">We were obligated upon rejection of all bids to negotiate with one of the other and I'm told that in one or more cases, the negotiated deal was reviewed or adjusted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.095" offset="6615751">He said, however, if we found that bids received did not measure up to our national policy of what we thought of the picture and we wanted to come back to him and he negotiated a deal and that deal was equal to or better than national policy, he didn't want Paramount to take that bid and go across the street and try to better it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.896" offset="7215000">This is dated December 12, 1955, and he says, "Dear Bill, at our conference at the hotel plaza last Thursday in which Harry Calman and Louis Phillips were also present, you turn to me and said, "George, let's forget, there ever was an agreement between Paramount and me made with Al Schwalberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.443" offset="7305174">I won't ever hold Paramount to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.005" offset="7339342">And then the -- the letter writer, Mr. Weltner goes on to say, "If this is not accurate word for word, it isn't substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.198" offset="7380198">I express my appreciation and stated that we wanted you as a customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.659" offset="7397961">We then try to work out a formula that would be mutually satisfactory and practical and yet would not put us in a position where anyone could rightly claim that we favored you and discriminated against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.520" offset="7445504">At this meeting, we could not come up with such a formula, one that was satisfactory to you."</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.943" offset="7471104">Now, consider the Schwalberg agreement for a moment, in the light of the fact, that Goldman wouldn't bid on motion pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.775" offset="7530454">There are about 250 pictures that were released in the Philadelphia area as shown by plaintiff's Exhibit 1, the splits, the first -- very first part of volume 6, which were earmarked for Goldman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.613" offset="7585834">Stanley-Warner couldn't bid on him because of its agreement, Fox couldn't bid on him because of its agreement and Goldman wouldn't bid on him because Goldman wouldn't bid and this record is ramped with statements from Goldman that he wouldn't bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.332" offset="7652707">For example with plaintiff's Exhibit Number 5 in this record, on one occasion when Goldman made a bid, he was so upset that the fact didn't broke his policy, he never did a bid but he wrote a letter to Paramount's lawyers and he said, "This doesn't set any precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.766" offset="7714461">As you know, we take the position we are not to bid on any pictures but only to negotiate for them."</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.414" offset="7741001">So what happened with respect to those 250 pictures?</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.954" offset="7755212">When the distributor came in to the Philadelphia market with pictures that run the Goldman side of the split, he couldn't get a bid from Stanley-Warner, he couldn't get a bid from Fox and he couldn't get one from Goldman because Goldman wouldn't bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.150" offset="7804008">So he got one from Viking or Trans-Lux or Arcadia but obviously, he wanted to negotiate with the top chain exhibitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.633" offset="7833893">He then go over to Goldman and talk to Goldman about the picture and under the Schwalberg agreement, if Goldman made him an offer, he couldn't take the offer across the street to Viking and give Viking a chance to need it because --</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.688" offset="8362088">The record is very clear on this, Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.089" offset="8375777">We've heard a lot of talk about -- well, we asked you in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.788" offset="8398555">Why didn't you come in?</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.724" offset="8402317">Well, first of all, the record at pages 974 and 975 show very -- shows very clearly that Viking was not invited into this split until after its lawyers wrote letters to these distributors and these other exhibitors in 1956, then they were asked after they'd been victimized by an illegal split over a period of two years, then they were invited to join the gang.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.543" offset="8517569">But the fact of the matter is, of course, there were certainly no obligation on them to join something that was per se illegal with respect to the small independent exhibitors and it's been our position from the beginning that this is a per se illegal violative agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.741" offset="8590294">Now, Your Honor, if the Court please, I said that I would show you this -- this split in operation and some of the sham bidding that went on under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.367" offset="8644838">First of all, Goldman, at page 1661 of the record, conceded that he had an arrangement similar to that, that he had with Paramount in effect with Warner Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.942" offset="8707114">But let's look at Warner Brothers and see the Schwalberg agreement and operation insofar as that distributor was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.500" offset="8745357">A typical illustration, there was a picture called a McConnell Story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.791" offset="8766568">On July 15, Viking was invited to bid for that picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.361" offset="8788825">It did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.469" offset="8793213">In July 19, 1955, it received a letter from Warner Brothers saying, "We've given the picture to Goldman."</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.898" offset="8826964">Now, four -- that was four days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.307" offset="8836577">Now, at the trial, Mr. Mansell of Warner Brothers said, "Well, we gave that picture to Goldman because we wanted the picture shown in Philadelphia over Labor Day and we want it on August 25 opening day."</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.298" offset="8896554">And Viking was committed until September 9th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.228" offset="8908257">But where did the picture go?</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.718" offset="8914213">The picture went to the Goldman Randolph Theatre which at that time, was committed to show a picture until the 29th day of September.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.372" offset="8944828">Now, what did Mr. Mansell say at the trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.804" offset="8954546">Mr. Mansell said, "Well, I didn't make the decision to give to Goldman until mid-August."</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.921" offset="8975026">But the record shows that he wrote a letter to Viking on the 19th day of July saying, "Too bad, it's not yours, it's Goldman's."</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.001" offset="9007417">Mr. Justice Stewart, an illustration of the sham bidding that went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.903" offset="9026957">If -- if you'll look at plaintiff's Exhibit Number 53, which is in volume 6 at page 2465, you'll see a very dramatic illustration of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.123" offset="9111907">Plaintiff's Exhibit 53 is a contract between Universal and the Mastbaum Theatre.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.384" offset="9144926">It gives the Mastbaum Theatre a picture called the Helen Beck and it provides that Helen Beck will start after Mr. Roberts finishes at the Mastbaum Theatre.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.761" offset="9198425">When was that contract entered into?</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.172" offset="9208038">On May 19th of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.087" offset="9231757">What happened then?</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.277" offset="9240430">The exhibit immediately before it, plaintiff's Exhibit 52, Warner Brothers invited Viking to bid on Mr. Roberts on May 23rd, the picture has already been awarded on May 19th to the Mastbaum Theatre as evidenced by the contract plaintiff's Exhibit 53 and that's an illustration of the sham bidding that went on in the Philadelphia market during this 123-week period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.548" offset="9345546">Now, with respect to the picture Serenade in Pete Kelly's Blues, Viking bid, bid is rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.132" offset="9371878">Never a chance was given to Viking to negotiate after the bids, the pictures went to the Goldman Theatre in precise accord with the Schwalberg agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2361.596" offset="9549720">Now, look again at the United Artist to see the Schwalberg agreement in -- in operation with respect to them.</text>
