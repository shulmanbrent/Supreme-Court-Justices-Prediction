            <text syncTime="18.584" offset="177716">Mr. Redfield is going to deal with the legal questions primarily and I will relate the circumstances under which the case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.762" offset="226408">This is an appeal from a summary contempt conviction of a witness at a criminal trial in the city of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.172" offset="272071">The conviction took place sometime after the conclusion of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.250" offset="300387">The trial itself was that of former Borough President of Manhattan, Hulan Jack.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.650" offset="333928">Mr. Jack was charged with conspiracy and this witness, appellant here, was named as a coconspirator, but was not indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.160" offset="388054">The charge was generally that Mr. Jack had received favors from persons who might have benefited in connection with official duties performed by Mr. Jack.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.001" offset="455346">One of those charges involved this appellant although Mr. Jack was ultimately acquitted of that particular charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.287" offset="496515">Appellant, a lawyer and engaged in real estate business ventures had for many years been an intimate personal friend of Mr. Jack's and a close political associate.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.306" offset="556596">He was convinced of Mr. Jack's innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.862" offset="582823">He was called by the prosecution after having testified at length before the grand jury and during the first trial, because the first trial resulted in a disagreement and this occurrence which is the subject of this appeal was at the second trial, during the first trial differences arose between Mr. Ungar as a witness and the prosecuting attorney Mr. Scotti and the Judge and I might note parenthetically that Mr. Scotti and the Judge had been close associates in the district attorney's office before the judge ascended the bench and as a result Mr. Ungar was treated as a hostile witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.482" offset="785324">It also developed during the first trial that the defendant's attorney Mr. Baker --</text>

            <text syncTime="192.598" offset="873723">He then sought to withdraw that immunity unsuccessfully.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.702" offset="966196">I am just asking about your statement that they treated him as a hostile witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.455" offset="1065148">During the interval between the first and the second trials, Mr. Ungar addressed first a letter and then a motion to the Trial Judge who was the same at both trials asking that he be treated as the court's witness because he said he had experienced difficulty during the first trial in giving his understanding of the fact and felt that he was whipsawed between the prosecutor and the defense attorney, the defense attorney apparently taking to position that Mr. Jack's difficulties stemmed from his connection with appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.275" offset="1248423">That request was turned down and the second trial commenced and Mr. Ungar was a witness for several days and further difficulties –</text>

            <text syncTime="297.056" offset="1291577">The prosecution, this is all -- he was called both times only by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.627" offset="1321880">Certain other difficulties arose primarily because Mr. Ungar wanted to give fuller versions of conversations which had occurred between him and Mr. Jack that apparently the prosecutor was interested in developing.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.241" offset="1384364">It reached a point on the third or fourth day of this testimony when Mr. Ungar became emotionally disturbed and asked the court to be allowed to step down for a brief time because he said he was so upset that he couldn't continue to give testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.757" offset="1474435">That request was repeated two or three times and each time denied and then came the outburst which is the basis of the contempt charge, which I suppose must be stated verbatim and again asking to be excused, the Judge having denied it before, Mr. Ungar continued and in the disturbed state to say, I am absolutely unfit to testify because of Your Honor's attitude and conduct toward me.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.494" offset="1649351">I'm being coerced and intimated and badgered, the court is suppressing the evidence and then followed a very, very unusual situation, the defense attorney –</text>

            <text syncTime="406.523" offset="1729494">The defense attorney then suggested that perhaps Mr. Ungar should be examined by a physician to find out whether he was emotionally upset or whether he was malingering and the court volunteered the statement that this was malingering of the worst kind I have ever seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.080" offset="1807653">And then the court retired to consider whether or not to act on the defense attorney's application and the jury was excused and Mr. Ungar remained seated in the witness stand for some little time.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.385" offset="1864913">The Judge came back and said he hadn't been able to make up his mind and then a few more minutes elapsed and finally the Judge said, well we might as well all go to lunch without ruling on the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.867" offset="1914859">During the lunch period Mr. Ungar went to nearby hospital and received medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.641" offset="1941922">He returned at the end of the lunch period.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.833" offset="1958745">The Judge then announced after being reminded by the defense attorney that his application had not been passed on and it was denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.042" offset="2091551">Now I wish to also point out that the Judge had on one or two occasions had monished Mr. Ungar and that at the end of the trial he told Mr. Ungar to stay around.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.405" offset="2152991">The trial ended late in November and on the Thursday following around 4:30 in the afternoon Mr. Ungar was served with fairly luminous papers requiring his appearance before the Judge on the following Tuesday morning charging him with contempt, reciting a number of incidents which had occurred during the trial, but specifying primarily the matter to which I alluded and which I quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.304" offset="2332609">Mr. Ungar appeared in court on Tuesday with the clerk of a lawyer whom he had in the meantime retained, but who was however engaged in a trial in another part of the court, asking for a brief adjournment so that this lawyer could prepare and represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.137" offset="2439920">The Judge required that the lawyer himself appear and the lawyer was able to arrange with the Judge in the other part for a short adjournment of an hour or two of his case and came before the respondent here asking for an adjournment so that he could prepare.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.298" offset="2580564">I was also going to note because it is in the record that the judge made some emphasis upon it, that at the time when Mr. Ungar retained this lawyer, the lawyer told him that he was engaged and that he would hope to get an adjournment so that he could represent Mr. Ungar.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.564" offset="2661648">I should also add that in addition to this being over a weekend, the Monday preceding the Tuesday appearance in court was the day of one of the heaviest snowfalls of recent years when New York was practically incapacitated, the courts closed, the schools closed, nothing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.314" offset="2748583">The judge after listening to the lawyer for some few moments, several pages of the record in any case, denied the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.718" offset="2794245">The judge then proceeded to introduce into evidence stenographic minutes, various things that had occurred, enquired of respondent whether he wanted to go on and respondent said that he felt helpless and did however make some comments upon the situation including an apology and protested against the judge proceeding in the manner in which he had proceeded, contempt adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="827.009" offset="3411362">In any case thereupon under New York law, the apparently appropriate way to review a conviction of this sort is not by an appeal, but by what we call there an Article 78 proceeding which is an amalgam of the former mandamus certiorari and probation procedures, because the appeal that was taken is dismissed and the other was referred on it's merits and affirmed, then it ultimately went to the Court of Appeals in New York, the appellate division having affirmed without any opinion and the Court of Appeals likewise affirmed without any opinion, but in it's order of affordance made the rather remarkable statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.898" offset="3602996">However, we point out, that's at 156, that where the alleged contempt consists of the making of charges of wrong doing by the trial judge himself, he should where disposition of the contempt charge can be withheld until after the trial and where it is otherwise practicable or to the contempt proceeding to be tried before a different judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.368" offset="4320841">Now we contend three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.221" offset="4352293">First an attack upon the statute permitting summary proceedings where the circumstances do not require it, particularly where the proceedings occur after the expiration of the trial itself, so that the trial judge felt no necessity for immediate action because of the character of the contempt charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.913" offset="4475068">Obviously there are situations in which the contempt charge is such a character that immediate action must be taken as if a person starts a disturbance, a physical disturbance in a courtroom and can be physically removed and immediately punished and various other circumstances of that sort which are not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.874" offset="4554898">Now, that point will be elaborated by Mr. Redfield.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.620" offset="4573811">Yes, he was a lawyer, but primarily at that time engaged in real estate, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.697" offset="4594186">He had been a lawyer since 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.572" offset="4613622">The second question then is a propriety of the matter coming up before the same judge which requires a review of the relationship between the parties, the extent to which hostility had arisen during the course of the first, as well as the second trial between the trial judge and the witness and the extent to which the specific remarks constituted a reflection upon the trial judge and whether or not therefore there is a substantial basis for the rather unusual departure by the Court of Appeals from it's ordinary practice of merely certifying questions and indicating this judgment about the character of the remarks, and Mr. Redfield will also deal with that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.597" offset="4833782">Finally, there is the point which I want to stress for a moment a little further that in the light of all of these circumstances it was a denial of due process to refuse an adjournment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.981" offset="4899297">Here was no situation of urgency of any kind whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.021" offset="4919463">The trial had ended several weeks before the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.888" offset="4930957">The judge himself had taken rather the district attorney's office I believe at the Judge's request had taken some eight days to prepare the charges which were fairly voluminous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.756" offset="4998353">The papers were served on the eve of a weekend with little time for preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.664" offset="5038059">The difficulties of obtaining counsel in such a situation are of course well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.385" offset="5072959">Lawyers dislike appearing against Judges and there was no reason as obtainable to anybody, why when this request for adjournment was made it could not have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.022" offset="5135444">Nothing would have been interfered with except perhaps the Judge's own feelings, which merely underlined the impropriety of that particular Judge, sitting there and passing on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.262" offset="5224469">It isn't as though this were a situation where there had been long delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.962" offset="5255189">It isn't even a situation where there were any witnesses that had to be called who would not be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.021" offset="5279431">There was nothing, just absolutely nothing in the situation as it then existed that would justify a reasonable request for an adjournment. There wasn't even an opportunity under the particular circumstances here existing for appellant to have filed a written answer to this rather long petition which was served on him and no written -- and so why -- isn't the record inconsequence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.346" offset="5416730">There was no opportunity, really -- real opportunity for him to consult with counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.403" offset="5440972">He wanted an opportunity to explore the situation which existed and possibility of medical evidence to support his contention with regard to his disturbed state of mind on that occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.628" offset="5497919">In any event one can only, it seems to me characterize, the Judge's refusal to grant this request for adjournment as a fully arbitrary judicial act, and therefore, a clear denial of due process because basic, aside from all other considerations which have developed in the law of due process, basic is the right of a person to have a reasonable opportunity to defend himself and we submit that no such opportunity was granted here and that -- therefore regardless of all other considerations, this conviction cannot be supported.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.967" offset="5871261">He apparently felt that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.567" offset="5877635">He had sensed so in the papers, which were here in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.185" offset="5892159">Now whether he was justified in that whether a less, a person of perhaps less optimistic frame of mind might not have done something immediately, I submit is not the issue here because even if Mr. Ungar had known that he was going to be charged, he couldn't know until the papers were served on him exactly with what he was going to be charged because there had been two or three earlier instances in which the Judge had objected to Mr. Ungar's manner of testifying and issued some sort of veiled warning even then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.005" offset="6047431">And in any case until he got the papers he was not really in a position, I would suppose, to consult a lawyer to find out how you should handle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.825" offset="6086719">He by that time I suspect must have realized that like many lawyers he made a bad witness, those lawyers do the tradition is and this has been my own personal experience and he felt when he saw these papers that he needed help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.592" offset="6145755">But even if he had -- should have -- sought help sooner, I still say that the circumstances were such as not to justify the denial of an adjournment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.120" offset="12827878">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.102" offset="12839790">As a practicing lawyer and particularly as a prosecutor, I sometimes wish that our Constitution were not still so full of mysteries and surprises, but I think that we do have a right to rely on certain interpretations of this Court dealing with questions in the recent past similar to one in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.357" offset="12920769">Here we have a Judge who sat during two trials of an extremely difficult and sensitive case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.970" offset="12951280">One in which emotions were high, one in which public attention was focused upon the courtroom with great intensity, sat and dealt with a witness who was avowedly a close personal friend of the defendant on trial and yet whose testimony was essential to the prosecution of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.569" offset="13029648">These two men were named as coconspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.258" offset="13044381">The conspiracy was such that it was necessarily one which was carried out in secret and the coconspirator was therefore an essential and necessary witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.206" offset="13088162">It was indeed in order to obtain his testimony against the then Borough President of New York that he was accorded immunity from prosecution in the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.894" offset="13126928">Nonetheless, he maintained throughout the first trial, and throughout his testimony in the second trial, an attitude inconsistent with that of a witness in a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.314" offset="13172590">He was avowedly interested in securing an acquittal for his friend, the defendant on trial, and not avowedly but quite evidently from his tactics equally concerned with a securing if he could in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.959" offset="13235179">His testimony throughout both trials is replete with instances of evasion or purposeful of failures of recollection, if I can term them such. There is no question about the fact that he saw his role as alternate attorney for the defendant against whom he was purportedly testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.508" offset="13333400">As a matter of fact there's an exchange in the record itself to that effect where he was asked, you realize of course Mr. Ungar that the defendant here is represented by counsel of his own and Mr. Ungar responded to that, no I do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.335" offset="13396720">Faced with this dilemma, the Court in an effort to be completely fair not only to this difficult witness but perhaps more importantly to the defendant there on trial still might to lead to confine the witness's answer to the proper conduct of a witness at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.077" offset="13471640">Time and again he instructed him both in chambers privately, and while he was on the stand that he was to answer questions, that he was not to volunteer information, that he was not to offer objections to questions that he was asked, and that he was not to comment on whether or not those questions were fair and proper questions, but the defendant was represented by an attorney who could both bring out during the normal process of cross examination and a thing that might have been omitted on the direct examination or object to questions that were improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.875" offset="13594833">Nonetheless he persisted in this course of action until it came to the point where he was asked a question of vital and central significance in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.590" offset="13637778">He was asked what Mr. Jack said when he, Sidney Ungar, had told him that there was a full scale grand jury investigation in progress concerning this alleged conflict of interest and a high city official.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.994" offset="13703398">Now of course there was a charge here of conspiring to obstruct justice and to prevent the grand jury in its investigation from learning the truth about these transactions and so it's literally apparent that this question was perhaps the most crucial question at the trial and I think Mr. Ungar realized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.298" offset="13772570">His answer to that question I think can be fairly characterized as nothing short of equivocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.435" offset="13797125">He said that was part of a conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.050" offset="13811545">He said I cannot answer the question in that form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.394" offset="13828995">When the court and I think quite properly as, as after all the man who was charged with responsibility of maintaining an orderly trail on the issues told Mr. Ungar to answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.815" offset="13882598">Mr. Ungar turned to him and as the mandate recites in a loud and insolent and disorderly manner shouted this phrase which has been repeated here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.647" offset="13957935">At that point instantly the Court said to him, you are contemptuous and you are also disorderly and insolent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.908" offset="13990954">Nonetheless, nonetheless the Court deferred action and indicated that it was to defer action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.247" offset="14024391">Now in doing so the court was mindful of a not too ancient decision of this Court in People against -- in Sacher against United States in which divert procedure had been sanctioned by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.765" offset="14098474">The deferred exercise of a power, it was held, is not to extinguish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.702" offset="14126164">To delay the administration of an acknowledged power is not to evaporate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.965" offset="14155212">Now I do think that we can start someway here and I think perhaps that proper place to start is that a Court does enjoy the inherent power to punish instantly and by an abbreviated procedure a person who is contemptuous and disorderly in its presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.702" offset="14230131">This statute is not vague in defining the crime, this statute adds the additional element which is not present in the federal law that the conduct must tend directly to interrupt the proceedings of the Court or to detract from the dignity normally accorded to a Court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.267" offset="14304423">Proceeding under this statute, the Court, I think we must acknowledge, could have instantly punished Sidney Ungar for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.100" offset="14335770">As a matter of fact Sidney Ungar who was not only an attorney in the State of New York but a very articulate attorney as evidenced by this record itself acknowledged to the Court at the time of the proceedings which are here being reviewed that the Court could have punished him instantly at the time of his utterance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.872" offset="14418840">The real question then is whether or not this power which the Court enjoyed at that time was lost by the action of the Court in deferring its exercise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3619.172" offset="14580067">Nonetheless recalling the Sacher case once again, it was their help and I think with some reason, that the power itself is not based upon the necessity for immediacy only.</text>

            <text syncTime="4463.278" offset="17956446">When we say that the right to confront, to cross examine, to have an adjournment, to have an attorney are such valued things in this system of law and justice which we are all so proud of, I think that we are looking at them not as ends in themselves but rather as means to assure a fair result and I think that where there are alternate means then there is a second and adequate justification for the imposition of the power of summary contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="4513.231" offset="18156335">Now, this I do not contend that this was an adjudication of contempt, but I think it is a far clearer indication of the serious manner in which the Court viewed that out burst and perhaps a notice at least of a sort as to what was to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.367" offset="18216835">I think that the effectiveness of that immediate statement itself provides some justification for summary contempt powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.134" offset="18283917">Now, there has been considerable said here and written in the past about the question of whether or not the court was actually presiding at the time was disqualified by the very rationale which I have offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.003" offset="18347342">There was of course a time when juries passed upon facts based upon their personal knowledge of the incident and the time came when disqualification became the very same factor as it was previously considered qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.313" offset="18408573">It is now felt that a jury which has previous knowledge of the facts, personal knowledge of the fact that disqualifies him from sitting at a trial, shouldn't the same reasoning be applied to the Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.359" offset="18448802">I have said the justification for the summary power that exercised in a differed manner is the Judge's knowledge of the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="4599.978" offset="18503241">Well, it has been said by this Court that every contempt of court in the immediate view in presence of the Court is to a certain extent and necessarily an attack upon the Judge as an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.022" offset="18551411">After all it is the judge who is responsible for the order in the Court and the identity between the word Judge and Court on a trial level is something which is felt by all in the Courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.558" offset="18605641">Is it then so that on no occasion where we constitutionally assume that a Judge has the detachment to deal with problems of disorder in the Courtroom, which he is assumed to have in the exercise of so many other his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.231" offset="18684322">I respectfully submit to this court that we cannot make such an assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.390" offset="18704906">Now, the Court of Appeals in his case has indicated that they feel that were practicable, it would be the better procedure for a Judge to disqualify himself when he is the object of an attack and I would be the first to agree that perhaps it is indeed the better practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.575" offset="18781706">This Court indicated in the Offutt case that they had shared that opinion, but I don't think that matters the issue before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.474" offset="18821308">It is not the question of whether it would have been a better practice or whether in this case it would have been better for the Court to disqualify himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.168" offset="18855999">Here the question is was there a violation in due process in the application of this statute by reason of its failure to do so and I submit to this Court that that's an entirely different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.248" offset="18900407">There are many areas of discretion whether it be in the imposition of a sentence or whether it be in the granting of an adjournment which has great effect upon the outcome of a case and which are felt by the litigant as an important issue in the case and yet few of them, few of them rise to that proportion where this Court will state as a matter of constitutional interpretation that there has been a lack of due process in the Court's decision, choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="4776.693" offset="19210115">He stated in so many words that this were a matter between us as individuals, I would ignore, but I'm charged with maintaining the dignity of the Court in which I preside and as the Judge in the Court I must be able to divorce myself and I will and I do and I think there is no reason for believing that he couldn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="5786.628" offset="23249899">In other words, what he wished to do, during this adjournment was not produce evidence, nothing relating to the preparation of the trial of the issue so to speak, but try and have the appeal of the issue adjudicated in advance by writ.</text>

            <text syncTime="6387.003" offset="25651388">However, I think that Justice Jackson in discussing the nature of the power which was embodied in that rule went somewhat beyond the limited question on which certiorari was originally granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6402.070" offset="25711679">I should like to point out one other thing before I sit down and that is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6410.764" offset="25746474">The Sacher case made the point that there is wisdom in the deferment of punishment under certain circumstances, and I would like to relate that doctrine if I can for a moment to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6425.320" offset="25804675">Not only was this witness in the middle of his testimony at the time that this out burst occurred, not only was he required further as a witness which would have made it extremely difficult to punish him, but had it been done in the absence of a jury, I do not think that we can say that there would have been no effect on the trial from the defendant standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="6445.411" offset="25885027">First this Court has indicated that an adjudication of contempt should not be done in secret that it must be a public proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6451.961" offset="25911254">This was a highly publicized trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6453.759" offset="25918360">If the jury did not hear about it directly, they likely would have heard about it indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.982" offset="25939257">Secondly, it may very well be that the jury would have had to have been informed that this witness had been adjudicated in contempt because it was a factor certainly affecting his credibility as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6472.352" offset="25992756">In addition it may have had a very deleterious effect open the bias of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6477.327" offset="26012714">Had this man been adjudicated in contempt and the punishment deferred, he might very well have then slanted his testimony thereafter, abandoned his friendship for Hulan Jack once in for all and become if anything an overly cooperative witness for the people to the defendant's determent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6495.801" offset="26086588">And finally any further witnesses who might have been called by the people might themselves had been pressured or intimidated by the fact that a previous witness was held in contempt on the stand and have been overly favorable to the district attorney or overly cooperative with the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="6544.353" offset="26280835">But I submit that although the Court could have, I think that it would have been a very unwise thing for the Court to have done.</text>
