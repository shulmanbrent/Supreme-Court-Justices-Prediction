            <text syncTime="16.462" offset="169253">I had not intended to and I'm reluctant to go outside of the record in this case, but a statement by the Deputy Attorney General has caused me to feel that I must do so in order to put this case in its proper context and also to defend myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.610" offset="253785">I might say that I am the general counsel for the joint legislative committee and was referred to as one who advised registrars to discriminate against Negroes in the -- when they attempted to register the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.111" offset="311777">I might say that that is just not correct and I feel that the Deputy Attorney General was misinformed, he's acting erroneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.605" offset="361827">To properly explain what had happened in Louisiana, particularly in connection with voting and let's say this is not directly in the record, but I think the Court needs to know it, to understand what have been going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.552" offset="413550">We have laws in Louisiana and have -- have number of other States which require literacy qualifications, also, a certain amount of intelligence qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.566" offset="461615">Those laws, for many years, were not enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.342" offset="480737">The same is true and most of the other States that have those law, they are approximately 15, as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.288" offset="508531">Several years back, we -- we the members of my committee, in discussion with me, asked me to look into the situation on voter -- voting laws and recommend -- make recommendations to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.411" offset="573001">As results of the studies which I have made, we have instituted a program to enforce our laws strictly.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.001" offset="603408">That means to white people and as well as to colored people.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.259" offset="624410">Our efforts have not been successful completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.027" offset="635486">We -- there have been cases we know and we have freely admitted that there are many parishes in which the colored people are discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.084" offset="667669">Also, there are many parishes in which these laws are enforced uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.830" offset="690657">And the Court probably can recall the instances which happened last summer in the legislature of our State in which the Governor of our State suffered a mental and moral breakdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.542" offset="741543">And that was brought on by his attempt to change our voter qualification laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.167" offset="764008">And his reasons for doing so were because we were removing from the roll, many, I think, the term (Inaudible) all white people,” who were the backbones of his -- his political organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.499" offset="829419">And our reasoning on doing this, carrying out this program is this, that we have been plagued in Louisiana for many years, like demagoguery and our political opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.462" offset="877171">And we determined that the only way that we could safely protect ourselves against that is by a rigid enforcement of our voter qualification law.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. M. Shaw</label>
            <text syncTime="208.671" offset="938088">We have removed hundreds, if not thousands.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.554" offset="949582">I say we, not I personally, but people who have consulted with our committee and got an advice, have challenged the legality of the registration of white people in many places.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.641" offset="993886">As a matter fact, it resulted in one lawsuit which will eventually get to this Court in the Parish of St. Landry.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.217" offset="1024188">That happens to be one of the French-speaking parishes and there are many illiterate white people in that parish who do not speak or read English.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.893" offset="1058983">It's going to the attempt that was made -- started out, I think, they removed several hundred of them, before the registrar just tried to refuse to remove any more because of political exigency at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.365" offset="1120841">And I'm saying this in order to remove what I think is an unfair prejudice that surrounds this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.546" offset="1149576">Our program that we have been enforcing in our State is aimed at improving our Government by enforcing laws which on the book and which have been upheld by this Court in an effect upheld recently in North Carolina when the Court refused certiorari in the case from North Carolina on their literacy qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.393" offset="1232959">That is all that I want to say in regard to the background, but if there are any questions, I'd be delighted to answer them because I think haven't got a personal knowledge of what's happened as any person in our State.</text>
