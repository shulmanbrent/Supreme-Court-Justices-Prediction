            <text syncTime="23.420" offset="197047">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.671" offset="210108">The petition here involves the validity of a discharge by Los Angeles County of two of its employees and initially very broadly stated the question as whether or not the discharge was that these employees were so arbitrary as to violate the due process guarantee in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.687" offset="318151">I think perhaps it maybe helpful if I would state to Your Honors in capsule form and very summarily the factual situation or the basis upon which the discharges were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.922" offset="379068">It is our position that the discharge -- the discharge of both petitioners by the County was solely because of their appearance under subpoena before a committee of Congress, the House Committee on Un-American Activities upon which appearance both defendants refused to answer certain questions pertaining to affiliation, pertaining to a communist affiliation upon -- based upon the Fifth Amendment as well as the First.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.490" offset="521383">It is our further contention that the inquiry conducted by the federal agency, House Committee on Un-American Activities was wholly unrelated to fitness for employment to loyalty in connection with fitness for employment by the County.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.850" offset="606751">And our further contention that both the petitioners showed the utmost candor and cooperation so far as their employer was concerned by answering all questions pertaining to their opinion and affiliation when propounded to them by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.420" offset="701001">And that therefore, the rationale if not the decision in Slochower against the Board accompanied by the gloss in Beilan against the Board and in Lerner versus Casey.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.500" offset="781354">Results in a conclusion, this is our plain that the discharges here were arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.233" offset="812283">Let me put the problem a little bit differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.840" offset="826702">In terms of a statute of California, the validity of which as applied we are challenging here.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.557" offset="857631">That statute appears in the petitioners -- in the brief of petitioners, the white brief, on pages 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.887" offset="894934">These petitioners were discharged by the County under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.032" offset="915519">And as I say, as enforced against these petitioners, it is our contention that the statute violates due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.410" offset="953031">The statute appears, as I see on pages 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.007" offset="967450">I shall, in a moment, refer particular to page 3 of the last paragraph of the statute about the middle of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.717" offset="1018232">But let me tell Your Honors what the statute provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.000" offset="1035368">It is a -- it is divisible in two parts, and I make the distinction and the division because we think it’s important to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.111" offset="1075806">This statute imposes an obligation upon all public employees in California to answer certain questions pertaining to affiliation and requires their dismissal if they do not comply with that mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.185" offset="1140067">It requires such employees to answer such questions when asked by the governing agency, governing body that appears on page 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.035" offset="1179564">That portion of the statute is not an issue here because as I have already said, these petitioners answered all questions asked by the governing agency and fulfilled every requirement of any kind imposed upon them by the governing agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.687" offset="1254170">But the statute goes one step further and it is in that regard that we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.259" offset="1276426">The statute additionally imposes an obligation upon all public employees in -- by any governmental agency in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.157" offset="1311953">When appearing was subpoenaed before a committee -- a committee or subcommittee of Congress that appears, Your Honors, at page 2 where the Government Code is being quoted at about the sixth to seventh line of the quotation in the middle of the page.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.353" offset="2752763">Petitions for writ of mandate were filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court in behalf of the petitioners except for petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.253" offset="2784423">The Los Angeles Superior Court ordered the writ of mandate to issue in behalf of one of the petitioner, the petitioner Globe.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.403" offset="2817024">The petitioner Globe under the classified system in California and by the County was a probationary employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.814" offset="2850670">He was summarily dismissed because of his having refused to answer questions on the grounds I've indicated by the County.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.222" offset="2892257">And the Superior Court took the position that that violated the -- the mandate of the rule in the Slochower case to summarily discharge a person for having invoked a privilege before a federal agency and ordered the writ of mandate to issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.346" offset="2952756">And after the petitioner Nelson, the petitioner was a -- is a permanent employee in the classified system of the County and he was entitled to a hearing and he received it.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.922" offset="2995075">In a moment, I shall tell Your Honors about that hearing but the Superior Court ruled adversely to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.699" offset="3018167">And then at each losing side, petitioner Nelson on the one hand, the County of Los Angeles in the Globe case took appeals and the District Court of Appeal upheld the discharges as to both petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.385" offset="3084936">We then filed a petition for hearing in the Supreme Court of California, the highest court of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.436" offset="4825109">And therefore, let me then come to the factual showing which was made by the petitioner Nelson at the hearing which he was accorded under California law, a showing which we say discloses complete condor to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.664" offset="4914030">Submitting full information concerning his opinions and his associations to the employer followed by the acceptance of his -- of that information by the employer, and we think a recognition by the employer that Nelson was a fit employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.995" offset="4995323">And when I say fit, I mean fitness including loyalty in any -- in any meaning that that word passed or has been given by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.850" offset="5034820">Now, here is what happened before the Commission and here is the evidence that he offered to the Civil Service Commission urging that his discharge should not be made final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.641" offset="5093961">He became a temporary employee according to the record in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.784" offset="5122487">The moment he became an employee of the County, it was necessary for him to begin to comply with an elaborate investigatory and check loyalty system which the County of Los Angeles had been in effect a system which this Court passed upon in the opinion written by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Parker against the County of Los Angeles, a system which this Court upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.404" offset="5221021">And he took then a -- what I would call colloquially because it's a shorthand phrase, a -- a loyalty ought but a particular kind of loyalty oath imposed and acquired by the County of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.135" offset="5279953">That loyalty oath was not only an -- the conventional oath of support of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.877" offset="5310882">It had affidavits and it contained an affidavit to the effect that he did not advocate the destruction or govern by violence and that he had not done so, that he did not belong to any organization that so advocates, and that he had not done so, and he was required to list such organizations as he belong to the did and this -- this of course he did not do because he was not a member of any such organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.152" offset="5428015">In addition to that, that list and Mr. Justice Frankfurter had the entire oath attached as an appendix to the opinion of this Court in the Parker case which we referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.214" offset="5492276">In addition to that, he was required to state whether or not he was a member of or had directly or indirectly supported any of the following organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.196" offset="5552149">And then there -- there was a list of 142 organizations consisting of some of the organizations that had appeared on the Attorney General's list of the interstates and a large number about this that a special committee set up by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors had considered sufficiently suspect so as to make inquiry as to membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.785" offset="5642533">And he signed that oath and that affidavit and in -- and checked one of those 142 organizations indicating that he was -- had been a member of it, namely, the United Public -- the United Federal Workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.457" offset="5713168">Now, upon his employment, he was expressly questioned pertaining to his loyalty, pertaining to his affiliation, pertaining to his membership in this organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.163" offset="5759979">And Your Honors will find if Your Honors would look at -- for instance, page 58 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.043" offset="5791535">It isn't the most -- it -- it is a long -- it is a statement in longhand made by Dorothy E.White as you will see on page 58 if you'll turn the page around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.186" offset="5844093">Well, it is an interview by a representative of the County of Los Angeles with the petitioner Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.112" offset="5867813">In the course of which he asked him about his membership in the United Public -- United Federal Workers and he, with complete candor, stated he had been a member for two years from 1942 to 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.021" offset="5919431">And Your Honors will note particularly the less legible portions of this document on page 59 in which he concludes with the statement in -- and this is in her handwriting and her statement that Nelson had said that he was definitely democratic and uphold and against all communistic principles the inter lineation of is by the representative of the County not by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.399" offset="6036982">And so having -- having told the County about that affiliation and satisfied the County with respect to his loyalty, he was employed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.765" offset="6350451">And this statement by Ms. or Mrs. White indicates that he had made the same statement about membership in this organization in 1949 when he was first employed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.738" offset="11230333">It seems to us that where a discharge of a county employee would demonstrate this fitness is based because of his refusal to answer for federal agency upon invoking the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.839" offset="11286758">But certain constitutional considerations and broad policy considerations come into play which might not come into play if the refusal was merely obstinate and adamant and without the use of the privilege for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.144" offset="11351960">In the first place, the use of the privilege before a federal agency is, of course, a right guaranteed by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.889" offset="11386964">This Court has said recently and for many years, it's one of the great privileges and treasures of our -- in our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.078" offset="11423640">It is said that no inference of guilt shall -- shall fall as a result of the use of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.180" offset="11448090">And it is said it is available to the innocent as well as the guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.419" offset="11461047">Now, then, had these petitioners merely stubbornly refused to answer a Congressional Committee?</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.711" offset="11490200">You would not have come into play the -- what we think is an important and ultimately over balancing consideration in favor of these petitioners that all they did is what the Constitution of the United States told them they could do at a place where they had a full right to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.475" offset="11569298">And that therefore a discharge under such circumstances, whether intended by the County or not, has the inevitable respect of diluting or negating or seriously abridging the force and effect of this great constitutional privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.895" offset="11642964">And of course, I could have answered your question by saying we needn't come to that because that's not this case.</text>
