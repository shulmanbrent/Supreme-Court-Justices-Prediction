            <text syncTime="15.968" offset="167267">This case is here on writ of certiorari in the State of Illinois with respect to my application for admission to the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.106" offset="199764">I should like to divide my argument into four parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.555" offset="213556">First, which I attempt the brief survey of the facts of the case, second, to proceed -- to analysis for the character and fitness evidence in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="63.897" offset="359006">I kind of hope to do more and to consider quickly some of the matters which I have -- perhaps rather exhaustedly discussed in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.044" offset="399548">Let me say at the outset, in -- in doing so, a quote from my brief that is well to emphasize which should be apparent from the statement into the case and to the facts which I will narrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.960" offset="471228">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.062" offset="475617">The question of membership in the Communist Party are in the Ku Klux Klan is not an issue in this bar admission case.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.419" offset="505083">But at most, only the effect in the bar admission proceeding of a conscientious refusal to answer in parties about such membership when it's conceded that there is no allegation or evidence in membership when the inquiries occur only in the context of badgering about philosophical and political views, particularly views about the right through -- about the right of revolution, and when silence is couched in a form of refusal to submit to something deemed by the applicant to be in the nature of the test oath and to be improper ungentlemanly and unconstitutional inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.769" offset="678431">This case began 10 years ago in November of 1950 when the occasion of my appearance -- my first appearance before the Bar Admission Committee in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.844" offset="730781">At that time, the questions that were being asked of bar applicants were concerned mostly with what is traditionally considered to be character and fitness matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.146" offset="795982">However, on occasion, the Committee would stray into other areas that is to say if the -- if for some reason the applicant made them suspicious or otherwise antagonize them, there would be -- there would then emerged questions about political matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.745" offset="870379">One of the test questions then being asked was, "Do you believe that a member of the Communist Party should be permitted to practice at bar in Illinois?"</text>
            <text syncTime="201.654" offset="909981">That indeed was a question that was asked to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.616" offset="921788">I answered that I thought that the Communist Party member should be permitted to -- to practice law if these were all -- there was no -- I'm paraphrasing now the first few exchanges."</text>
            <text syncTime="216.479" offset="969331">Thereupon, the discussion turned to the problem of "right of revolution" simply because it was thought that the Communists espouse revolution and therefore should not be eligible for admission."</text>
            <text syncTime="228.696" offset="1018128">I responded with the observation that I thought that espousal or revolution should be no grounds for exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.540" offset="1061491">This -- this prompted rather here to exchange which thereupon led to one of the members of the Committee panel asking, "Are you a member of this or that organization?</text>
            <text syncTime="252.789" offset="1114572">But first of all, give me all your organizations that you're member of," and finally concluding, "Are you a member of the Communist Party?"</text>
            <text syncTime="259.253" offset="1140381">to which I responded that they had no right to ask such a question and that in any event, I will not answer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.663" offset="1162010">And that has been essentially the position ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.118" offset="1183848">I will return to this -- both of these points, the unanswered questions and the refusal and the reviews on Declaration of Independence, the "right of revolution”.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.820" offset="1258663">After the applicant has passed the bar exam and met all the other qualifications.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.400" offset="1308923">This is the last stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.037" offset="1315506">And I may say it's usually a formal, rather formal stage in the sense that -- it's usually applied to have any proceeding is -- is over with.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.687" offset="1350092">The -- in 1954, the Supreme Court of Illinois considered my appeal from that earlier decision and rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.785" offset="1402546">The -- as you know, I attempted to secure review in this Court and failed at that time to secure review.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.145" offset="1439953">Thereupon, in 1957, after the -- this Court handed down the decision in the Konigsberg and Schware cases, I again reapplied for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.511" offset="1477465">The Committee, thereupon, asked me to state my position on two points, one, what are my present views in the "right of revolution”, what is my present attitude toward the questions I had previously refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.922" offset="1551026">And I, thereupon, answered in that supplementary petition, which is found at page 484 of the record, in which I explained my views on "right of revolution” where -- and in which I said that I will continue to refuse to answer any questions about any -- for the organizations, which I should also note at this time, had included questions about Communist Party, the Ku Klux Klan and all other organizations to which you might belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.305" offset="1680593">I appealed from the order of the Court or the Committee refusing to rehear my application.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.543" offset="1709537">And the Supreme Court of Illinois, in the fall of that year, handed down an order which is found in the record and in the Supreme Court opinion of the Court -- in the (Inaudible) of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.814" offset="1778604">That order which is best illuminated if you'll look at pages 6 and 7 of my petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.703" offset="1822177">That order was -- was one in which the Court ordered the Committee or requested the Committee to rehear the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.809" offset="1862614">If you'll notice in the third paragraph of that -- of that order, "The principle question presented by the petition for rehearing concerns the significance of the applicant's views as to the overthrow of government by force in the light of Konigsberg and Yates.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.018" offset="1931473">Additional questions presented concern the applicant's activities since his original application was denied and his present reputation."</text>
            <text syncTime="465.264" offset="1964387">That's on page 7 of my petition of the appendix -- I'm sorry, of the appendix to my petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.389" offset="1988942">Now, if you'll notice that page, exactly opposite down, page 6, you'll find there a dissent of the member -- of one member of the Committee who had -- who has suggested that the Committee should rehear the case without any further proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.789" offset="2066578">Mr. Roscoe suggested that the Committee should not send the case up -- should not deny the rehearing of the application in 1957 but should take on its own to rehear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.480" offset="2113285">And if you'll notice the language of his final paragraph is, except for few minor changes, the language that the Court has self adopted within order of the rehearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.289" offset="2236479">You'll notice that Mr. Roscoe says, "I will grant the petition for rehearing, take evidence on one applicant's activities during the period."</text>
            <text syncTime="542.881" offset="2274931">And you'll notice that's the second point of the Court's order to his present reputation which is the third point of the Court's order, three, his views of the overthrow of the Government, which is the principle question that the Court ordered the Committee to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.252" offset="2340342">And I cannot now show it to you because it requires a very careful analysis of his opinion -- of his dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.048" offset="2371584">But you will see that what had been ruled out by him, as -- in -- no longer applicable for consideration was the refusal of -- my refusal to -- to answer questions about these affiliations.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.924" offset="2431039">He thought that that was no longer applicable because of the Konigsberg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.059" offset="2447653">And consequently, he -- he argues that throughout his opinion then says, "These are the only three questions left."</text>
            <text syncTime="593.045" offset="2475551">And I argued the -- in consequence that the Court also seem to say this by silently rejecting the -- at any reference to the problem of the questions unanswered which the Committee had raised when it -- I've -- I gone before them for the rehearing application.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.178" offset="2580041">This, I suggest, also was their rather tactical way of advising their Committee that there was no need to go off on this again.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.266" offset="2616404">And you will see later, I believe, why they should want -- but first of all to be tackle and two, what it thought it should not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.457" offset="2645243">The Committee, however, disregarded what I take to be -- to have been the mandate of Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.851" offset="4750817">The character affidavits and letters of reference supplied by Anastaplo disclosed that he is well regarded by his academic associates, by professors that had taught to him in school and by lawyers who were personally acquainted with him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.928" offset="4955094">Any realistic appraisal," and this is at the bottom page, "any realistic appraisal of this record indicates that from the search and examination of applicant, from his letters and writings and the responsibilities of a citizen and lawyer to our Government and the writings of statesmen and the scholars, refused to embrace from the affidavits enlisted by the Committee and from the Committee's own independent investigation, you should have well known that his moral -- he should -- he should have well known -- he should have known well George Anastaplo, his moral character and his views respecting our constitutional government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.972" offset="5087274">Moreover, through its power of subpoena, the Committee could have supplemented that fund of knowledge if necessary."</text>

            <text syncTime="1268.988" offset="5179329">This is not quite accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.473" offset="5189256">That is to say, if you -- you will find references collected in the record in the brief at page -- note 54 of my brief in the merit which indicate that a number of investigations or inquiries were indeed made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.315" offset="5256652">And on May 1950 and 1951, an investigator called my hometown at least two occasions and found nothing adverse and consequently nothing to be purported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.641" offset="5301896">And as indicated also by that same -- in the note 54 of my brief, there are indications that members of the Committee on this occasion made independent inquiries of lawyers, teachers, people who knew me in Chicago found nothing adverse and consequently nothing was reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.650" offset="5377964">It seems to be true unless something adverse is found or something that goes against the general trend of the record, it is not worth noting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.805" offset="5646608">And we must not think that the -- the burden in these manners is very heavy in the ordinary sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.594" offset="5685791">I've already referred to the fact that hearings are conducted very quickly usually and more or less pro forma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.290" offset="5712541">The evidence is not allowed to stand as it's indicated both by the Committee and by the Court for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.994" offset="5739395">One, because of some views I expressed in the "right of revolution”, and two because of the questions I have refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.029" offset="5775444">Let me deal with the latter first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.712" offset="5786206">Now, the failure to answer questions as to possible membership in the Communist Party and the Ku Klux Klan which is urged the basis for rejection has to be examined with somewhat more care, I submit, that it has been examined below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.063" offset="5863633">One, I -- I take it, no one has denied that the reasons for not answering these questions are not trivial, that is to say that the sincerity or the refusal to answer doesn't seem to be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.986" offset="5931342">And as you'll see in the record, there are extensive explanation of why the refusal is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.590" offset="5961749">Now -- and especially you will find that my closing argument, which is at page 314 of the record, my more or less comprehensive view of what the case is about and why I have not taken -- I refused to answer for any questions about political affiliations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.083" offset="6031653">Now, I'm prepared to argue that the questions themselves are generally improper for bar admission proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.458" offset="6061223">But that is unnecessary to be reached here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.670" offset="6074075">I -- I have set forth the arguments in the brief but let me go on to consideration of what the failure to answer in this context means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.111" offset="6123813">The -- let me emphasize first of all that there is not any statute or rule in Illinois requiring the asking of questions about affiliations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.407" offset="6164982">The only requirement is to respect the character and fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.761" offset="6178461">And on page 7 of -- of my brief, you will find the principle controlling rule set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.591" offset="6241782">It is the rule of Supreme Court of Illinois which sets up the Committee and prescribes its powers in which -- which concludes, if the Committee is of the opinion that the applicant is of approved moral -- approved character and moral fitness, it shall -- so -- it shall so certify to the Board of Law Examiners and the applicants shall thereafter be entitled to admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.244" offset="6332374">Now, if you compare this to the statutes which require non-communist oaths, such as one we have in Illinois, for employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.971" offset="6367274">You will find that this isn't worth -- this is more difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.496" offset="6381380">There is no requirement anywhere that is placed upon the Committee either by rule of court, by statute or by decision that no requirement that they must get into these questions that they must settle them, that they must answer them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.183" offset="6448149">In fact, as I've already -- the 1957 order which -- which -- under which this rehearing was conducted can be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.627" offset="6477928">It can be read as implicitly suggesting to them that they'll not go into these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.858" offset="6514813">In fact, Judge Bristol, at 535, addresses himself to this very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.268" offset="6544488">He says, "Although the majority report denied applicant admission to the Bar essentially because they claimed his failure to reply to questions on membership in the Communist Party or other subversive groups, prevented inquiry in the subjects which bear an issue of character, it is significant that the majority made favorable findings on all matters designed for inquiry in our rehearing order."</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.544" offset="6645530">They found that applicants the use of "right of revolution” was not objectionable nor was there anything objectionable in its activities since the original petition was denied or with respect to its present reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.463" offset="6697253">If there is no rule, if there is no statute, if there is no order requiring these questions to be asked or answered, what basis is there?</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.353" offset="6740825">Well, the only basis for asking the questions seems to have been the espousal of the Declaration of Independence, that is the concession the Attorney General seems to make in pages 9 and 30 of his brief and to this I will return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.734" offset="6818356">Then we have, in evaluating the refusal of the question -- refusal to answer his questions we have the concession, which I have already quoted, that is to say the concession for the Committee that they have no evidence with respect to this matter whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.370" offset="6888887">Yet, the Committee acclaims that they have been obstructed in the -- in the fulfillment of their duty, that without answers to these questions, they cannot reach the decision as to whether or not, one's character and fitness is adequate for admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.198" offset="6960149">Now, this obstruction, I take it, must be one of two kinds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.942" offset="6979166">It can be a constructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.835" offset="6986689">It's not the word they used, but I think it's better than any word they do use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.886" offset="7010931">Attorney General seems to suggest this in his argument, he talks about presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.637" offset="7033919">But this kind of constructive obstruction, I submit, would follow only if there is a legal basis for requiring answers to all questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.655" offset="7078013">But I also have -- must say that there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.260" offset="7092433">And there -- and furthermore, there was not in this hearing any kind of indication that questions must be answered, all questions must be answered at every point where the Committee was near giving anything like a warning that all questions must be answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.233" offset="7156276">They qualified it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.890" offset="7162964">And you will see this throughout the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.733" offset="7170278">You'll see it throughout my brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.212" offset="7180204">The brief in the merits is consigned -- is devoted primarily to a very long and I think careful summary of the facts of the case and I have italicized in it the various places where the Committee backs away from any kind of warning, from any kind of clear indication that they would not consider further application in which one has refused to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.619" offset="7281873">They -- they simply say that this would be one more piece of evidence, that's the most they can say, serious, perhaps, but one more piece of evidence, not a clear cut basis of rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.760" offset="7338402">The -- and of course, a good example of why this kind of warning cannot be made, why the rule cannot be made, is effect that you can see the religious questions because the Committee members are essentially uncontrolled and uncontrollable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.325" offset="7404648">Everyone can ask what he pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.270" offset="7412485">There is no effort, so far as I've ever seen, to restrain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.561" offset="7429622">Consequently, the Committee does not want to bind itself to whatever any particular member might add and -- and therefore, they cannot make a more formal rule such as that which might follow that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.576" offset="7481657">If you don't give your name, if you don't give us your criminal record, if you don't answer to fill out the questionnaire, therefore, we will not teach you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.920" offset="7515094">That -- that's the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.381" offset="7524916">Now, if there is not what I call constructive obstruction, I think everything in the record would indicate there cannot be constructive obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.370" offset="7560861">If there is not what I call constructive obstruction, was their actual obstruction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.567" offset="7577684">What would they, in fact, unable to reach a conclusion of character and fitness?</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.849" offset="7602761">Well, did this impede them?</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.660" offset="7618017">As I've said before, this Committee hearing ran on for 20 hours or so over several months, 20 hours after the first refusal to answer was -- was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.593" offset="7665768">In fact, the Supreme Court of Illinois knew even before the hearing started that would continue to refuse to answer these questions that document, I've referred to you already at page 484 on basis of which the -- the order in 1957 was granted was itself -- clearly indicate -- itself clearly indicated that I would continue to stick my position I've taken before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.637" offset="7777886">And yet, the -- the order did grant the rehearing and the rehearing ran.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.308" offset="7796590">Now, furthermore, the fact is that the Committee, not only knew the question and not answer, but they again, again said they wanted to know the reasons why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.359" offset="7832848">They want to examine with, they want to discuss it, which I've cleared the implication that the thing was open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.024" offset="7859493">Furthermore, I should think that if a Committee is going to allege obstruction, it must act as if it had been obstructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.706" offset="7894183">That's not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.219" offset="7900244">You cannot say that a record which ran for 400 pages after the first or several hundred pages, I say, at least 350 pages after the first questions refusal to answer were put to an applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.496" offset="7961370">You cannot say that that is obstruction, obstructive hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.435" offset="7973073">The Committee ran, I suppose it, one or two, they asked all the questions they wanted to, Oath Committee members asked questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.475" offset="7997315">True, they could not ask questions that would follow from the refusal from an answer as to affiliations but that is not, I there say, much of -- of objection because it says the fact that their concession about no evidence and no other -- and no information to this respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.020" offset="8759463">On the other hand, I would not rely upon that distinction because as I said to you, even with -- even with such notice, I still would not have answered these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.985" offset="8803349">Now -- now the problem is then, I -- I take it, the real question is what does this refusal which is clearly, I believe, on some kind of principle whether misguided or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.599" offset="8853817">What does this refusal mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.286" offset="8864475">I think it's one piece of evidence to be evaluated like all the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.841" offset="8886732">Now, I'm not suggesting that this Court should act as State Supreme Court judges or as legislators, second guessing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.570" offset="8921631">Or I realized some of you may well think that if you had been on this Committee or if you've been on a court, you might have acted differently from the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.934" offset="8955068">That is not the point I'm making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.021" offset="8963427">The point I'm making is this, if you had been an applicant and you were asked these questions and you refused to answer in thinking that they were improper, uncalled for, unfounded or for any number of reasons that have some plausibility and which in the record are very clearly shown to be based on some kind of principle, constitutional rather, would your refusal on these circumstances -- should I refuse them -- these terms has to be regarded as adverse evidence to application for admission on moral and character grounds?</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.882" offset="9090905">That is the issue and not what you would not -- would or would not do if you were sitting in the seat as Supreme Court judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.841" offset="9558706">And the fact that there is this kind of atmosphere and this kind of intimidation, in bullying of applicants, is one reason why I have taken the position that I have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.255" offset="10924387">Anastaplo testified," and this is in accurate quotation, "I would not care to say, there might not be instances where resistance to an officer of the law executing such a mandate might not be improper."</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.303" offset="10976632">But what is not quite accurate is the interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.837" offset="10990738">And for this, I prefer Judge Bristol at page 528 which I think conforms to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.517" offset="11021458">"The per curiam opinion clutches its strolls by even referring to Anastaplo's views and resistance to a court decree as grounds for denying admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.937" offset="11067120">In view of his unequivocal statement that he would resist a court decree only under circumstances where constitutional government has been subverted, so the resistance would really be aimed at restoring our Constitution and supporting it without reservation."</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.531" offset="11129501">Surely, this is no war against the Constitution as per curiam opinion implies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.297" offset="11152593">And I must say again that if a court, if the highest court of the land, as this Court is, were to hand out a mandate in circumstances where there either demand were in circumstances, where it's clear, the constitutional government has been corrupted and destroyed, then one is obliged to resist such a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.490" offset="11273383">Now, I know of no instance when this has ever happened in the history of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.799" offset="11302536">But if sometime the judges who occupy this Court should become so corrupted, so mistaken, so perverted in their notion about what their duty is as to destroy our constitutional government, I dare say we're all obliged to resist such a decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.184" offset="11384142">We -- we have examples all over the world where the highest courts of the land have handed down, have been in submission of such tyranny.</text>

            <label>Mr. William C. Wines</label>
            <text syncTime="3048.761" offset="12298428">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.303" offset="12312534">May I begin by remarking on the question with which Mr. Anastaplo concluded his presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.073" offset="12347643">The question whether the Supreme Court of Illinois or anyone else could reasonably find on this record that Mr. Anastaplo is not of a character and fitness to qualify him for the Bar is not presented on this case because no member of the Supreme Court of Illinois so found or said that he's so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.816" offset="12446595">The Attorney General makes no such point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.747" offset="12462373">I can make clear the restricted basis and therefore, the limited scope of the questions presented by this case if I may make an extremely brief chronicle of what we conceived to be the salient facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.884" offset="12550875">I should like to say at the outset that through a misunderstanding that can't possibly be have -- have been due to anything more sinister, devious or subversive than inexperience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.953" offset="12611166">Mr. Anastaplo did not serve the Attorney General with the petition for the writ of certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.388" offset="12640946">The first intelligence that the Attorney General or the highest chief of this appeal section have, the petition had been filed or that there was such a case in this Court was when he received the clerk's telegram saying that their writ had been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.694" offset="12706147">What happened was that Mr. Anastaplo, I'm sure in the utmost good faith, did serve the Chicago Bar Association or its president or Committees, did serve the Supreme Court of Illinois but neither of those bodies transmitted the petition to us because neither of them suppose that he hadn't serve the Attorney General and that's why no answer was filed to the petition in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.683" offset="12826102">With that explanation, I should now like to show the Court the really limited scope of the questions presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.346" offset="12868733">Mr. Anastaplo granted -- graduated from the University of Chicago, College of Law in the year 1950, I believe, and I think I should add though he's -- he can properly that he graduated with distinction from that institution and that appears in the record or I wouldn't mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.846" offset="12954728">He successfully passed the Illinois bar examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.395" offset="12976985">He appeared before the Committee on Character and Fitness which is composed of members of the Chicago Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.351" offset="13020766">Mr. Anastaplo, having written on the subject of revolution, language that I don't think intrinsically or per se suggest -- I -- may I withdraw that, intrinsically or per se declares any thoughts more subversive than those embodied in the Declaration of Independence was asked some questions as to what he meant by these writings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.061" offset="13227656">He declined to answer those questions, not suggesting any privilege against self-incrimination but asserting what he conceived to be a constitutional right of privacy stemming from the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of the freedom of speech, political assembly and possibly other First Amendment' rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.886" offset="13326921">He was then asked, I think in those first hearings, whether he was a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.999" offset="13363388">He declined to answer that question, again, asserting what he conceived to be a constitutional right of privacy in silence under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.707" offset="13410200">No claim that a truthful answer would tend to incriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.547" offset="13433605">He was then asked whether he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3340.612" offset="13465788">And he was then asked whether he was a member of the Silver Shirts, a fascist organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.341" offset="13492746">And he made a similar response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.038" offset="13507480">He was then asked whether he was a member of any association on the Attorney General's list of subversive organizations and he made a similar response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.405" offset="13553037">Somebody asked him, we make no point of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.201" offset="13564217">We think the question was improper but absolutely innocuous whether he was a member of the Republican or Democratic Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.658" offset="13597968">That question was obviously intended simply to find out what kind of questions he thought he ought to be asked not with anyone would qualify or disqualify him for any answer that he might make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.760" offset="13654392">And he was asked those questions about his memberships -- I mean possible memberships in subversive organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.435" offset="13709145">He was then asked a different type of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.793" offset="13730565">He was asked many questions as to his beliefs, his views or opinions which, of course, are very different things from memberships and affiliations on such topics as the "right of revolution”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.353" offset="13800782">Some of these questions he declined to answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="4254.682" offset="17122095">In the sense that this Court has said, "Belief in its nature is absolute" though there maybe secrecy about memberships or affiliations.</text>

            <text syncTime="5578.180" offset="22416071">"Refusal to answer questions as the petitioner's membership in the Communist Party," I should say that's Communist Party and others subversive organizations, "has prevented the Committee from inquiring fully into his general fitness and good citizenship and justifies their refusal to issue a certificate."</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.025" offset="22519515">In other words, the only ground that the Supreme Court ultimately gave for refusing petitioner's admission was that he declined to answer questions as to his possible membership in subversive organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5627.231" offset="22612302">And the question is whether Illinois may constitutionally require an applicant to answer such a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5640.666" offset="22666010">Now, petitioner seems to disclaim in his oral argument any contention that actual membership in the Communist Party or other subversive organization, even if proved or admitted, would disqualify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.674" offset="22742079">But in his brief, he seems to make that contention because he says that even -- that the Communist Party and the Ku Klux Klan are entitled to the protection of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.774" offset="22886484">I don't know what he means by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.104" offset="22895783">But it seems to indicate that even admitted membership in those organizations wouldn't disqualify him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.764" offset="22926399">However, in our brief we do argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.022" offset="22947506">First, that membership in the Communist Party, if I may explain, word per se be a valid ground for disqualifying petitioner from admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.592" offset="23005706">We think it suffices to cite Your Honors' decision in the Dennis case holding that membership, which I entered, of its criminal purposes in that Party is a federal felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5741.091" offset="23067773">We also point out that although the Communist Party doesn't, so far as I know at the moment, profess any anti-racial discriminations, the Silver Shirts and the Ku Klux Klan do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5758.560" offset="23137573">They have racial defamation and vilification for one of their objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.463" offset="23157217">And Illinois punishes racial defamation and vilification under a statute that Your Honors held constitutional in the White Circle case, Beauharnais against Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="5778.659" offset="23218030">And we say that membership that -- in an organization, I mean always, which I entered, it has, for its object, the violation of a criminal statute of the State of Illinois is ground for disqualification from membership in the Illinois Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.994" offset="23287306">Also, Illinois punishes as murder not only those who actively participate in an actively plotted a killing but who belong to an organization knowing that it has murder for its object if murder results even though they neither participated in nor plotted the particular murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.858" offset="23390856">That was held in the Haymarket riot case and while there has been much criticism of that case on the ground that the defendants may not have been proved guilty and didn't get a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.300" offset="23436622">We know of no dissent, responsible dissent, judicial, academic or any other kind or dissents from the major premise that those who are guilty of abandon that they know has murder for its object are guilty of murder if murder results from their confederation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.722" offset="23518229">Now, the next question arises is if membership in anyone of these three organizations as a ground for disqualification, may we ask an applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.718" offset="23562219">I should think, Your Honor, that if we're right that if the -- an affirmative and unexplained, I want to repeat, unexplained answer would disqualify for admission, then we must have the right to ask the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.643" offset="23637974">I do think this of -- if an applicant says, "Yes, yes, I'm a member of the Communist Party."</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.922" offset="23659081">We can't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.859" offset="23666813">We have to say, "Do you have an explanation?"</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.479" offset="23677262">"Oh, yes, I can tell you, this is a closed hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.649" offset="23690010">I am an agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.765" offset="23706415">They know all about my membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.679" offset="23722088">Here are my credentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="5906.585" offset="23729716">Yes, I am writing an exposé.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.159" offset="23744031">I can tell you in confidence or a doctor's thesis in such and such university."</text>
            <text syncTime="5916.123" offset="23767855">I -- maybe the Committee would then think that the man was a patriot, not a potential traitor and -- or maybe the Supreme Court would so think and happily admit him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5930.969" offset="23827205">It's just barely imaginable from the immigration cases or hardly in the case of one who had graduated from a law school that he might admit membership, but not in a Communist Party, at least in some other subversive organization, but convince the Committee that he was a version of any knowledge of its criminal purposes even though he did know that it held some extremely latitudinarian social views.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.839" offset="23934725">Now, petitioner seems to think, and this is where I find so much difficulty in filing, that there is at stake in this case, some, maybe, principle of constitutional treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.030" offset="24003480">If he disclaims, as I understood him to disclaim, that as any contention that actual membership were proved to remit him in Communist Party disqualifies him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.928" offset="24055097">I would not -- this means the contention that it wouldn't disqualify him, then I don't see much substance for the contention that we can't ask him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.974" offset="24091251">Now, we take this position very strongly and emphatically in our brief that the rule in Illinois is that no amount of overwhelming and wholly uncontradicted proof of good character and will dispatch with simple answers to simple questions and we say that for each of two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.374" offset="24196890">In the first place in any kind of judicial proceedings, saving only a question of privilege on the ground of self-incrimination and not communication between the husband and wife, attorney and client, penitent and confessing -- and -- and confessor, you can ask any party to any kind of a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding any question that's relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6050.269" offset="24304410">Now, we put the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6051.835" offset="24310680">There were many cases in the laws of all the States where the personal oath as to matters of that of an applicant for a privilege is required and that's true even though the privileges once that -- one that once all constitutional requirements are met (Inaudible) is -- is entitled to the protection in the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6072.616" offset="24393853">For example, in Illinois, if you want to vote and certainly if your vote is challenged but even if it isn't, you have to take an oath that you're 21 years old, that you lived in the State a year, the county 90 days, in the precinct 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="6089.314" offset="24460622">It won't do to decline to take that oath but offer to bring in the affidavit of 50 people who know that you were born in the home where you're now living and have lived their for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.356" offset="24516838">And if you want a marriage license, you will have to make an oath that you are not married, although ordinarily, there's a presumption of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.259" offset="24552364">You can't just indict a man for bigamy and say "Prove that you don't have two wives".</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.075" offset="24575666">But until you take that oath, you don't get that license.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.477" offset="24589249">You can't bring in 50 neighbors who know that you never lived with a woman as your wife, introduced her as your wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.799" offset="24614536">Nobody ever heard you -- never heard that you were married.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.122" offset="24631881">There were many such cases where you have to make a personal oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.826" offset="24650689">Now, it's true that in Mr. Anastaplo's case, after compiling a record of these dimensions, no member of the Supreme Court of Illinois was able to reach an affirmative conclusion that Mr. Anastaplo is a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6155.600" offset="24725817">Certainly, the Attorney General doesn't think he is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.706" offset="24738147">We know we're almost sure he's not on all three a Communist or fascist and a member of the Silver Shirts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6166.486" offset="24769285">It'd be most remarkable if he were.</text>
            <text syncTime="6170.156" offset="24784018">But do we have to compile such a record every time an applicant chooses, without (Inaudible) saving any reason for it that it will embarrass him, that it would be misunderstood, that it will incriminate him even if it isn't a privilege, there might be some good reason where a person wouldn't care to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6195.179" offset="24884120">I can't think of one but there might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="6197.076" offset="24891643">But when he gives no reason why do we have to have a hearing and -- and to compile transcript of these dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.199" offset="24940126">I do think that an applicant can walk into the clerk's office here and say, "I want to be admitted to the Bar."</text>
            <text syncTime="6220.204" offset="24984221">Well, have you ever been disbarred in your own State?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.165" offset="24999999">"Well, I won't tell you but I've got affidavits of a lot of people who think that I haven't been and have no -- they have no reason to believe that I have and would probably know if I were."</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.076" offset="25051721">We say that once you granted it that the -- that the matter of Communist affiliation is material, then it follows automatically that a question as to whether he's a member of the Communist Party is material.</text>
            <text syncTime="6253.871" offset="25118908">Petitioner suggests that we owed to substitute the presumption of innocence for the presumption of guilt in these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6261.635" offset="25149942">Well, that's just exactly what we do not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.725" offset="25166242">We require an affirmative showing of good character.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.096" offset="25187767">That showing is the extremely light when there isn't anything to contradict, just as we require a man to take an oath that he's over 21 before we'll admit him to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.916" offset="25243042">If he isn't over 21 and he's granted to get admitted to the Bar anyway, he is trying to do something that is at least illegal, if not, unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="6293.226" offset="25276270">We make him take an oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="6294.600" offset="25281808">We don't take his birth certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6297.405" offset="25292988">We could get a question as to whether he was 21 within the evidence but I never heard of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.876" offset="25318902">And we ask, we do ask on our questionnaire, "Have you ever been convicted of a crime?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6311.997" offset="25351398">It's easier to ask him than it is to ransack the records of every penitentiary in the United States for every applicant who comes before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="6324.039" offset="25399568">If we can't ask this questionnaire, "Are you a Communist?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6327.321" offset="25412629">Then, there are almost no questions that we can ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="6330.784" offset="25426526">If, as petitioner suggests, we have to have some -- some kind of probable cause, such as you need to get a search warrant or to examine books or make an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.071" offset="25483682">We didn't have it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6347.256" offset="25492355">We did get some, I think, ambiguous writings about revolution.</text>

            <text syncTime="6765.230" offset="27164296">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6765.595" offset="27165759">The question in the questionnaire is, "State what you consider to be the principles underlying the Constitution of United States."</text>
            <text syncTime="6773.784" offset="27198464">But I must frankly say, I don't think this was really the basis of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6779.162" offset="27219989">I mean I'm quite willing to accept the Attorney General's characterization of this -- the basis, but I don't think it would be fair for me to let it rest it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.823" offset="27250709">I think the basis of the inquiry was my -- my first answer to the question, "Do you think a member of the Communist Party should be permitted to practice?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6796.090" offset="27287698">I still think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6797.821" offset="27294699">I think this is the case of the member of the Ku Klux Klan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6801.041" offset="27307551">I -- if were a member of the Committee, I would be inclined to vote for either one knowing nothing else about them, if -- this was the only evidence against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6809.362" offset="27340779">But if the Attorney General must point to something, this is the only thing he pointed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6814.488" offset="27361364">The next thing I can point out is that on a service point, this was raised in the Attorney General's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6820.994" offset="27387382">I have answered it at length in my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6824.275" offset="27400443">I need to only point to page 4 of my reply brief which I quote, "I had written to the clerk my present plans or to file to the clerk of the Supreme Court of Illinois my present plans where to file my petitioner for writ of certiorari in the next week or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6840.189" offset="27464077">I would appreciate learning from you whether the Court has authorized anyone to receive service for it in this matter."</text>
            <text syncTime="6846.075" offset="27487692">The clerk replied to me, "As far as this office is informed, the Court has not authorized anyone to receive service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6853.362" offset="27516844">It would be my suggestion, however, to make service in Richard H. Cain in this matter who happened to be the Secretary of the Committee."</text>
            <text syncTime="6859.476" offset="27541295">I do not rest to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6860.470" offset="27545266">I served the Committee, Chairman of the Committee, Secretary of the Committee, Chief Justices of the State of Illinois and the clerk of the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.329" offset="27580688">And I also indicated to each of them that I was serving the others and no others.</text>
            <text syncTime="6875.075" offset="27603675">They had no grounds for suggesting the Attorney General of Illinois had not been served.</text>
            <text syncTime="6880.079" offset="27623737">I mean for assuming that's turned down or had been served, they knew and I had made all -- as you will see there in my reply brief, I had exhausted my efforts to file whom to serve.</text>
