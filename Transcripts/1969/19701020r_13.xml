            <label>Mr. Will R. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="32.049" offset="231528">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.974" offset="239261">This is a reargument, our second argument of this case, therefore, I am going to assume that the Court is somewhat familiar with the case and I point out that it involves a criminal conviction for the sale of heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.390" offset="324942">The principal law point center in the application of the Fourth Amendment to the investigatory process which was an overhearing by radio without warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.567" offset="365589">There are other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.319" offset="368619">The first issue that the defendant stresses is whether the informant who made the purchase gave his consent to being equipped or wired with a radio for the purpose of transmitting the interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.904" offset="431000">The second issue is whether there were, in this investigatory process a search and seizure which required a warrant where no warrant was issued, therefore go to the admissibility of the evidence obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.935" offset="495156">The third issue concerns the trial procedure where the informant or purchaser did not himself testify and the case was made exclusively from the testimony of the investigatory agents who observed the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.753" offset="570389">The fourth issue is the retroactivity of the Katz case under Desist.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.409" offset="604975">Now to speak briefly to the consent of the informant or the purchaser or the agent, the government's position is that the whole course of conduct establishes an overwhelming basis for the consent of the informant to have a radio placed on him and to go through with the transaction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Will R. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="170.574" offset="785638">Yes, in this situation most of the interviews have occurred in the home of the agent and the informant and the two of the government agents were stationed across the street, it will transmit for a mile or so.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="185.345" stopTime="189.354">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="185.345" offset="844779">Presumably, they were sitting in the car with -- where they were listening to it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="will_r_wilson" startTime="189.354" stopTime="835.902">
            <label>Mr. Will R. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="189.354" offset="860766">I believe it was the car or another, it was something -- it was across the street from where the thing occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.980" offset="887306">Now going to the consent of the informant who -- part of the procedure, he met the agents at one place where they searched him to determine that he was not -- he had no narcotics and all of these informants are themselves addicts that are used by the investigatory body to make the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.066" offset="987617">The search team for narcotics found that he had not on him, put the radio on him, gave him money and then went with him to his home where one of the informants hid in a closet in the kitchen of the -- I mean, one of the government agents hid in a closet of the kitchen and the other two were across the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.939" offset="1091166">There were four such meetings over a period of roughly 30 days in addition to a telephone conversation that was overheard, and two conversations on the car and one in a restaurant; some 8 or 9 transactions over a period of 30 days and our position is that any objective viewing of this course of conduct would establish without question that the informant did consent to the procedure and did cooperate with it in the sense that consent is an element in a consensual overhearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.888" offset="1230973">The informant's name was Harvey Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.071" offset="1247692">He called him on the telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.296" offset="1260544">In addition to that he took delivery of several -- deliveries of heroin which he in turn, turned over to the government agents and he accepted from the government agents $1,000, $1,350 and $1,300 which he in turn paid over at one time or another for the purchase of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.620" offset="1345808">We say that this whole course of conduct establishes that the informant, Harvey Jackson, did consent in the sense that is of material to the Fourth Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.617" offset="1405889">The defendant himself in his arguments, attacks or raises questions about the motivation of the informant for consenting and we say that, that's wholly immaterial as to why he did it, but now getting to the analysis of the facts, the law point centered around the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment questions, and I want to give you -- take the set of facts, typical set of facts and go through them and analyzing against the contentions of those amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.851" offset="1570774">Harvey Jackson met three government agents at 57th and Outer Drive, where the searched him, installed a radio, gave him the money and the group together went to Harvey Jackson's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.044" offset="1627512">One of the government agents, hid in a closet with the door cracked open where he could see and hear the transaction that was about to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.104" offset="1659800">Two of them went across the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.562" offset="1669622">The defendant White came in the back door, came into the kitchen of the government informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.736" offset="1698356">They sat down together.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.995" offset="1711313">There was a commercial transaction, that is, an offer and acceptance, a delivery of the merchandise, and a payment for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.875" offset="1750915">Then White, the defendant got up and left and after that Jackson turned the narcotics over to the government agent who was in the closet.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.824" offset="1802637">Now there is no Fifth Amendment problem in this, because this was the event, this was the crime itself and there is no confession or admission involved -- there is nothing that came from the lips of the defendant referring to past events.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.856" offset="1894797">So there can't be a question of him testifying against himself in this question, because none of the proof involved the introduction of any statements by the defendant with reference to a past event.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.083" offset="1947669">All of them are to a current event which is a commercial transaction of the crime itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.028" offset="1971493">There is no Sixth Amendment question involved in this because he was not under arrest, at anytime any of the statements were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.688" offset="2010154">There was nothing he said after arrest that was introduced in evidence and so there is no question about him being entitled to counsel or to be furnished counsel or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.289" offset="2048502">So the only constitutional question as I see it that could be involved are the questions of the Fourth Amendment, and thus was this an unreasonable search and seizure without a warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="496.829" offset="2090715">Now first taking the factual situation, the narcotics themselves, the existence of the narcotics, White sold the narcotics to Jackson, the government's man and voluntarily delivered it to the government agent in his own kitchen, generally, or in his own automobile in other situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.909" offset="2175039">After White parted with both the title and possessions of the narcotics, he had no legal rights in those narcotics at all, even as an illegal transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.763" offset="2214431">Jackson could do anything he wanted to with those narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.383" offset="2224880">He could flush them down the toilet, throw them out of the window or give them to a government agent and it was none of White's business what Jackson did with those narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.224" offset="2260302">So, there was no seizure of the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.729" offset="2270333">They were voluntarily delivered to the government by the man who'd bought them, and I don't see that there could be any question about there being, needed a warrant to get the possession of the narcotics come out of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.806" offset="2322578">Now let's pass to the agent in the closet.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.847" offset="2342745">His testimony was verbal.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.401" offset="2349014">He was put on by direct examination, by cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.811" offset="2374614">When defendant White went to another man's house for a commercial transaction, he had no legal right to say who was present or not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.760" offset="2414425">The man who owned the house had the right to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.270" offset="2428426">And so consequently, he had no legal right to an expectation of privacy that there wouldn't be anybody else in his customer's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.090" offset="2467715">The customer had a right to bring anybody he wanted to in his house, and he had a right to hide him in the closet if he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.605" offset="2497808">There are many cases that hold that.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.858" offset="2506794">To hold it otherwise would be to make the event itself unprovable with direct evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.851" offset="2530826">And there wasn't any difference between a witness sitting in a closet who eyeballs this transaction and sees and hears the transaction, and then testifies to it later, then a witness standing on the corner, who sees it next to him and testifies about it and that's not a search and seizure problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.634" offset="2609925">And so there is no question of there being any necessity for a warrant to introduce the testimony of the eyeball witness to the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.090" offset="2651721">Now, let's pass to the agents across the street which is really the arguable situation here, that were listening in on the radio by the consent and invitation of Harvey Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.212" offset="2708250">Now this is not an On Lee situation where the government used an old friend after indictment of the defendant to extract an admission or confession of a past event with the agents listening in by radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.079" offset="2771675">That's not this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.654" offset="2782020">Here the agents were listening to event itself happen, to the crime being committed in the consummation of a commercial transaction as barred below.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.348" offset="2824756">The commission of the crime itself is not protected against direct proof by any legal expectation of privacy and I think that's a fundamental statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.092" offset="2867702">You cannot go into the commission of a crime with the expectation of privacy that you won't be observed or the proof won't be offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.850" offset="2906781">Consider a bank robbery situation, where the bank lobby is rigged with the secret camera and secret radio and secret recorder to obtain good proof of the happening of the bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.340" offset="2972714">Does this require a search warrant, obviously not.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.998" offset="2991313">It would be wholly impractical to require the bank to get a search warrant each day of its operation and there they might have a robbery that day and there would be no proper cause and lots of other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.837" offset="3030706">But the use of electronics to record the happening of the crime in a bank robbery is not a search and seizure situation requiring a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.185" offset="3076159">Does the bank robber have any legal expectation of privacy which shields him from proof of the event itself, by any direct evidence, either electronically recorded or otherwise, obviously not.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.533" offset="3137494">Does a narcotic peddler, in making his sale, delivery and collection of money, have any greater legal right to an expectation of privacy than the bank robbery, obviously not, he should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.063" offset="3195591">The gathering of the evidence of the event itself with either camera or radio or any other electronic device should not require a warrant in either situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.819" offset="3246686">The Fourth Amendment protects certain places and certain relations and certain people.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.622" offset="3273853">Let's look at the relationship between Harvey Jackson and defendant White.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.152" offset="3296005">It was that of a buyer and seller at a commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.549" offset="3309589">It was not a confidential relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.786" offset="3322546">It was not an old friend as in the Chana (ph) case, was not a lawyer-client, not a doctor-patient, not a priest-penitent, not a husband-wife, it was not a relationship that would be protected in the sense of a right of expectation of privacy out of the relationship, so that leaving aside the place altogether, the Fourth Amendment wouldn't attach to that relationship of a commercial transaction which is it by law illegal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.000" offset="4103398">Our statement about electronic was a little too broad on that scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.653" offset="4137984">Now let's come to the telephone conversation, where the Court will recall, Jackson, the government informant went to the telephone and called the defendant White for the purpose of making his date to pay some money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.086" offset="4203708">And he took with him a government agent who went into the phone-booth with him and listened by holding his ear up close to the telephone and he listened to Jackson to the end of the conversation with the consent of Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.777" offset="4262431">Now that gets closer to the Fourth Amendment problem in my judgment than anything else in the case, at this juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.991" offset="4303287">But again, it's a consent case and you should take the Rathbun case which you remember is the telephone extension case, where the man was listening on an extension of the telephone, instead of listening to the very telephone itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.335" offset="4356681">It was held that, that was not a warrant situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.708" offset="4374235">And we see really little difference in this case and the Rathbun case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.331" offset="4404746">Again, I point out that what the agent listened to was not an admission or confession and so there is no Fifth or Sixth Amendment and only a Fourth Amendment problem in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.885" offset="4442885">It was not a wire tap and it was not an uninvited ear because he was invited by one party to the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.758" offset="4486353">And we see really no difference between when you get to looking at it, between that instant in the telephone booth and the instant of the radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.324" offset="4528671">Now there was a car, I believe were two cars and I think they are substantially the same situation as the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.163" offset="4563989">The next is defendant White's home, which -- where the agent went by himself, but equipped with the radio where government officers could listen to the conversation in defendant White's home, but again we say that the Lewis case, squarely holds that there is no invasion of the privacy of the home when defendant converts his home to a commercial use by selling narcotics, that's the square holding of the Lewis case and secondly, you have got the consent element as far as electronics are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.746" offset="4718320">And the Lopez case supports a consensual recording and I see really no difference between a consensual recording and a consensual radio which broadcasts somebody else to either overhear or record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.044" offset="4787597">So in summation of this point, we say there was no violation of a confidential relationship to which the Fourth Amendment could attach and there was no violation of a protected place to which a Fourth Amendment could attach in all of these situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.330" offset="5580675">But our position on that is the question of the tactics of the trial and the use of the witnesses is not a constitutional question, that the necessity of obtaining a warrant and its constitutionality must be determined at the time of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.935" offset="5647130">And you don't know then whether or not who is going to testify, whether there'd be any trial at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.336" offset="5672730">And so we say that, that this maybe some other type of law problem, but the question of whether the witness is used isn't -- it can't be a factor in determining constitutionality of the search and the necessity for a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2169.871" offset="8782869">But if this Court should reverse this case, it’s going to permit the government to electronically eavesdrop on conversations that the speaker thinks are private, that they are not going to be electronically recorded or transmitted to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.593" offset="8873775">Of course, since the government argues that they should be able to do this, not only without a warrant, but without even probable cause, but on rumor alone I think the chances of abuse are enormous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.153" offset="11840031">Of course, that case has been submitted there now, but the government did take the possession there that there was no Fifth, Sixth, or Fourth Amendment violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2982.283" offset="12032502">Perhaps the most difficult, one of the most difficult judicial task for a Court of last resort is the balancing of values which necessarily go into close constitutional decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3007.221" offset="12132289">In that regard, I want to point out that radio communication is increasingly a part of police work and that's particularly true in these narcotics cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.609" offset="12177847">A typical narcotics case involves undercover agent who makes contact to make a purchase, he goes to a street corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.364" offset="12208880">He is picked in a car by someone he doesn't know, who takes him around the city and they drive for maybe sometimes several hours while they try to throw off a tail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.247" offset="12252348">They then go to an apartment he didn't know about and there he meets somebody that he never saw before and negotiates his purchase and usually, they have to send out and get the narcotics and bring it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.464" offset="12301249">And a proper working of that by the police just requires a radio communication that takes a squad from four to seven men to investigate that situation, may have to have communication coming out of the informant who is negotiating the sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.605" offset="12385782">I suppose sometimes, it might have a matter of more than a passing interest to the government agency to know whether one of its men was endangered too?</text>

            <text syncTime="3080.234" offset="12424338">That's exactly right, Your Honor, because this is a very dangerous business and especially for the man who is negotiating the purchase and they need that to ensure his safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.981" offset="12479300">In addition, our help and should, they need it for, to permit the proper timing of the arrest and then they also needed for, it's very valuable in following a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.322" offset="12544711">If an informant has a radio – Kel radio on and they can follow the car at a much greater distance; they don't have to get so close to it in order to do the tailing and it protects the potential defendant against the informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.767" offset="12622451">In this type of police work, the person, who negotiates the sale, is often an addict himself and is maybe not the most reliable person in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.921" offset="12667068">And one of the things that the responsible officer wants to know is exactly what is happening and not just a secondhand version of it from an informant or purchaser who may not be too reliable.</text>
