            <text syncTime="42.323" offset="272636">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.361" offset="284757">The issue in this case is whether Davis versus United States or Fay versus Noia, sets the applicable standards for determining access to federal habeas corpus relief for a state defendant whose lawyer failed to make a timely challenge to the grand jury which indicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.788" offset="350481">Our position is that Davis does not apply to this case, but if this Court holds that Davis does apply, then Francis has met the test of Davis which his cause shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.940" offset="395099">He has met that test because of the ineffective assistance of counsel which he received.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.891" offset="414847">Obviously, the facts of this case are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.193" offset="424042">They are largely undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.981" offset="435223">Francis was indicted on December 10, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.683" offset="450060">He was 17-years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.553" offset="457479">He was indicted on the charge of felony murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.083" offset="467614">The maximum penalty in Louisiana for felony murder was death.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.315" offset="484542">A lawyer was appointed to represent Francis two months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.850" offset="498752">That lawyer is Mr. A. P. Turow (ph) of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.680" offset="514008">Turow was appointed and if he were going to file a grand jury challenge on the basis of exclusion of blacks, he would have had to file that challenge by March 4, 1965 which was three days after the end of the term of the grand jury which indicted Francis.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.043" offset="579523">Turow did not file that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.546" offset="589450">Indeed, Turow filed no motion in this case until the day before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.475" offset="609198">Turow recognizing his own inexperience associated with himself another lawyer from New Orleans, Mr. Amadi (ph).</text>

            <text syncTime="167.172" offset="771993">He associated with Mr. Amadi, according to Mr. Amadi because he was inexperience in handling criminal cases because of the fact that he had not handled a capital case in 15 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="197.599" offset="893724">We are talking about the whole series of events which we think support the proposition that he did not do the job that he should have done in protecting Francis’ rights.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce S. Rogow</label>
            <text syncTime="224.159" offset="999990">We think it is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.274" offset="1004379">Obviously the stakes in a capital case are very high and quite frankly the acceptance of an appointment in a capital case, if this were your first capital case is one which I think the lawyer ought to take with great consideration and give some thought to it, if you are going to do it by himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.489" offset="1065296">Turow obviously felt he could not do it by himself and he associated counsel with himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.257" offset="1084313">That counsel is Mr. Amadi who was associated as a trial expert because of Turow’s feeling I believe himself that he was inexperienced.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="278.398" stopTime="285.505">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="278.398" offset="1216911">Now, what we are doing, these questions are going to the merit of the standards that you set up?</text>
            <text syncTime="284.417" offset="1240943">They are your standards.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_s_rogow" startTime="285.505" stopTime="655.422">
            <label>Mr. Bruce S. Rogow</label>
            <text syncTime="285.505" offset="1245332">Yes sir and the standards are based on the totality of the circumstances in this case, not merely on the fact that it had been 15 years since he last handled a capital case, but that is one factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.807" offset="1286501">Another factor is that no motion was filed until the day before trial and that first motion that was filed in this case on the day before trial, June 23 was a motion for continuance on a form borrowed from the District Attorney’s office which was struck through by Mr. Turow to accommodate it for Francis’ use.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.786" offset="1362465">That motion for continuance filed as I said just the day before trial, the very first motion filed in this capital case saw the continuance so that Turow could have time to file additional motions in Francis’ defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.744" offset="1410321">The motion for continuance was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.723" offset="1418158">On that same day, three other motions were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.363" offset="1428712">One was a Prayer for Oyer which is a form of discovery under Louisiana Law, another motion for Bill of Particulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.288" offset="1452431">The third was a motion challenging the grand jury indictment only on vagueness grounds and of course it did not involve the exclusion of black question.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.015" offset="1487330">Now, our position is that the fact that those motions were filed the day before trial is just one more factor to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.508" offset="1517319">The form of those motions, on a form borrowed from the District Attorney, at least the motion for continuance was borrowed from District Attorney, is one more factor to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.963" offset="1555144">On the day of trial, a fourth motion was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.837" offset="1566638">That motion was one to suppress the statements which Francis had allegedly given.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.181" offset="1583983">The motion to suppress was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.526" offset="1589417">It was denied without a hearing and the record of this case reflects that no exception was taken to that denial without a hearing, although an exception was required under Louisiana Law and so one more example of the factors which we say taken in their totality begin to speak of ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.484" offset="1661201">Francis was tried on June 24, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.651" offset="1673949">He was convicted on that day and five days later, he was sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.416" offset="1692966">He was sentence to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.647" offset="1701848">There was no appeal taken from that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.193" offset="1712088">The record is clear that Francis knew of his right to an appeal, wanted an appeal and yet no appeal was taken and one of the reasons that Mr. Amadi gave for not taking the appeal was that he and Mr. Turow did not want to make this case a life’s work.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.820" offset="1770602">They felt that the jury by sparing the life of Francis had done enough, and therefore, no appeal was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.907" offset="1802890">Now, what we are saying is all of those facts together begin to -- more than begin, all of those facts together show that Francis’ counsel was ineffective and did not offer him the kind of protection which ought to have been offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.368" offset="1860777">So any presumption of the effectiveness was overcome by these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.658" offset="1885959">Francis later applied to the Louisiana Trial Court for habeas corpus, claiming that he was denied his right to appeal and also claiming that blacks have been excluded from the grand jury which indicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.700" offset="1938099">The application was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.272" offset="1944369">It was denied essentially because Francis had not made a timely challenge and under the applicable Louisiana Statute, if one did not make a timely challenge to the grand jury, then the right to challenge a grand jury was absolutely barred and because of that absolute forfeiture rule, Francis had no opportunity to raise this issue in state habeas corpus proceedings and to fully develop of whether or not there was any cause or whether or not he waived the right to challenge the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.131" offset="2063801">He then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus after the Louisiana Supreme Court that denied certiorari on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.612" offset="2089714">The District Court for this in the District of Louisiana granted Francis' petition for writ of habeas corpus, finding that Francis did not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to be indicted by a fairly constituted grand jury, Finding any alternative that if the test with that of Davis cause shown then Francis had met that test by virtue of the inexperience of his counsel in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.105" offset="2199742">The Court also found the grand jury which indicted Francis did indeed exclude blacks and they vacated the indictment, set aside the conviction and ordered the state to re-indict and retry Francis if it so desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.416" offset="2244986">The state appealed to the Fifth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit held that the Davis test is the applicable test, not the Fay versus Noia test.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.070" offset="2275601">But it held that the Davis test in this case because of the absolute forfeiture rule in Louisiana, would require Francis to show prejudice, not cause which is what Davis speaks of, but prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.936" offset="2323040">Now, the Fifth Circuit has taken two positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.874" offset="2334847">When there have been state rules which parallel Rule 12 (b) (2), the Fifth Circuit has said that a state defendant must show cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.052" offset="2367552">But in Louisiana because the rule is one of absolute forfeiture, the Fifth Circuit said that Francis must show more than cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.881" offset="2398795">He must show actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.822" offset="2410602">Our position is first, that Davis does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.466" offset="2425126">Davis does not applied because it turns upon the fact that Congress by adapting Rule 12 (b) (2) of the Federal Rules of criminal procedure set a new standard for determining waiver and that standard is one of cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.143" offset="2479879">So, Congress' action vis-a-vis 2255 is what Davis turns upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.081" offset="2503598">There is no analogous provision regarding 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.364" offset="2520734">Congress has not in any way limited access under 2254, except by the exhaustion of state remedies requirement which is written into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.571" offset="2557619">So we say Davis does not apply, but if the Court would find that Davis does apply then we believe Francis has met the test of Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.653" offset="2593877">That test is one of cause because the rule speaks of cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.951" offset="2611118">Davis speaks of cause and one of the touchstones of cause is ineffective assistance of counsel and Francis’ counsel was ineffective, especially as to protecting this very basic constitutional right which he was entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.184" offset="2668065">The state has argued that the Davis test should apply because the interest of the state and the Federal government are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.451" offset="2705159">If the interest of the state and the federal government are the same then the test --</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.367" offset="4928806">Yes sir and Turow has since died of course, but the only explanation we have is that of Amadi in the case and so Amadi’s testimony has to be the testimony to be looked at in determining why the motion was not filed and what if anything Turow did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.422" offset="4988992">Of course our position is that Fay versus Noia provides the applicable standards, if we are right about Fay versus Noia, then the question of cause does not come into play at all and in this situation, it is quite clear that there was no knowing an intelligent waiver made by Mr. Francis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.514" offset="5057329">There is no deliberate bypass made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.375" offset="5064852">The record does not reflect a deliberate bypass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.437" offset="5073107">Strategic decision made by Francis nor even by Mr. Turow and if Fay versus Noia is a proper standard then Abraham Francis has met that test too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.021" offset="5107379">And we think it is a especially appropriate to use Fay versus Noia test in this case because the right that is involved here is a very important right, one recognized by the Court from Strauder versus West Virginia to Alexander versus Louisiana in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.784" offset="5170491">One that is embodied in a Federal Criminal Statute 18 U.S.C., Section 243 which makes it a federal offense to exclude blacks from grand jury and predatory processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.536" offset="5217407">And so we think that it is very important that a defendant have an opportunity, full and fair opportunity to raise this basic constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.092" offset="5251680">We think that the Fifth Circuit cut it short by imposing actual prejudice test, a test that places a state defendant in a much more difficult position than a federal defendant in Davis versus United States, that just cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.268" offset="5304343">The purposes of the Federal Habeas Corpus Act, passed in 1867, show that it was meant to implement the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments, ratified in 1865 and 1868 respectively and looking at that together with 18 U.S.C., Section 243, passed in 1875, it is quite clear that this right is an important right and Francis ought to have the opportunity to vindicate it in Federal Habeas Croups Proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.593" offset="5409668">And we believe that that he can vindicate it in Federal Habeas Corpus Proceedings under Fay versus Noia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.839" offset="5430671">If Davis is applicable in this case, we believe he should have access under the cause shown test of Davis and he has met that test, and therefore, the Fifth Circuit was wrong in applying any harsh new test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.784" offset="5474452">We will reserve the balance of our time if indeed there is any left.</text>
