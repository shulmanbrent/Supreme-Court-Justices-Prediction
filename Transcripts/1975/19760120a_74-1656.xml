            <text syncTime="43.567" offset="277558">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.889" offset="298874">The consolidated appeals arise out of final judgment of a three-judge court of the District of Montana in two companion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.020" offset="347358">Both actions were filed by the Confederated Tribes of the Flathead Reservation and certain individual tribal members against the State of Montana and certain of its public officials seeking in the so-called cigarette case to enjoin the state from requiring a cigarette dealer’s license tax for Indian retailers and to enjoin the pre-collection of state cigarette taxes on cigarettes which were sold by these Indian retail dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.894" offset="498868">The other case, the personal property tax sought to enjoin the state from the collection of personal property taxes on property owned by tribal members residing within the Flathead Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.153" offset="563965">The three-judge court was convened under 28 U.S.C. 2284 and the Court by divided vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.790" offset="602522">Judge Smith dissenting in both cases held that that the Montana Cigarette Tax, the excise tax on dealers and on the sale of cigarettes themselves were in part invalid and then final injunction was entered against the State of Montana prohibiting the State from requiring a cigarette dealers license tax of the dealers on the reservation, and also enjoining the State of Montana from collecting the tax on sales of cigarettes to Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.447" offset="773154">The Court in the cigarette tax case also ruled that the State of Montana could require the pre-collection of the tax on sales of cigarettes made to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.477" offset="841281">In the personal property tax case, the collection of personal property taxes from individual Indian residents of the Flathead Reservation was enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.123" offset="891854">The state by these consolidated appeals has appealed from the portion of the judgment in both cases which enjoins the collection on the one hand of the cigarette tax and on the other the personnel property tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.350" offset="968758">Mr. Haddon, let me ask you something about the Montana Personal Property Tax for licensing vehicles and perhaps I can best put the question by telling you what I understand to be the Virginia Law which is the jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.019" offset="1091430">The tax is paid at one time, Mr. Justice Rehnquist but there is both a personal property tax on the vehicle itself and a separate fee for registration of the vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.527" offset="1281392">Primarily upon automobiles but also other types of personal property, cattle, farm equipment, items of that sort which are classified under Montana Law as personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.042" offset="1339488">These appeals raise the core issue to which this argument will be principally addressed of whether the immunity from state taxation in favor of Indian citizens on the Flathead Reservation are found by the District Court to be available and this additional immunity from state taxation which the tribes and their members seek with regard to sales of cigarettes to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.661" offset="1461950">Whether this immunity in its entirety in invalid and unconstitutional under the Due Process and Equal Protection concepts of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.359" offset="1508762">The Flathead Reservation in Northwestern Montana and from which these cases arise is a unique geographical area.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.621" offset="1549826">And as an Indian Reservation and as a part of Montana it is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.640" offset="1569888">In order to appreciate the factual concept, I would like to go in some detail to the facts which give rise to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.222" offset="1608236">The Flathead Reservation is approximately 1,250,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.474" offset="1629238">It comprises four parts of Montana Counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.129" offset="1651808">Polson, one of the county seats of Montana is located entirely within the confines of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.005" offset="1683364">It was created by the Treaty of Hellgate in 1855 from lands which were a part of the then Washington Territory and which of course later became the State of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.136" offset="1735818">In 1904, Congress enacted legislation which opened the reservation for allotment to individual Indians and for sale of surplus un-allotted lands to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.749" offset="1790362">As a result of this opening of the reservation, something over 400,000 acres were sold to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.222" offset="1820246">An additional 60,000 acres was granted to the state of Montana for school purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.844" offset="1846682">Other acreages were passed to religious institutions, to school and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.703" offset="1870087">So at the present time the mix on the reservation and so far as land ownership is concerned, is that over one-half of the land on the reservation is held in fee principally by non-Indian owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.050" offset="1939573">The balance of the reservation property something slightly less than one-half is held in part by individual Indians in trust title and in part of the tribes in tribal status.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.706" offset="2002163">The tribal lands as the record shows are being principally located and sparsely populated, foothill and mountain areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.703" offset="2038107">The Flathead reservation at the present time is a well-developed agricultural area.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.471" offset="2065170">It is an area with farms, ranches, communities scattered all over its inhabited parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.450" offset="2097144">It has an elaborate irrigation system which serves the farm and ranching communities and farming ranching areas which was created under congressional action in part and by use of state law and through use of the State Courts of the state of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.823" offset="2162659">And it is not and we think it is important, a place where Indian lives or Indians live alone or in isolation, they are scattered randomly throughout the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.916" offset="2218979">They live in integrated communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.387" offset="2228905">They participate in all of Indian or all of community activities and service.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.889" offset="2258894">There is no question to put it, it does remain a reservation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Sam E. Haddon</label>
            <text syncTime="543.428" offset="2277075">That is correct Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.677" offset="2286061">There is no issue on this appeal as to the continuation of the status of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.691" offset="2314065">There are approximately 18,000 people who live within the confines of this reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.443" offset="2337052">Less than 20% of whom are classified as Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.201" offset="2356174">The Indians themselves are ethnically mixed group of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.198" offset="2376132">Something over 4,000 are less than one-half Indian blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.669" offset="2406016">Some are small as 1/16 Indian blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.202" offset="2424092">Families themselves are mixed with one parent or one of the members of the family being an Indian or an enrolled tribal member, the other not being so.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.631" offset="2473830">In some instances, children of a particular family are in part tribal members and in part non-tribal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.559" offset="2513536">It remains however that the only way that one can claim status as an Indian is to be born as such within a requisite amount of Indian blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.372" offset="2568811">The Indian citizen on the Flathead Reservation participates in all facets of community life.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.353" offset="2604755">They vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.139" offset="2607890">They hold office.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.054" offset="2611547">They have access to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.216" offset="2620220">They attend schools provided by the State of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.351" offset="2640700">In short, they are totally integrated into the society of the area and they all participate in all aspects of citizen life of the State of Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.636" offset="2721888">The tribes themselves lease land to the individual Indian plaintiffs where the smoke shops were erected and took action to file the instant case after the state of Montana attempted to preclude the sale of the cigarettes without tax stamps affixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.682" offset="2830035">The personal property tax suit was likewise instituted following refusal of the State of Montana to omit the Indian citizens from payment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.125" offset="2907776">We suggest that the approach which is taken by the tribes and by the individual Indian citizens in this case seeks to draw what amounts to a line around a portion of the State of Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.579" offset="2973604">And to say that if a particular individual citizen of the state is a member of a particular ethnic or racial groups that is an Indian and that if he resides within that area, then he must not pay taxes to the Sate of Montana.</text>

            <text syncTime="756.219" offset="3128249">Indeed, it is not as it existed for over 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.877" offset="3158865">Our position is not with standing the existence of the Flathead Reservation is that this treatment of Indian citizens for tax purposes differently form other citizens of the State of Montana cannot be carried into practice without creating a conflict between the requirements of Equal Protection and Due Process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment and the particular practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.984" offset="3279237">The practice as we see it allows the Indian citizen to have and to continue to receive all of the benefits of citizenship of the state and yet not be responsible for the fair share of burdens of that citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.187" offset="3344021">We suggest that this Court has already considered the question of benefits versus burdens or benefits and burdens as a part of role of citizenship in the Oklahoma Tax Commission case and the facts are not unlike the facts which are before the Court in this case and there the Court noted that tax exemptions were not to be granted by implication and that the tax which was sought to be imposed by the State of Oklahoma was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.094" offset="3491665">We suggest that the reasoning and analysis found to be applicable in that case is equally applicable to the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.876" offset="3526878">We suggest that constitutional issues aside that the facts of the Oklahoma Tax Commission case are better suited, are fit more precisely with the facts of the case at bar than under the facts in McClanahan.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.744" offset="3590303">In McClanahan there was little interaction between the Indian community and the non-Indian community.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.445" offset="3625098">The Navajos lived apart on a separate reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.310" offset="3640563">There was by Williams versus Lee, no state responsibility toward those Indian citizens although the opinion of the Court in McClanahan indicates that there was some extension of state services and some state responsibilities toward those Indian residents of the Flathead, of the Navajo Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.280" offset="3732409">In McClanahan, there was no opening of the reservation to ownership of land by non-Indians and no general occupancy of that area by non-Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.727" offset="7474189">I think perhaps we can approach this argument by noting one or two matters at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.422" offset="7496967">The 1970 census prepared by the Department of Congress shows that there are 115 Reservations in the United States which are recognized by the secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Congressional authority contained in the Indian re-organization or Wheeler-Howard Act as it is properly known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.606" offset="7573767">In addition, that in fiscal 1975, the United States spent through federal appropriations $766 million in pursuant to its Federal Policy on Indians and Indian affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.840" offset="7646701">In 1790, the United States enacted its first statute with 18 Indians, the Indian Non-Intercourse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.334" offset="7676690">The United States has been imminently involved in Indian affairs from then down to this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.740" offset="7702290">We have under Flathead Reservation a situation whereby virtue of the historical development and certain Congressional activities an integrated reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.258" offset="7740324">We do not have and the counsel for the state has been unable to point to a single case or a single legal ruling or a single Federal statute which would say the Flathead Reservation and the question of State Jurisdiction as it applies to Indians on that reservation is any different than in the cases involving the Navajo Reservation such as McClanahan, the Navajo reservation such as Williams v.

Lee, Warren Trading Post, Kennerly, Mescalero Apache disposed off this issue with the exception for the one decision by the Court below holding that the State of Montana could force tribal members residing on the reservation to pre-collect the personal property tax that is owed by the non-Indian purchaser when he purchases from a tribal smoke shop as they are called. We do not believe and we believe that McClanahan v. Arizona settled that question that the state cannot force a tribal member to collect a cigarette tax owed by a non-member and for which a non-member is guilty of a state violation should he purchase and have in his property or in his possession such a cigarette tax and the state of Montana has criminal jurisdiction over that non-Indian should he violate the State Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.924" offset="8346992">The Supreme Court of Washington upon remand from this Court determined that the pre-collection requirement did not violate the constitutional statutory rights of the Indians on the call of reservation.</text>
