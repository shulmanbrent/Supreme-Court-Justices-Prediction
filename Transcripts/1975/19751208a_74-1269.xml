            <text syncTime="29.280" offset="220389">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.827" offset="238570">In July of 1971, the Police Commissioner of Suffolk County amended the rules and regulations of the Suffolk County Police Department, concerning certain grooming regulations for the members of the police force.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.416" offset="293009">In substance, the rule stated that members of the force should be neat and clean at all times and that male personnel should comply with grooming standards in respect to hair.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.260" offset="344313">Hair on the head should be neat, cleaned and trimmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.316" offset="356539">It should not touch the ears or the collar and the hair in front of the head should be groomed so that it does not fall below the band of properly worn headgear.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.574" offset="401574">In no case would the bulk or length of the hair interfere with the proper wear of any authorized headgear.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.259" offset="428323">The grooming regulation also mentioned sideburns that they should be neatly trimmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.984" offset="451207">With respect to mustache, a short and neatly trimmed mustache may be worn.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.807" offset="470537">As to beards and goatees, the face should be clean-shaven.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.737" offset="490286">Wigs are also mentioned in the regulation that an individual may wear a wig for cosmetic reasons to cover natural baldness, if he so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.271" offset="552353">This regulation was to take effect August 1, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.554" offset="573564">On August 4, 1971, an action was commenced in -- in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District in New York basically for a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction enjoining the Suffolk County Police Department from enforcing such a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.655" offset="633959">The plaintiff’s complaint in that case stated that the mere existence of the regulation violated his First Amendment right of free expression and the second aspect is that the regulation violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the constitution of the United States because no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without Due Process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick A. Sweeney</label>
            <text syncTime="260.648" offset="1145855">Yes and the issue is before this Court of whether or not the length of hair, whether it is on the head or facial or a combination of both is a First Amendment right and if it is -- or does it fall within a -- at least penumbra of the First Amendment and if it is not under the First Amendment, does it fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.272" offset="1244389">Third, if it does fall within either one of these amendments, is it a substantial right equivalent to, for instance, free speech or is it an ingredient of personal liberty which though not substantial, is nevertheless a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.441" offset="1313038">And lastly, as applied to police officers in Suffolk County, does the -- the state’s interest in effect of law enforcement by uniformed police -- appearance of police officers outweigh the individual’s right to govern his personal choice of appearance?</text>
            <text syncTime="320.475" offset="1385241">Now, when the case first came before the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York, it was basically on papers and affidavits submitted to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.767" offset="1422335">Chief Judge Mishler in that case, dismissed the complaint, stating basically that the Suffolk County Police Department, because it was quasi-military in character that -- and that uniformity of dressing, grooming are essential to effect the law enforcement, the complaint was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.969" offset="1503210">On appeal, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, stating in substance that there should have been -- a hearing or some testimony concerning the state’s interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.394" offset="1544901">They did while stating that they held no view on the merits, they did state that hair in and off itself presents a substantial constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.084" offset="1583667">They stated that the length of hair was an ingredient of an individual’s personal liberty and that personal liberty is not composed simply of the freedom held to be fundamental, but includes the freedom to act on less significant personal decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.125" offset="1651794">After a hearing before Chief Justice Mishler, he more or less reversed what he had stated before, feeling himself bound by what the Second Circuit had reiterated in terms of quasi-military, and stated that uniformity of police officers and safety of police officers are not legitimate state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.331" offset="1740611">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion and of course we are here before this Court on a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.795" offset="1774465">First with reference to whether or not if it is substantive right?</text>

            <text syncTime="429.812" offset="1822531">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.523" offset="1825352">In Greenwald against Frank, the state -- the highest court of the State of New York, the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the Appellate Division, Second Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.864" offset="1862759">They squarely ruled on an issue which was before the Nassau County -- which was a similar regulation in Nassau County which is the sister country of Suffolk County.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.809" offset="1946560">That is correct also and -- and that is both in this case and with respect to fireman, those were the cases decided after the Court of Appeals of the State of New York had ruled that with respect to police officers, the issue was one of a modest regulation because the Suffolk County Police Department was quasi-military in character that there was not a substantial federal question present.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.506" offset="2069336">What constitutes a neat appearance in the opinion of the Police Commissioner of Suffolk County should be left to the discretion of the police commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.730" offset="2114266">The length of hair in and off itself does not rise to basic constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.571" offset="2141642">Substantive constitutional rights and liberty should only be recognized by this Court wherefundamental liberties are at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.255" offset="2172362">Certainly, this Court has seen fit to go beyond the literal language of the Bill of Rights by defining such rights as right of privacy, but we do not have that issue present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.722" offset="2222204">The burden should not be on the stake here that Suffolk County Police Department to show that this regulation is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.220" offset="2256163">They should be in a regulation of this type, a presumption of constitutionality.</text>

            <text syncTime="569.559" offset="2381551">I think that is what was done in Greenwald against Frank and I think that is what should have been done in this case and that was the proper way to decide because that can always be tested for reasonableness in a state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.678" offset="2574021">They would have the burden of showing arbitrariness at that point and I think that is the better approach and this -- this regulation is no different from any other regulation that may be part of the rules and regulations of the Suffolk County Police Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.027" offset="2711425">If you look at the underlying reasoning in both circuits, they both do not define the length of hair as a substantial constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="667.167" offset="2771925">Certainly, it is not enumerated in the constitution, but they lend -- both speak in terms of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.070" offset="2803585">In that respect, they both place the burden of proof upon, in this case, the Suffolk County Police Department, to show a legitimate state interest reasonably related to the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.391" offset="2852904">In respect to a police officer, he certainly is the most visible representative of government that we have in this country today.</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.628" offset="4521816">The first police department was established in New York City in 1844 not by right of the United States Constitution or the New York State Constitution, but local laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.316" offset="4576568">After that many police departments were formed and the first laws, declaring police departments or policeman quasi-military were in the 1880s, Masterson versus French in New York, 1888; McAuliffe versus City of New Bedford, 1880s; Massachusetts; Hart versus Board of Fire Commissions, 1880, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.458" offset="4681162">Thereafter these cases became the leading cases cited in both State and Federal Courts throughout the country that policeman are quasi-military.</text>

            <text syncTime="1158.956" offset="4739154">It was not until this Court said in Garrity that policemen, like teachers and lawyers are not relegated to worded down versions of constitutional rights and it was finally the Dwen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.143" offset="4819925">This case that said policemen are not quasi-military.</text>

            <text syncTime="2159.617" offset="8741740">For instance, if the hair is a little bit over the ears, is that a problem too?</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.410" offset="8756996">I think you have to leave that to the discretion to the discretion of the police commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.286" offset="8772460">Let him set reasonable standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.056" offset="8779566">If they are unreasonable and I think he could promulgate even if this Court held that he had such a right, there is a possibility at some place in this country a police commissioner could make an unreasonable regulation, but I think a court would strike that down, for that reason as being unreasonable.</text>
