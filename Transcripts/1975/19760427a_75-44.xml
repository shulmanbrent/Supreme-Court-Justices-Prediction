            <text syncTime="41.951" offset="271055">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.070" offset="287565">The cases here today are consolidated, three cases dealing with three inmates of the Maryland state Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.642" offset="313896">One is McCray, one is Mr. Stokes, the other is Mr. Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.942" offset="335107">We will give a few facts with respect to Mr. McCray since that was the only case that was decided on its merits by the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.115" offset="371783">The only common issue with respect to Mr. Stokes and Washington is the single issue as to whether or not the exhaustion of state administrative remedies is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.635" offset="421834">McCray is now confined in the Maryland Penitentiary, serving 28 years for having -- been guilty of four counts of assault with intent to Murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.749" offset="466242">During the first four years of his confinement, he filed 37 Civil Rights action in the Federal District Court in Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.843" offset="506680">Thereafter, he filed additional Civil Rights actions so there are now 55 actions that have been filed by Mr. McCray.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.016" offset="543356">8 of which deal with habeas corpus relief and the balance of which deal the Civil Rights relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.013" offset="567388">Until the Circuit Court in this case, which we say wrongly, gave some remedy to Mr. McCray, not anyone of his petitions gave him any relief whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.429" offset="620991">Judge Field of the Fourth Circuit in his dissent described McCray from his litigious history as a chronic trouble maker and malcontent who was engaged in a ceaseless array of frivolous civil suits at public expense based upon allegations that have already been repeatedly found worthless and I would say that as of today the civil actions that have been filed by Mr. McCray have caused the state of Maryland something in excess of $350,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.040" offset="739483">McCray alleges deprivation of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights in 1971 in two separate occurrences, a month apart, alleging improper punishment, illegal conditions of confinement and denial of medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.027" offset="803431">The Fourth Circuit declared that the condition of McCray’s two days solitary confinement, resulting from his disturbance and misconduct, violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.997" offset="991303">The Fourth Circuit remanded the issue on monetary damages and the qualified immunities of the prison guards to the District Court for further determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.001" offset="1027352">But in our view it is unnecessary for this Court to reach the merits of the McCray case, and therefore, we will not deal further with the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.824" offset="1058595">We submit that the District Court of Maryland was correct in its threshold determination that the widely recognized principles of exhaustion of state administrative remedies required the respondents in these cases to present their complaints concerning the conditions and circumstances of their confinement, first to the Maryland Grievance Commission before approaching the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.894" offset="1150859">The Maryland inmate Grievance Commission procedure is an adequate and an effective state administrative remedy and the decisions of this Court do not, in our view, hold that where there is an adequate administrative remedy, a litigant may seek relief in the Federal Courts without first exhausting that administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.751" offset="1230271">We believe that this view is implicit in Mr. Justice Douglas' comments in Bicknese.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.262" offset="1256394">In that particular case, he stated, moreover it is by no means clear that Illinois Law provides petitioners with an administrative remedy sufficiently adequate to preclude prior resort to a Federal Court for protection of their Federal Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.072" offset="1319610">And I might say that this particular quote immediately followed the citation of the opinion of this Court in Lane versus Wilson in 307 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.237" offset="1372273">We believe that Lane versus Wilson, the predecessor of the Monroe, specifically held by implication, if not by direct holding, that where there was an effective state administrative remedy that this must be exhausted before a 1983 suit, maybe unattained by the Federal Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.031" offset="1631408">This was done for his own protection, but if the Administrative Grievance Commission were to have made the determination that this was improper, they could have issued directions which would be binding upon the agency to correct that condition.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="francis_b_burch" startTime="484.414" stopTime="1223.910">
            <label>Mr. Francis B. Burch</label>
            <text syncTime="484.414" offset="2040903">It certainly would not have the right to impose that burden on the state unless it involved the impingement of a Constitutional Right, it would seem to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.270" offset="2088342">I might say also that Mr. Justice Harlan in Damaco read the majority opinion at least to hold that is a requirement of exhaustion that the requirement of exhaustion of an adequate state remedy was condemned in Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.749" offset="2150304">In the 90 years prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, the 90 years that passed between then and the holding in Monroe, this Court and the lower Federal Courts assumed it with good reason that exhaustion principles applied in 1983 action where there was an adequate administrative state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.094" offset="2231702">Furthermore as early as 1886, this Court Ex parte Royale decided that a state prisoner seeking federal habeas corpus relief under what is now Section 2254, could first be required in the discretion of the Court to apply to the state Court for such relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.850" offset="2310696">This specific mandatory requirement by the way was not written into Section 2254 by the Congress until 1948, some 62 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.662" offset="2353955">And certainly what was true under Royale as to the predecessor of Section 2254, should be equally be as applicable in 1983 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.645" offset="2397840">Next to life itself, the most cherish right guaranteed by the constitution is that of a person’s right to his freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.257" offset="2432322">This Court has held in legions of cases that property and other rights are insignificant in comparison to one's right to his liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.631" offset="2465863">If this be the case then by what possible logic can it be said that state administrative remedies need be exhausted before one can evoke Federal Court Jurisdiction to seek relief from alleged illegal incarceration, while those same remedies need not be exhausted with respect to alleged conditions of confinement such as food, privileges, censorship etcetera, to ask the question, we submit is to answer it or more simply stated has this Court said in the past that the state can be trusted with the most precious of all person's rights his liberty, but yet cannot be trusted with this property rights and other privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.988" offset="2647258">We certainly think this is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.331" offset="2660632">Monroe simply held that the right to litigate in the state Courts could not deprive a citizen of his right to immediate recourse to the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.935" offset="2703055">But in so holding, this Court specifically noted, that one of the three main purposes of 1983 was to provide a Federal remedy whether state remedy though adequate in theory, was not available in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.726" offset="2766167">As this Court knows the doctrine of Monroe was extended two years later in Bicknese a School System case to a questionable administrative remedy as contrasted with the judicial remedy in Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.892" offset="2818830">In Bicknese, Justice Douglas, suggested for the first time that the Court's Supplementary language in Monroe actually represented a fourth purpose, but as Judge Noel in Anger Egnar versus Texas City said to read the Court's supplementary language as creating a fourth and virtually unlimited occasion for the application of the Section 1983 would render superfluous Monroe’s extensive previous discussion of the second and the third Statutory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.722" offset="2962190">Then 8 years after Bicknese in a majority per curiam opinion in Willwording, a statement appears and I might say without more that an inmate need not first seek questionably available administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.867" offset="3018719">We submit, however, that as the dissenters did in the Fourth Circuit, this loose Statement from the per curiam Willwording holding is based upon a faulty reading of the predecessor cases and should not and does not represent the state of the existing Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.037" offset="3083398">Moreover the unanimous views of all 7 of the Circuit Court Judges below reflected a deep disenchantment with a non-exhaustion rule followed and applied only because they said we had no alternative and the exhortation that this Court reexamine and modify its earlier decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.756" offset="3166363">We would hope that reexamination will result in a clarification of the per curiam Willwording holding in favor of a narrower and more accurate reading of the sixth-three majority opinion in Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.959" offset="3219130">Such a clarification we submit is similar to the one undertaken by this Court in 1973, in Miller versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.566" offset="3257582">There it was stated that the Ross test of obscenity had been drastically altered in 1966 by the plurality opinion in Memoirs versus Massachusetts so as to require prosecutors to prove a negative that the material is utterly without redeeming social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.266" offset="3328322">Following this Court's opinion in Memoirs, a multitude a per curiam opinions breathed life into the orderly without redeeming social value test and thereby seem to establish that as a basic test which was there that -- as a basic test which was there to consider controlling in numerous lower court decisions under the doctrine which we call creeping stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.101" offset="3435738">The Miller decision, however, finally returned the case law in this area to its proper and established path.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.485" offset="3465204">As this Court was sure enough of its questionable role as a super sensor and as the Lower Courts were sure enough of their roles as statures by the reexamination and clarification of Memoirs by Millers.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.596" offset="3517658">So also would this Court only be shoring up the role of super warden by a proper clarification of Monroe and its progeny in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.574" offset="3557573">The same of course would apply to the role of the Lower Federal Courts as being the wardens of the various Institutions throughout this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.648" offset="3589860">The nature of the administrative remedy provided by the Legislature of Maryland makes the time and the setting, particularly right for reanalyzing and restating the law on this very thorny subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.519" offset="3641373">Maryland’s Inmate Grievance Commission presents this Court with a case of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.828" offset="3670631">Two of its members must be lawyers and two of its members must be experts in the field of correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.941" offset="3699052">The Commission is headed by an Executive Director who has a significant professional experience than significant professional assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.954" offset="3743147">Only those grievances or complaints which are wholly lacking in merit maybe dismissed without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.746" offset="3774285">All of the rest must be the subject of a hearing on the merits with a full penalty of due process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.689" offset="3802079">The commission must decide the matter promptly in a written order, containing findings of fact, delivered to the Secretary who must affirm, modify or reverse within 15 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.992" offset="3851293">If the action is favorable to the inmate, the Secretary is directed to implement the order and to take whatever action he deems appropriate in light of the commission’s findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.102" offset="3895702">If unfavorable, judicial review is immediately available to the inmate in the state Courts under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.426" offset="3929034">Surely it cannot be said that Maryland’s remedy is an adequate solely because it does not provide for money damages which are appropriate, which are really not appropriate or available in the vast majority of 1983 prisoner suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.303" offset="3984518">Meaningful relief in practically all such cases is achieved by declaratory or injunctive relief that is determination of an unconstitutional prison practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.234" offset="4028195">In the myriad category of cases where monetary damages maybe appropriate and available, the Federal Court could simply stay its hand until the completion of the administrative proceeding, thus, gaining the benefit of the record there made.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.583" offset="4089635">As the District Court below said in Washington, the short answer to this is that since the Commission has been invested with powers comparable to the equity power of a Federal Court, the prisoner will not be prejudiced by delaying an award of damages until the grievous procedures had been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.812" offset="4162569">Respondents have raised several objections to the adequacy of Maryland’s administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.308" offset="4184511">They say that 54% of the grievances filed are dismissed without a hearing as wholly lacking in merit and that in only 11.4% of the cases is the grievance found to be meritorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.609" offset="4233726">First of all we would note that 938 or 55% of the cases disposed of were disposed of administratively to the satisfaction of the inmate, generally through the offices of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.926" offset="4294957">And of the remaining 744 cases, a 191 were decided in favor of the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.247" offset="4328289">This represents a 66% favorable disposition, instead of the 11.4% as alleged by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.357" offset="4368727">We will also note that the Federal Court under Section 1915, possesses the identical authority to dismiss wholly frivolous in forma pauperis suits and respondents own statistics establish that only 4.9% of Federal Civil Right Suits ever reach trial and is not unlikely that an even lower percentage are ultimately disposed of favorably to the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.385" offset="4472799">Finally, respondents complain about the lapse of 24 weeks between the filing of the complaint and the final decision thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.315" offset="4504564">The actual time today, we would say, is 94.9 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.964" offset="4527133">The average time elapsing between the date of the filing of all grievances and all dispositions is only 40.6 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.735" offset="4562242">By contrast, the elapsed time in Federal Court between the filing of a 1983 prisoner suit and its ultimate disposition at the trial table is we understand some 24 to 36 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.457" offset="4617099">To comprehend the problem that Maryland has sought to be in the context of that problem, it is helpful to remember the language of Mr. Justice Stewart in Preiser (Inaudible) discussing the intimate day to day relationship of the inmate with the state comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.357" offset="4680733">The strong considerations of comity that require giving a state Court system that has convicted a defendant, the first opportunity to correct its own errors, that is also required giving the states the first opportunity to correct the errors made in the Internal Administration of their prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.345" offset="4752727">Mr. Justice Powell expressed similar concerns in Procunier and Mr. Justice Marshall in McCarthy if I may, I would like to quote from his language in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.489" offset="4837259">At page 1663, Mr. Justice Marshall said, “Certainly very practical notions of judicial efficiency come into play as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.347" offset="4876652">A complaining party maybe successful in vindicating his rights in the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.817" offset="4898595">If he has required to pursue his administrative remedies, the Courts may never have to intervene and notions of administrative autonomy required that the agency be given a chance to discover and correct its own errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.522" offset="4949377">Finally it is possible that frequent and deliberate clouding of administrative processes could reek in the effectiveness of an agency by encouraging people to ignore its practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.216" offset="6800205">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.002" offset="6815356">The state of Maryland is asking the Court for a decision on the broad question of whether a Maryland prisoner maybe required to exhaust state administrative remedies in an action properly bought under 42 U.S.C. 1983, alleging violations of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.161" offset="6875960">The fundamental defect in the state's argument is that the asserted remedy, the Maryland inmate Grievance Commission is not an adequate administrative remedy under the circumstances of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.019" offset="6919323">In addition the state misconceives the proper role of this Court in asking that an exhaustion requirement be judicially grafted on to the Civil Rights Act of 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.459" offset="6961119">Whether the exhaustion administrative remedies doctrine is to be made applicable to 1983 cases is a matter for Congress and not the Courts to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.774" offset="7002392">The cases before the Court do not present a proper vehicle for a ruling on a broad constitutional question urged by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.472" offset="7029142">The facts require only a holding that there is no adequate administrative state remedy for these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.840" offset="7054637">Even in the case where exhaustion, even in the case where the exhaustion doctrine is recognized to apply, exhaustion is not required if the proposed remedy is found to be inadequate or if the purposes of the doctrine will not be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.674" offset="7101971">These cases present exactly that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.935" offset="7115032">First with regards to Milton McCray separate actions against Mr. Burrell and Mr. Smith, the only relief sought by McCray in these cases is damages for being subjected to violations of his Eighth and Fourteenth amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.483" offset="7169262">As the Attorney General pointed out McCray does request damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.428" offset="7189011">However, he was incorrect in stating that McCray requested declaratory and injunctive relief in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.304" offset="7212521">If I may refer the Court specifically to the appendix, pages 12 and 16 are McCray’s per se complaints, page 22 is his amended complaint in Burrell, page 43 and 137 are the opening statements by council at the evidential hearings and both of those cases and all that indicates clearly that the only request being made by McCray in those cases was for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.340" offset="7308652">I believe when his original per se complaint was filed in one of the cases, he requested injunctive relief because at that time he was being subjected to the conditions he was complaining about, but by the time the case came to trial it was quite evident that the only issues before the District Court had to do with damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="3094.481" offset="12481210">I do know that as far as the most recent performance of the Grievance Commission in the supplemental brief that we filed, we indicated recent statistics that indicate in only one out of a hundred cases of prisoner complaints does the Grievance Commission grant relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.104" offset="12539725">Now that relief is granted after a hearing and after final review by the Secretary, that is during the past four months period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.552" offset="12573475">Earlier and this is reflected in the record for the case and it is on page 80 of our brief, the Attorney General made reference to the allegation that the grievance commission informally resolves many of the complaints that come before them, and therefore, there is no need for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.488" offset="12641289">However, in discovery in this case we asked the Executive Director about specific cases over I believe a 90-day period which he described is a typical day, a typical period of time for the Commission and during that period of time there were 45 complaints administratively dismissed and only four of those were complaints they were informally resolved to the satisfaction of the inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.219" offset="12724149">So we would suggest that of that 55% or 65% of the cases which are administratively dismissed only a very small percentage of those, perhaps 10% or less are actually resolved to the satisfaction of the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.923" offset="12779006">That when added to the fact that only 1% of those which ultimately go to a hearing indicates a very, very low number of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.229" offset="13192263">The facts of these cases are set forth in the brief and basically the important facts are that McCray was thrown -- placed into isolated confinement on two separate occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.579" offset="13241582">The conditions of isolated confinement in one case, the Burrell case were particularly severe and more so than in the Smith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.036" offset="13267391">In that situation he was placed in a small cell naked without any bedding, without any mattress, the cell was cold, there was no toilet in the cell, he was denied all elements of personal hygiene for two-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.840" offset="13318696">He was even denied toilet paper during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.954" offset="13331130">His toilet was at 6 to 8 inch in diameter hole in one corner of the cell with an iron grating over which was encrusted with the excrement of prisoners who would been in that cell before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.235" offset="13372195">He remained there for two days without ever receiving any kind of counseling, medical attention or professional help from a psychiatrist or a psychologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.013" offset="13407303">And the basis of our argument is that although there was perhaps reason to have placed McCray into an isolated confinement situation because he needed to be isolated from the rest of the population to avoid creating a disturbance and for his own protection, our claim is that the conditions of isolated confinement and the length of isolated confinement from McCray were arbitrary under the circumstances and a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.845" offset="13514719">The directive -- the regulation of the Maryland Prison System provided a liberty interest that McCray had in not being thrown into isolated confinement for arbitrary reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.445" offset="13561112">In addition to that Wolf versus McDonald seems to establish that some minimal form of due process is available to a prisoner before going into solitary confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.812" offset="13606565">Under these circumstances, we say that that McCray was not entitled to a Wolf versus McDonald hearing, but what we do say is that he was entitled to a minimum of procedure in order to assure that the conditions of confinement and the length of the confinement were necessary and we say that the rule of reasonableness in this case is Maryland Penitentiary's own Administrative Director.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.435" offset="13689008">That the Court of Appeals gave proper deference to Maryland Prison Officials by suggesting that that was the minimum constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.811" offset="13726520">In answer to the question posed earlier by, Your Honor, we are not suggesting that the mere violation of a state regulation arises -- raises a constitutional claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.083" offset="13771659">We are saying that first of all the regulation serves two purposes in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.672" offset="13789945">First of all, it establishes a liberty interest on the part of McCray, an interest that cannot be deprived without some kind of a minimal procedure to assure that it is not arbitrarily deprived and second the regulation provides a standard for what is minimally reasonable under the circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3757.903" offset="15134938">If that is Mr. Bennett’s opinion, that is his opinion, but we say that at least the Court ought to give the District Court the opportunity to make a determination as to whether or not the adequate -- the remedy is adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3786.246" offset="15248309">And we say that unlike what Mr. McCray’s Attorney has said, we say that actually there are four more -- far more cases where there are favorable decisions in favor of the inmate by virtue of the use of the Inmate Grievance provisions than there are otherwise because of the filing of the 1983 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.429" offset="15340991">I would ask the Court please to look at Lane versus Wilson in 307 U.S. which is not cited in our brief and Carrington versus Edwards in 264 F. 2nd because I think they give the background historically of what the 1983 cases permitted with respect to administrative remedy.</text>
