            <text syncTime="24.158" offset="199933">Mr. Andrews.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Melvin Andrews</label>
            <text syncTime="27.105" offset="211740">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.925" offset="226995">The City of Eastlake is located approximately 15 miles of East of Cleveland in the State of Ohio and it is has about 20,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.079" offset="263671">It is a city which operates under a charter type of government, which under the Ohio constitution grants to the city all rights of local self Government, and it grants to the people sovereign rights and so far, they do not conflict with the Ohio Constitution or general laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.435" offset="357085">The City of Eastlake had adopted a general zoning plan, some 25 years ago, in which the entire city is zoned into various districts for industrial business and residential use.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.110" offset="411733">The general zoning plan of the city of Eastlake did not under attack in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.102" offset="435766">In May of 1971, Forest City respondent herein asked or requested a rezoning of an eight acre parcel of land from a limited industrial use to a multiple family use for the purpose of building multiple housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.544" offset="505461">The record does not disclose the type of multiple housing rather it would be very expensive apartments or the lower economic variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.734" offset="546316">At any rate, the Planning Commission of the city of Eastlake approved this rezoning request and in the meantime, the voters by initiative petition had made an amendment to the Eastlake City charter requiring that before any rezoning of land becomes finally effective, it must be submitted to a 55% majority vote of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.971" offset="659165">Now, the City Council then approved the rezoning request of Forest city and under the Eastlake Charter Amendment, it was submitted for a vote of the people and failed to achieve or receive the 55% affirmative vote necessary for its passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.876" offset="730845">Forest City then applied to the Local Court of Common Pleas requesting injunctive relief and declaratory judgment asking that the Court declare the Eastlake Charter Amendment to be unconstitutional and the Court of Common pleas affirmed the Constitutionality of the Eastlake Charter Amendment and subsequently in the Court of Appeals – the Eastlake Charter Amendment was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.882" offset="826871">And then, in the Ohio Supreme Court, the decision was reversed and the Ohio Supreme Court found a reasonable use of property by rezoning may not be made dependent upon the potentially, arbitrary and unreasonable whims of the voting public without violating Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.204" offset="916106">It is important to note that the Ohio Supreme Court did not find the Eastlake Charter Amendment to violate the Ohio Constitution or the General Laws of the State of Ohio even though this was contended by the respondents throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.533" offset="977441">The issue in this case is whether the mandatory referendum voting procedure of the Eastlake Charter relative to rezoning constitutes unlawful delegation of legislative power to the electorate in violation of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.459" offset="1041180">I believe basically that the Ohio Supreme Court got the cart before the horse because the delegation as power is not from the council to the people but it is exactly the opposite under the charter and under the Ohio Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.217" offset="1100217">The power is given by the people to the council.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.440" offset="1113069">They can give as much of the power to the council as they desire or they can retain it onto themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.094" offset="1139714">Really, what is involved here, we believe is a struggle on a local issue between whether the final power of rezoning shall reside in the city council, or whether it shall reside in the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.145" offset="1199900">The Supreme Court has placed in jeopardy the final power of the people in respect to rezoning.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.322" offset="1268654">Now, the history of Ohio without exception has made a determination that rezoning a property is a legislative act and as such, subject to referendum.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.404" offset="1364994">The basic thinking is as long as the people have the initial right to enact zoning ordinances, then they also have the right of change.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.739" offset="1402297">Because if that were not so, then the final power of zoning would vest in the council and not in the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.766" offset="1430404">We believe, that my basic position is, this is just a pure local issue as to where that power should be vested.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Melvin Andrews</label>
            <text syncTime="352.301" offset="1512533">There are cases throughout United States where they have called rezoning, a Quasi-judicial Act or an administrative act and attempted to get around the referendum because the referendum even on Ohio is restricted to Legislative Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.176" offset="1576063">But the Ohio Supreme Court even in this case, found this to be a Legislative Act and cited the Ohio law which backs that up.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.677" offset="1634055">Is there any claim here that the existing use of the property, existing industrial zoning was an unreasonable classification?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Melvin Andrews</label>
            <text syncTime="391.119" offset="1667805">Absolutely not.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.211" offset="1676164">This is the basic problem here that there is no claim whatsoever that the existing zoning classification of the property, the industrial zone classification is any matter unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.215" offset="1736142">There is no claim that there is any economic damage to the respondent here by virtue of the failure of the city rezoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.631" offset="1765817">No, this property maybe equally valuable as industrial property, maybe more so than it would as multiple family zone housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.388" offset="1800925">There is no – nothing in the record to show that it would be good city planning to rezone the property as request.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.269" offset="1824435">In fact, the proposed parcel is located directly between industry and business zone property.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.433" offset="1853066">The very purpose or the reason that this came into being is that the respondent here is a very large developer property throughout the Ohio District, and the history has been such that they can go into a given community and exercise much power of control over the council and so the city of Eastlake residents felt rightly or wrongly that Forest City had too much sway over council and that council is making these decisions not because of what is good for the city but because of pressures and so forth what was good for Forest City.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.215" offset="1980230">And the very traditional concept of referendum, was to sort of counterbalance the wealthy and entrenched, so that the people could reserve themselves the power to in effect veto, the actions of their council if they did not like them.</text>

            <text syncTime="798.586" offset="3297637">That it is the procedure by which this is given to the people that they are arguing about.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.853" offset="3318744">They do not seem to say that there is anything wrong with having referendum on zoning matters as long as there is 10% petition circulated but the moment you eliminate that 10% petition and say it would be by automatic referendum then they say that is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.734" offset="3378303">But anyhow, really, this does not make that much change because in the zoning procedures under the Eastlake charter and this is traditional method, first of all it goes to the Planning Commission and then there is a public hearing for the Planning Commission, then it goes to the City Council as it plans a public hearing for city planning – City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.661" offset="3453954">This far, the amendment makes no change whatsoever, if City Council turns the change down it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.121" offset="3479867">It is only in the event that City Council approves the proposed rezoning that for the first time does this amendment come in to play and then it says before that decision of City Council becomes final then it must be approved by a majority vote of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.131" offset="3547890">Now, if we have a voter whose property of rezoning is destined to become a subject referendum by the 10% petition, it makes no difference at all other than the fact the electors have to circulate their 10% petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.589" offset="3605673">And in the other side of the defense, if it does make a difference, it might add as much as six months time to the application because you do have to submit it for a vote of the people and there is some delay involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.777" offset="3670457">I think we should at least mention because of Judge Stern’s decision that the record does not substantiate any claim of racial or economic discrimination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.908" offset="3723015">I believe that respondent will probably back me up.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.688" offset="3734091">There is no record in this case, whatsoever except for the charter and the applicable ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.968" offset="3759168">So, really, we are talking entirely about the constitutionality of the Eastlake procedure provided for rezoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.221" offset="3792187">It is a little unfortunate because in the Ohio Supreme Court, there was a housing unit that filed a brief which was far field from the record in this case and there they advocated the discrimination and impeding a right travel and so forth and Judge Stern in his concurring majority opinion picked up this kind of wording but I do not believe that the record in this case substantiates that and I do not believe it is basically a discrimination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.185" offset="3888109">As a practical matter, I believe that this case is pretty well governed by the finding of this Court in the Valtierra case rising out of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.845" offset="3930741">Almost the same arguments were made in that case even though that case applied to a public housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.196" offset="3956132">It was a Constitutional Amendment of the State of California requiring before any law in housing comes in any community, it is subject automatic referendum requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.193" offset="4008063">In the same case, the same arguments was made in here that people or the developers were entitled this 10% procedure type petition and there are the Judge Black, I believe in the ruling says that the referendum is a democratic decision making procedure which by ensuring at all people of community will have a voice in the decision which may lead in large expenditure.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.498" offset="4089356">Local government funds will increase public services.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.272" offset="4100432">So, it gives them voice in decisions, it will effect the development of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.051" offset="4115583">And, I think that is what we are saying here, that this is a means whereby the people have the constitutional right to reserve on to themselves the power in respect to rezoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.713" offset="4158215">Now, if rezoning was a power that was set aside by the Ohio Constitution and said no, you cannot vote on that, that be something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.541" offset="4181516">There are certain things such as Fiscal matter and tax matters which are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.441" offset="4197085">Rezoning is not one of them and rezoning has traditionally been subject to a vote of people and first of all adopting the general zoning plan and secondly, we feel that they have the power to adopt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1057.065" offset="4331564">The Supreme Court below and also the respondents here relied pretty much upon Roberge and this is a case way back in 1928 in which the Court held that a philanthropic home could not to be made a subject of voting by people located in the same block and also the Eubank case which was in 1912 and this is one which they attempted to establish building lines by adjacent neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.033" offset="4447443">And we believe that neither of these cases are correctly interpreted by the respondent or by the Ohio Supreme Court because these are neighborhood preference cases and they say that they can not have a vote of people, in neighborhood’s preference case unless there are established standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.108" offset="4511808">But even in those cases, in each case, the Court says the power to locate a philanthropic home, or the general part of the city located philanthropic home, we do not decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.284" offset="4552455">And in the other case, the power to establish building lines, we do not decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.737" offset="4570323">So these are the cases which were relied upon by the respondent and I think they are misinterpreted or mis-relied upon by the Ohio Supreme Court and this is exactly the wording which was used by District Court case of California, the Alameda Spanish Speaking case, which they said that these two cases were misinterpreted and were not a basis for a finding where the entire referendum power of the city is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3582.119" offset="14431756">The decision would be reviewable the same from the council or the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.162" offset="14447952">That type of case you look at the property and determine what the restrictions are in the property and whether decision made by council or people, makes no difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3596.449" offset="14489121">Secondly, I think Mr. Ginn’s position is he does not want the people to vote on rezoning and thirdly, in respect to the Eastlake charter, rezoning has always been a subject of referendum under the Eastlake charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.726" offset="14542202">The only difference being that under old system so we speak, it required a 10% petition of the people in order to bring the referendum to vote and the substantive rights are the same.</text>
