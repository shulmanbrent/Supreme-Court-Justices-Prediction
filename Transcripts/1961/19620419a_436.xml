            <text syncTime="27.627" offset="213870">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.059" offset="227558">Petitioner here was indicted for refusing to answer four the questions put to him by a subcommittee of the Committee on Un-American Activities on July 18th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.250" offset="284400">Prior to trial, petitioner's motion to dismiss counts 1, 2 and 4 of this indictment was granted and therefore, petitioner went to trial only on the remaining count, count 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.841" offset="346781">This count, I would like to read it briefly from brief as it appears at page 4, alleged the refusal to answer the following question.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.956" offset="399235">As a member of the Communist Party, when he, Mignon, was in the Communist Party, he said, "With you”, and in local term, he said that he sat in closed communist cell meetings with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.054" offset="451584">Now, I will ask you whether or not he was telling the truth or was he telling a falsehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.636" offset="477915">I would like to repeat again that this is the only count upon which petitioner went to trial and on which he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.563" offset="513651">I repeat what would appear to be obvious and repeat it again because this point seems to have escaped the court below completely which thought it was reviewing apparently a conviction on the counts which dismissed and I don't think the point is yet permeated to the Government, at least as far as I can see from its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.966" offset="595257">And I contend on the basis of the fact that we only have this count before the Court for review and these contentions really are we -- web into one another that this count 3 question was not pertinent to the announced subject under inquiry that the petitioner was given no explanation of the pertinency of that count, even though they objected to the pertinency of the count and finally related to these other points, the question had no legitimate legislative purpose and that there was no sufficient justification for the invasion of petitioner's privacy in First Amendment Rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.046" offset="819597">That appears, and if Your Honor would permit me, I would like to go into the context, the full context of the case and I will get to that point and read the exact language if I may defer that for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.764" offset="878425">Now first, I like to point out that these hearings were being held pursuant to a formal resolution which was adopted by the House Committee on Un-American Activities Committee on July 10th of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.116" offset="943835">And we have here what we do not normally have in inquiries by the House Committee on Un-American Activities and perhaps because of this Court's decision in Watkins case because these hearings were held shortly after it, we have an exact frame of reference as to what was that the Committee was concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.439" offset="1017083">I have set out for easy reference in my brief at page 4 the exact language of that resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.834" offset="1050728">And you will note that the purpose of the resolution was to investigate whether or not members of the Communist Party or persons subject to its discipline are employed in various media of communications and it goes on with the purpose of determining whether or not we need remedial legislation at the present time to combat dangers of espionage or sabotage in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.526" offset="1165458">According to the Staff Director of the Committee, Mr. Arens, who testified at the trial, was the only witness of the trial, petitioner had been subpoenaed as a witness in this case on the basis of information the Committee had obtained from a Mr. Michael Mignon.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.248" offset="1232332">Mignon, according to Mr. Arens, was one of several to use the parlance of the Committee, they have great deal of parlance which is peculiar to the Committee, was one of what is called a friendly and cooperative witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.533" offset="1341524">Some witnesses are classified as friendly and cooperative and others -- it's not peculiar but it's peculiar in the sense that they used this as their regular parlance.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.657" offset="1377991">I don't know that other people regularly describe witnesses in a formal classification, some being friendly and cooperative as Mignon was and as our particular petitioner here was described as unfriendly and uncooperative.</text>

            <text syncTime="335.302" offset="1444551">That's correct, in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.093" offset="1459702">According to the Staff Director, as a matter of fact, this witness Mignon, prior to these hearings had been interviewed in several times by the staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.345" offset="1496795">And it was only after that he was fully satisfied that he was a reliable witness, one who which they would have full confidence that they decided to put them on the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.487" offset="1541308">Now, Mignon testified on the first day of the hearing, these hearings opened up on July 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.181" offset="1568057">He testified that he and Mignon had been a member of the Communist Party from late 1936 to sometime in 1940 and that during most of this time, he had also been an officer of the American Communications Association, which is a labor union in this communications field.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.372" offset="1648828">And during the course of his testimony, he repeated for the public record a list of names which he had supplied to the Committee in executive session as people whom he had known as communist during this period and he included on that list the name of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.157" offset="1723956">Now, the petitioner was the first witness to go onto the stand on the following day, that is July 18th.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.918" offset="1747048">And although the Committee had never had any contact with the petitioner before, he was classified in this pigeonhole as being an unfriendly and uncooperative witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.847" offset="1786755">The petitioner relying on what was then the recent cases decided by this Court in Watkins and Sweezy, I believe they had been decided maybe six weeks before.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.727" offset="1834297">This hearing was in July of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.149" offset="1844015">He refused to answer questions as to whether he was a communist or knew of communist in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.181" offset="1876093">Now, the Staff Director and the Chairman of the Committee both pressed petitioner to answer to these questions, to answer the question as to whether he was now a communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.776" offset="1922487">And they went at some length to explain the pertinency of that particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.703" offset="1946206">And I think it's important in the light of the context and the fact that we have a different question before us, to read to you why the Committee said it wanted an answer to the question as to whether the petitioner was now a communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.572" offset="2001690">Well, I like to read, it's set out briefly at my brief at page 67 what he was told by the Staff Director, Mr. Arens, namely, “Mr. Grumman, if you are now a communist, you could tell this Committee at all probability of directives from the Communist Party to communist respecting the vital communications facilities of this nation” --</text>

            <text syncTime="501.612" offset="2109837">“If you are now a communist, you could tell this Committee of the techniques proposed by the Communist Party to cease the communications industry to intercept messages to sabotage communications in the event of war”.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.885" offset="2170964">Then the Chairman of the Committee added the following note, he said, he wanted to bring to the witnesses' attention the then recent decision of Judge Youngdahl, District Judge Youngdahl in the District Court of Columbia in your case of United States against Peck, in which he said that -- Judge Youngdahl there he said that the Communist movement now constitutes a criminal conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.034" offset="2263542">In the Peck case, Judge Youngdahl had made a sharp distinction between questions dealing with what he said was the past, pre-1950, which he said were not permissible questions to put to a witness but he said that the situation being roughly post-1950 might be different because since 1950, the patents of the Internal Security Act, the Communist movement was now a criminal conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.867" offset="2374823">Now after considerable colloquy back and forth, the petitioner made the point clear and he said he wanted to respond to the Committee and make it perfectly clear and he said as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.214" offset="2412231">He says, "I have no knowledge or information whatever of anybody who does or wants to conduct sabotage and espionage or illegal interceptions and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.490" offset="2461341">I know of no directives of anyone at all to do this kind of thing".</text>
            <text syncTime="594.288" offset="2480567">He also told the committee he never heard or knew of no directives of the Communist Party to obtain control of the American Communications Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.187" offset="2520168">At that point, the Staff Director announced that the staff interrogation of the witness was concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.773" offset="2554441">There was some further colloquy at which point, a prepared statement which the witness have been prepared or the aide of counsel was then read into the record although prior to that, the Committee have made a big point of refusing to let him refer to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="652.613" offset="2713788">The Chairman of the Committee, Congressman Doyle, then inquired of the two other members of the subcommittee whether they had any questions to put to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.607" offset="2749837">Both answered in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.740" offset="2758301">One member of the Committee Mr. Scherer added, "Have a motion to make is the witness excused".</text>
            <text syncTime="670.663" offset="2785991">The Staff Director again said, "I have no further questions".</text>
            <text syncTime="674.605" offset="2801768">And then it appears in the record that the conference was held by the members of the subcommittee and the staff, off the record and the subject of that conference does not appear on the record of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.220" offset="2848266">And it was immediately following that conference, after the Staff Director had said, “The staff interrogation was concluded", and after the witness had said that he had no information on any of the subjects which were the stated subjects of inquiry as set forth in the resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.638" offset="2917961">It was after all that happened that we get to a colloquy which lead to what is now count 3 in the basis of the indictment and the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.732" offset="2954324">I have set that out and I like to refer the Court to follow me now, my brief from page 9 to 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.097" offset="2983790">The Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Doyle said, "Witness and witness counsel, I am calling your attention to the fact that a few minutes ago, I believed I quoted verbatim the testimony of Mr. Mignon.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.624" offset="3037915">You are acquainted with him, are you?</text>
            <text syncTime="735.378" offset="3044916">You know who he is."</text>
            <text syncTime="736.533" offset="3049514">Mr. Grumman, "I have certainly met Mr. Mignon."</text>
            <text syncTime="739.849" offset="3062784">Mr. Doyle, "Certainly met him, well he said he met you."</text>
            <text syncTime="743.862" offset="3078771">Now on yesterday, he, a former admitted communist for several years in the same union of which you are now secretary-treasurer and at least you were one term president according to your own testimony, voluntarily named a number of the officers of the union before this Committee and he named you Frank Grumman, secretary-treasurer of A.C.A. Local 10 and Mr. Fraser was another member of the subcommittee and dispersed as a member of the Communist Party and Mr. Doyle took on, "As a member of the Communist Party, when he was in the Communist Party, he said with you and in local term, he said that he sat in closed communist cell meetings with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.895" offset="3247000">Now, I will ask you whether or not he was telling the truth or was he telling falsehood."</text>
            <text syncTime="792.048" offset="3271555">Now, that big mouthful or rather long discussion is what the indictment claims to be the question and which is the basis for the question, which formed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.490" offset="3329337">The petitioner replied, "I decline to answer that question sir on the same grounds as previously set forth in the statement" and as I've indicated, the statement by this time, it included in the record and the statement among other grounds objected to the lack of pertinency of some questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.096" offset="3395793">Mr. Scherer said, "I asked that you direct the witness to answer the question".</text>
            <text syncTime="827.659" offset="3413974">And Mr. Doyle presumably recognizing, that the witness had objected on the ground of pertinency, and recognizing the requirements of the Watkins case, went to answer as follows, "I direct you to answer the question, it is certainly pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.413" offset="3476982">The testimony of Mr. Mignon and others has already shown before this Committee that the union was at that time controlled by the principal officers, by identified communists in control of the policies of the union of which you are now a member and secretary-treasurer in the field of International Cable Communications, which is certainly an area involving the secure -- security of our nation, I direct you to answer the question."</text>
            <text syncTime="871.402" offset="3588995">The petitioner again replied, "Sir, I decline to answer the question on the grounds of lack of Committee jurisdiction under the Watkins decision and on the grounds of the lack of pertinency".</text>
            <text syncTime="882.601" offset="3633821">His last objection went unanswered because the Chairman of the Committee then went on to something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.567" offset="3661615">Now, we submit first, on the basis of this record, that the Government failed to carry its burden of proof to show the pertinency of this question, whatever it may have showed with regard to the inquiry itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.293" offset="3724518">And we proceed on, which I believe is the premises established by the decisions of this Court, that a conviction of contempt may be sustained only if the particular question which forms the basis for the conviction is pertinent to the subject under inquiry, not of some other question which is not in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.327" offset="3800691">And it is not enough to support a conviction to show that there is a general valid subject of inquiry, now, and also under the doctrine of this Court, if the burden is on the Government to prove the pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.551" offset="3865579">Now, the particular question here or though rather obscurely worded input, inquired whether or not the witness Mignon was telling the truth when he testified that he had attended communist cell meetings with the petitioner at some undefined period between 1936 and 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.246" offset="3948335">I don't know when it was but we know it was certainly no later than 1940 because that's when Mignon left the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.979" offset="3975293">Now, the subcommittee's authorizing resolution directed an inquiry into current conditions in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.813" offset="4006640">Furthermore, by the time this question had been put to the witness, the witness had already testified that he had no knowledge or information to give to the Committee concerning these subjects of espionage, sabotage, interception of communications or alleged communist control of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.505" offset="4077380">As a matter of fact, he did give them some testimony to the effect that he didn't see that was possible for anybody to engage in espionage or sabotage and under current conditions but the Committee indicated that they were not interested in that type of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.930" offset="4135058">They were only interested in testimony which said that there would be a danger and they were not interested in any witnesses' testimony that said there was no danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.298" offset="4172570">These were the subjects that fell within the mandate of the subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.844" offset="4190751">And petitioner had been told by the Staff Director earlier during the colloquy that these were the subjects with which the Committee was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.435" offset="4221158">Now, this particular question in count 3 was both remote in time and seemingly off the subject of the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.492" offset="4253341">It certainly has no a priori legitimate connection between this question and the state of subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.339" offset="4288763">Now despite this, the Government wanted to prove pertinency although it doesn't appear from the face of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.371" offset="4316871">If the Government burden to make that showing at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.953" offset="4331186">At the trial, they showed nothing other than the actual transcript of the case, the transcript of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.761" offset="4362428">So, we gained nothing other than what I have already read to Your Honors with regard to the question of pertinency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.957" offset="4391163">Now, the Government here in its brief offers three separate grounds of pertinency for this particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.612" offset="4425853">Before discussing the Government's grounds, I like to note preliminarily that since none of these grounds were communicated to the petitioner at the hearing itself when he objected to pertinency, I do not believe the Government can rely upon them here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.604" offset="4497742">I think that principle was best set forth in the dissenting opinion of Justices Harlan and Frankfurter in Deutch, even though it was a dissenting opinion that spoke I'm sure on this point for the unanimous court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.775" offset="4550510">And I like to quote very briefly from that because it -- it expressed it quite heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.996" offset="4571408">It said, "The Government must stand or fall upon the explanation of pertinency given at the legislative hearing since it would obviously unfair to allow the Government at trial to prove pertinency on a different theory than was given to the defendant at the time he testified and on the basis of which he presumably determined that it need not answer the questions put".</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.162" offset="4672031">I like to also note parenthetically that not only are the three grounds which the Government advances for pertinency here not grounds which will communicate it to the petitioner at the hearing but they were not grounds which apparently occurred to anybody either at the trial or at the court below and have come forth from the Government for the first time in the brief in the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.327" offset="4760639">The Government contends first that the question was pertinent because the Government says it tested the credibility of the witness Mignon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.630" offset="4801912">Now, we submit that if the -- if the question had any purpose, it is certainly was not to test the credibility of the witness Mignon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.063" offset="4835662">Not only was the petitioner not told that that was the purpose but on the contrary, after he refused to answer the question as to whether Mignon was telling the truth or the falsehood, the Chairman of the Committee reasserted his confidence in Mignon's testimony and he said, "Mignon's testimony on the testimony of the others have already established this matter to our satisfaction”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.704" offset="4922180">It's a -- I don't see how anybody could possibly conclude from that that the Committee was interested in testing the credibility of a witness whom they had satisfied themselves was a reliable witness and whom they had classified as a friendly cooperative witness in contrast to the witness -- to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.851" offset="5006817">Further, there is an additional objection here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.479" offset="5017266">Furiously enough although the trial court never bothered to state why he considered the question to be pertinent, he gave no reasons at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.944" offset="5051120">He did make an expressed finding, as acknowledged by the Government here, that the question was not put to the petitioner for the purpose of testing Mignon's credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.830" offset="5098663">Now, the Government argues here that the trial court was mistaken on that point and this Court can disregard the trial court's finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.166" offset="5136071">I suggest the matter is not that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.037" offset="5147564">As this Court has indicated in a number of cases particularly in Sacher, the question of pertinency and particularly the explanation of pertinency must appear to the petitioner or to the witness while he is on the witness stand with what has been described as undisputable clarity in the language of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.531" offset="5221543">We have a situation here where one tribunal says that the question does not have that meaning or significance to suggest that you might reject and overrule that it seems to me at any event, makes it perfectly clear that the question does not indisputably clear, its -- its argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.902" offset="5286954">And we can dispute what it might or might not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.938" offset="5303150">And a matter of fact that was the principle of Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in Sacher in which he pointed out that the question was there, it cannot be set to be indispu -- indisputably -- clearly pertinent to the subject under inquiry when the lower tribunals below had differed as to the meaning and significance of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.411" offset="5384965">Secondly, the Government argues that the question was pertinent because it was preliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.598" offset="5409729">I submit that certainly that suggestion is really unpardonably inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.369" offset="5444838">The question was put to the witness and if we want to look just at pages in the transcript in the record, the interrogation was commenced and the printed record at page 69, this particular question was not put to him until page 97.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.785" offset="5510562">It was put to him almost at the close of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.445" offset="5525191">It was after the staff interrogation had been concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.117" offset="5539819">It was after two members of the three-man subcommittee had announced that they had no further questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.201" offset="5560195">One of them actually thought that the witness had been excused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.257" offset="5576391">Moreover, the witness had already testified that he had no information as to the announced subjects of inquiry and yet the Government suggest that this question was pertinent because it was preliminary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.820" offset="5622680">Preliminary to what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.726" offset="5626232">I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.550" offset="5629576">It has some suggestion here that if he had answered the question, the Committee would doubtless of going on and done several other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.928" offset="5979094">Finally, the Government contends that the question and this is a contention that they made for the first time in its brief here although they did not even have in the opposition to assert that although remote in time, it's pertinent because remote questions are pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.301" offset="6036564">Well, I just suggest that that only begs the question but to say that it's pertinent because they believe it's pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.076" offset="6067702">I want to turn now to my second prime in may argument and that is the failure to give within the language of Watkins a meaningful explanation of the pertinency of the question once there was an objection on the ground of pertinency and to quote very briefly from Watkins as to the burden placed upon the Committee, I think on occasion when there is an objection, to be meaningful, the explanation must describe what the topic under inquiry is and the connective reasoning whereby the precise questions asked relate to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.070" offset="6223600">Now, petitioner's pertinency objection was met first with the statement of Congressman Doyle that the question was certainly pertinent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1541.396" offset="6268949">He followed with what I have read to Your Honors and I have set out again at page 30 of my brief, simply a statement that they were satisfied from the testimony of Mignon and other witnesses that they really had all the information they needed on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.438" offset="6333106">Now, that would only raise the additional problem it seems to me as to -- it's rather right for the subcommittee to decide or press a question when they were already satisfied that they had all the information they needed on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.662" offset="6385977">But in any event, whatever view one might take of Congressman Doyle's remarks, it certainly does not contain any connective reasoning, connecting count 3 to the subject under inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.945" offset="6515127">Now, the court below and I believe the Government here conceives that the balancing test must be met but it says that the balancing test must be met, and I want to take it from a different point of view not so much the rights of the petitioner, but what was the interest of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.913" offset="6579075">And they say the interest of the Government was to preserve the communications industry against disaster.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.522" offset="6897455">Well, let's put it this way, if the Committee is not interested and -- and the Staff Director there has made it perfectly clear, not only under the annual report reflects that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.384" offset="6944893">When they wrote up this case, they resided the testimony of a number of witnesses who said that there was a great danger of espionage and sabotage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.997" offset="6983346">This witness and other witnesses including witnesses from the industry, who said that the nature of the manner in which the messages were sent was such that espionage was almost impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.646" offset="7037994">It was let completely out of the annual report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.013" offset="7051473">And I asked Mr. Arens about that on the witness stand and he said, "Well, we did not include in our conclusions any testimony from witnesses in whom we had no confidence, we did not interpose much confidence”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.192" offset="7108106">Now if they want to disregard his testimonies, they were going to disregard it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.418" offset="7125034">I don't think there's any question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.011" offset="7135378">But this is -- the purpose of this question is not to cross-examine him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.838" offset="7154709">The purpose of this question was perfectly clear to me to harass him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.264" offset="7168397">But I don't know or much more likely if one may give another and there's a good bit of wisdom, in a quotation I have made from Debrow's case and I think one must was recognized that even where there is a valid subject of inquiry before a committee, congressmen have a tendency, very often, to ask questions from either curiosity or from interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.811" offset="7266617">Now not every one of those questions has a great bearing on the subject and most congressional committees I believe that they get into a dispute with the witness or something rather will drop the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.517" offset="7313429">I can't see how any committee can seriously believe, who is seriously interested in the state of subject of inquiry, can seriously believe that an answer to this question would have been of any assistance to it or that the answer to that question is of such importance that the petitioner here is entitled to go -- should be sent to jail for four months for refusing to answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.241" offset="7424293">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.270" offset="7440488">Petitioners in the Grumman and Silber cases were convicted for refusing to answer questions during an investigation of Communist activities in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.050" offset="7479568">That is the cable, telegraph and radio companies which transmit messages both Government and private messages, both within the United States and between the United States and overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.473" offset="7533275">The American Communications Association, a leading union in the communications industry, had been expelled from the C.I.O. in 1950 for following Communist policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.689" offset="7582177">In addition to this information, the Committee had considerable information that principle officers of the Association were members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.802" offset="7622614">The purpose of the investigation was to discover whether these officers were members of the Communist Party and whether the existence of communist in the communications industry endanger national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.281" offset="7684472">If such a danger existed, the Committee indicated that it will -- that it would propose corrective legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.019" offset="7719476">Therefore, throughout the hearing, the Committee repeatedly asked witnesses what legislation could be used to lessen the danger from Communist activity in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.187" offset="7776110">Before petitioner Grumman appeared before the Committee, and of course also before petitioner Silber appeared since he was subsequent to petitioner Grumman, Committee heard five witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.200" offset="7828146">Three of these witnesses were leading officials of large companies in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.654" offset="7853955">The other two witnesses were members of the American -- were former members of the American Communications Association, long time workers in the communications industry and former members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.686" offset="7914141">The latter two witnesses testified that present principle officers of the American Communications Association had at least at the time that the witness -- witnesses had been in the Communist Party, been members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.889" offset="7978924">Petitioner Grumman, like petitioner Yellin, had been publicly identified at a committee hearing as a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.936" offset="8023124">Michael Mignon testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.747" offset="8034408">The petitioner Grumman and he had been members of Local 10 of the American Communications Association and of the Communist Party together and that they had attended close meetings of the Communist Party together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.664" offset="8089997">These five witnesses further testified that Communist in the communications industry posed an extremely serious danger to American security for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.318" offset="8136600">The first reason they said is that Communist could intercept secret Government messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.227" offset="8156244">For these messages were generally in code, they thought that if the messages were copied down and taken away from the -- particular place where they -- the communications place, the code could well be broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.100" offset="8211728">The second way of the Communist posed a great danger was that in a time of crisis, even one or two Communist could easily, in a few minutes, sabotage key components necessary to send important Government messages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.474" offset="8265226">And the third reason, that Communist in the industry post a great danger, was that during an emergency, they could use the communication system to send messages between themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.909" offset="8319039">When petitioner Grumman appeared before the Committee, he told the Committee that he was a long time officer of Local 10 of the American Communications Association, secretary-treasurer to be exact and a long time worker in the industry, 25 years in R.C.A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.530" offset="8389465">He refused to answer numerous questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.806" offset="8402631">However, his conviction was based solely on his refusal to answer a single question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.746" offset="8426350">After petitioner had refused to answer questions concerning current Communist activity including whether he was currently a member of the Communist Party and who has knowledge about current Communist activity in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.399" offset="8484968">The Committee went back to advance on which it had definite information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.604" offset="8501791">In essence, it went back to the beginning with the information which indicated to with the petitioner Grumman did have information concerning the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.224" offset="8544319">The Committee therefore asked petitioner whether Michael Mignon was telling the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.055" offset="8567620">When he testified, the petitioner had been a member along with the witness of the Communist Party and Local 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.596" offset="8597713">And the petitioner had been in closed communist cell meetings with the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.828" offset="8622686">This question we submit was in effect whether petitioner had been a member of the Communist Party at that time, which was between 1936 and 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.117" offset="8671796">Now, before I turn to the First Amendment arguments and to the arguments centering on pertinency, I would like to consider this briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.819" offset="8718608">The question was -- which Mr. Rein suggested, whether the indictment was insufficient because it did not state the subject under inquiry in specific terms and did not state the relationship of the particular questions to the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.228" offset="8776286">And in addition, a subject, an argument which he did -- did not mention whether the indictment was insufficient because it alleged that the refusal to answer was unlawful but did not state that it was willful.</text>

            <text syncTime="2208.193" offset="8936155">But the -- the content of our answer is the same, that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.339" offset="8960711">All these questions, all three of them broken down into pieces are in the six cases that were in the -- that were submitted to this Court in the fall involving contempt of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.260" offset="9012433">Now, the indictment which petitioner attacks is identical in form with that which has been repeatedly before this Court, in Watkins, in Barenblatt, in Wilkinson, in Deutch and almost every one of the other cases which has been here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.340" offset="9064782">Yellin is an exception, Braden is an exception insofar as willfulness is specific but I believe that the subject under inquiry is not specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.058" offset="9107623">And both the petitioner's contentions have been repeatedly rejected by the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.569" offset="9129671">In fact, there is no decision that we know of which supports petitioner's contention, any one of the three contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.301" offset="9164570">Now, turning more specifically to petitioner's contention that the indictment should have specified the particular subject under inquiry in the particular pertinency of the questions to this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.812" offset="9210650">Rule 7 (c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure states that the indictment, and I'm quoting, "shall be a plain concise and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged".</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.600" offset="9269791">The federal courts, including this Court, have repeatedly held that the Rule 7 requires no more than the indictment and charge the essential elements of the offense in terms -- in the terms of the statute so that the defendant can adequate -- adequately prepare his defense and prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.537" offset="9361533">And I may say that Rule 7 and the decisions of this Court under it and the decisions to that matter of the court -- Courts of Appeals have indicated that -- that there are -- that increasingly, the idea of indictments is to be a simple and as brief as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.612" offset="9429870">If -- the whole trend of the cases has been in this direction, petitioner's quite technical argument, it seems to us to ask -- to go back at least in part to the old rules of technical and complicated and very full indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.058" offset="9503640">In the Markham case even as long ago as 160 United States, however, this Court stated that an allegation, that a false statement was material to an inquiry then pending, and I'm quoting "was material to an inquiry then pending".</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.718" offset="9574275">An allegation which is virtually identical to that made and the indictment here was sufficient to charge perjury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2405.829" offset="9726725">However, there's full paragraph -- in fact, I think at the point that you mention at the footnote, we said our -- most to their paragraph, although not all, in which the Court with -- with obvious approval set forth numerous statements by authorities saying that all that had to be stated in the indictment was that that the inquiry was material without specifying the particular subject to the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.471" offset="9829230">And this Court stated in the Sinclair case that the pertinency of questions to the subject under inquiry, in a contempt case is not essentially different from the question as to the materiality of false testimony charged this perjury in prosecutions for that crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.438" offset="9993174">First, in order to give the defendants sufficient information to defend himself and second, to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3164.082" offset="12759751">They have to have a reasonable ground to think that the person has information of value to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.470" offset="12777200">I don't think they have to have probable cause that he's a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.223" offset="12792247">For example, if they have -- if they had reason to believe that he associated with Communist or he was an officer in a -- in a group that was heavily -- that was -- that -- that was heavily unfiltered -- infiltrated by Communist so that he would likely know about his fellow officers or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.030" offset="12863509">I may say that this issue is not in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3251.069" offset="13107597">I think I -- well, Your Honor, I think that is the basic principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.340" offset="13124733">Now, the way I read Barenblatt, Braden and Wilkinson is that to some very limited extent, the prin -- the principle is limited by the important First Amendment Rights which are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.530" offset="13173530">But I think if -- I think you're -- you're absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.447" offset="13181158">The basic principle is that a committee can call anybody it wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.193" offset="13200175">Now, if First Amendment Rights weren't involved here at all, it didn't have any basis, any First Amendment Rights whatsoever, I think they can call anybody right off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.825" offset="13234657">Now, because the First Amendment Rights are involved, I read those three cases to indicate that part of the balance is whether they've indiscriminately called the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.139" offset="13283976">But I think that's a very limited exception to the general principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.809" offset="13302575">And I think that's -- and that's -- but I think that's quite clear from the three opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.787" offset="13350536">Because of the limited time I have left, I -- I would -- I think I would rather turn to the pertinency contentions made by petitioner Grumman since they are essentially the only contentions which he makes which are different from those made in the Yellin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.630" offset="13425873">Now, it's perfectly clear the subject that the question on which petitioner was convicted was in law pertinent to the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.740" offset="13470281">The resolution of the Committee authorizing the hearings, the statement of the Chairman of the subcommittee at the start of the hearings and repeated statements during the hearings said that the subject under inquiry was Communist activity in the communications industry and the question which petitioner refused to answer on its phase considering the fact that petitioner admitted that he was a long time worker in the industry and a member of the American Communications Association was on its phase pertinent to the subject under inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.402" offset="13597027">Now, petitioner Grumman's main contention seems to be that there's an exception to this obviously close connection because the question concerned events between 1936 and 1940 and it was therefore remote in time to the subject under inquiry which was current Communist activities in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.281" offset="13692531">Now, the Government submits that there are three ways that the question which petitioner refused to answer was pertinent in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.631" offset="13729938">First, we submitted -- tested the credibility of our previous witness, Michael Mignon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.920" offset="13755016">But though the trial court did not think that this was the purpose of the question, we submit that this is not a determination of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.042" offset="13787512">And on its phase, the question tested the credibility of Michael Mignon before it explicitly asked petitioner whether Mignon was telling the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.228" offset="13828263">And the second way that the question -- the information sought whether question would be useful was that if petitioner was a member of the Communist Party in 1940, he could provide information about Communist Party activities at that time and such information would be important, we submit, in understanding the present and future activities of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.332" offset="13928678">It is particularly necessary in investigating the Communist Party just largely conspiratorial in secret and in the early 1950's, went almost entirely underground, perhaps more than any other subject to question witnesses about earlier Communist Party activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.724" offset="14002239">And therefore, this Court in the Communist Party case specifically held that evidence of Communist Party activities 20 or even 30 years ago was pertinent to the Party's current activities and character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.598" offset="14061798">And the third way that this question sought information which was pertinent was that the question on which petitioner was convicted was a preliminary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.789" offset="14102549">I may say that in Wilkinson, this Court upheld under both -- a tax, both on the grounds of pertinency and the First Amendment, an inquiry which it said was a preliminary question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.979" offset="14151241">Committee told petitioner that the purpose of questions as to its membership in the Communist Party was to provide a basis on which to question petitioner concerning current Party activities in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.037" offset="14211532">Now, turning to the second half of the -- of the pertinency issue whether petitioner was apprised of the subject under inquiry and the pertinency of the questions, petitioner claims that there were -- that the three reasons which I have just given, why the question was not too remote, was not conveyed to him by the Committee at that time that he refused to answer and that therefore, he was not apprised of the pertinency of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.638" offset="14317902">He's -- it is important to remember at the start that a congressional committee need only state the connective reasoning between the question and the subject under in quarrel -- inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.668" offset="14361997">Surely, the statement need not have the subtlety or the fullness of a brief or argument in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.755" offset="14390418">The fact that the Government has spelled out in greater detail the pertinency of the question, it does not seem to us that the Committee wasn't -- was required to give the page on page of our argument to the witness in that kind of detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.524" offset="14457501">Petitioner could not have failed to understand the pertinency of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.243" offset="14472338">The Committee repeatedly told him the subject under inquiry was Communist activities in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.518" offset="14501491">The question as to whether petitioner was a member of the Communist Party with Michael Mignon was on its phase clearly pertinent to this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.294" offset="14532524">And this Court so held in the Barrenblatt and in the Wilkinson cases that a question as the Communist Party membership was on its phase pertinent to an investigation of Communist activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.219" offset="14580276">And in addition, the Committee told petitioner that the questions as to his membership in the Communist Party were pertinent because they were intended to ascertain whether petitioner could provide information concerning Communist activities in the communications industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.169" offset="14648090">The Committee did not specifically state why the question was not too remote since petitioner never suggested that the question concerned events which were too remote.</text>
