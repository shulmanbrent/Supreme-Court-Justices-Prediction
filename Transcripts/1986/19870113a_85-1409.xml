            <text>We will hear arguments next in No. 85-1409, Otis R. Bowen, Secretary of Health and Human Services, versus Janet F. Yuckert.</text>
            <text>Mr. Kneedler, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the question of the validity of the severity regulation that was promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under the disability programs established by Titles 2 and 16 of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text>The current version of the severity regulation is an integral part of the five-step sequential evaluation process that the Secretary established by regulation in 1978 to promote the fair, uniform, and efficient evaluation of the more than two million claims that are filed annually under the program.</text>
            <text>Within the framework of this sequential evaluation process the severity regulation serves two distinct but largely overlapping purposes.</text>
            <text>First, it assures that benefits are paid only to persons for whom a significant medical impairment as distinguished from an adverse vocational profile consisting of age, education, and work experience is the primary or substantial cause of his inability to work.</text>
            <text>It is this requirement that distinguishes the disability program from other forms of unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text>The second principle or purpose served by the severity regulation is that it screens out at an early stage of the sequential evaluation process those claimants who it may reasonably be presumed would be found not to be disabled even if the Secretary proceeded throughout that process and conducted a fullblown vocational assessment.</text>
            <text>Four terms ago, in Heckler versus Campbell, this Court unanimously sustained the medical vocational guidelines that are applied at Step 5 of the sequential evaluation process.</text>
            <text>The Court recognized the compelling need for efficiency and uniformity of adjudication in the massive disability programs sustaining those regulations.</text>
            <text>Those same considerations underlie the severity regulation as well.</text>
            <text>In this case, however, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the severity regulation conflicts with the Social Security Act and is invalid on its face.</text>
            <text>It is the government's position before this Court that that holding is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text>The principle on which the severity regulation is based which is that benefits may be denied in appropriate cases on the basis of medical evidence alone that shows an impairment is relatively minor, that principle has been a feature of the disability programs since they were started in 1954, and since that time, and particularly most recently since 1978 literally millions of claims have been screened against that test.</text>
            <text>The current version of the regulation, as we show in our briefs, is supported by the text and legislative history of the 1954 and '67 amendments to the Act, but beyond that it is our submission that Congress in the text and legislative history of the disability amendments of 1984 ratified the amendment.</text>
            <text>Now, before discussing those arguments in any detail I will briefly--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Ratified the regulations?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--Yes, I am sorry, ratified the regulation.</text>
            <text>I will briefly outline the statutory scheme and the sequential evaluation process to explain where the severity regulation fits in.</text>
            <text>The basic definition of disability for the programs was enacted in 1954.</text>
            <text>It provides that the term disability shall mean the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, and then with a certain durational requirement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>That necessarily refers to some medical basis?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>
            <text>And as we point out in our brief the House and Senate reports on the 1954 legislation explain two aspects of disability determination under that standard.</text>
            <text>The first aspect is that there must be an impairment of serious proportions.</text>
            <text>And then the second, picking up on the by reason of language says that the person must be unable to work by reason of such an impairment, in other words, one that is already--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Whatever impairment it is has to be because of some medically determinable--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--That's right.</text>
            <text>In 1967 Congress enacted Section 423(d)(2)(A) to further restrict eligibility in light of some judicial decisions, and under that provision the requirement is that the claimant be unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity that exists anywhere in the national economy irrespective of whether those jobs are in his own vicinity or whether he would be hired for them.</text>
            <text>The sequential evaluation process established by regulation in 1978 implements these statutory standards.</text>
            <text>It doesn't incorporate new concepts.</text>
            <text>These are all concepts in the adjudication process that had been in existence long before 1978.</text>
            <text>The first step in the process is really irrelevant here.</text>
            <text>It is that if a person is already engaging in substantial gainful activity, obviously he is not disabled because he can work.</text>
            <text>Steps 2 and 3 then establish what are really two outer limits or two points on a spectrum in which the least serious and the most serious impairments can be identified on medical grounds alone.</text>
            <text>At Step 2 that addresses the least serious impairments and under that test the claimant must satisfy a certain minimum threshold of impairment severity to justify the Secretary's considering it as probably being the primary cause of his inability to work.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--Mr. Kneedler, was the respondent's claim rejected at Step 2?</text>
            <text>It didn't survive Step 2?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>It did not survive Step 2.</text>
            <text>That's correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>And was the respondent's claim evaluated under the Secretary's guidelines, 8528, which talk now in terms of some minimal impairment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>That interpretive ruling was not in effect at the time that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So presumably this respondent's claim was not evaluated at Step 2 with that guideline in mind.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--But that guideline as the Secretary made clear in promulgating it, does not state a new policy.</text>
            <text>It reflects what the proper standard of adjudication should have been and was under the program prior to that time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, it certainly might have been helpful to the administrator considering the claim to have had that in mind, at least if you read about this particular respondent's problems, it would appear anyway that they might well have survived Step 2 under that guideline.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>No, I think it is important to bear in mind here, not to focus on respondent's allegations and testimony but the ALJ specifically found that she was exaggerating those claims.</text>
            <text>He found no objective clinical evidence to suggest the severity of those symptoms to that extent, so that I think that there is... it would certainly be our position that even in light of the ruling, which we think didn't change things, that her case would have come out the same.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, wouldn't it perhaps be appropriate even if you are correct to remand Ms. Yuckert's claim at least, leave it open in light of the new guidelines?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>I think not, because applying... first of all, we would have a concern there about courts sending cases back in light of the new ruling because it suggests the potential for reopening a lot of past claims, even those that are not currently surviving, and in our view because the ruling did not change the substantive standard of disability, there is no occasion to send it back.</text>
            <text>Now, if--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, the judgment was that this rule was just invalid.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--Invalid on its... and not the ruling, not the interpretive ruling.</text>
            <text>The regulation was invalid on its face.</text>
            <text>Now, we do suggest that--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>But for any purpose, it is just invalid on its face.</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--That's right, invalid on its face.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>That is the issue, isn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>That is the only issue in this case.</text>
            <text>We do--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Where is that interpretive ruling in your brief?</text>
            <text>I am having trouble finding it.</text>
            <text>Do you have it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--It is in the Appendix to our certiorari petition at Pages... beginning on Page 37A.</text>
            <text>On Page 41A the Secretary explains that the standard is that a claim will be not severe if it would have no more than a minimal effect on an individual's ability to work even if his age, education, and work experience were specifically considered, that is, that the person's impairment would have no more than a minimal effect on his physical or mental abilities to perform basic work activities.</text>
            <text>If we look at the preamble to the notice of proposed rulemaking in 1978, that is exactly the description of the severity regulation itself, not the ruling but the regulation itself that the Secretary gave, so this does not establish new ground.</text>
            <text>It clarifies what--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>That same language is in the preamble?</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--Quite close to it.</text>
            <text>It is on the portion of the preamble to the 1987... yes, it is on Page 9296 of the Federal Register from 1978.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>How does that language go?</text>
            <text>Frankly, the fact that the Secretary said in issuing this interpretive ruling that he was making no change does not mean that he was making no change.</text>
            <text>It seems to me that is not something he can make happen by just saying it has happened.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Well, in terms of what the department's official position and what the regulation meant, now, if there were individual applications of the regulation during the interval in which ALJs had misapplied it, that is a different question, but we are talking about what the substantive legal--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>No, if in fact he meant something earlier and he now says, no, what I meant all along was something different, he can't change what the past was.</text>

          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--Well, in the preamble in 1978 the Secretary explained it, that there is a point in the range of impairment severity below which the effects of the impairment have such a minimal effect on the individual that they would not be expected to interfere with his or her ability to work irrespective of his age, education, or work experience.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Mr. Kneedler, the hard thing about this case is really understanding what the threshold is.</text>
            <text>Is it your view that there could be a medical impairment, the dizziness and so forth, all the stuff that this particular claimant asserted that could prevent her from doing the job she used to do in the past but nevertheless could be as a matter of law nonsevere within the meaning of the severity--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Yes, that is our position, and that is spelled out in the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--Even though it is clear that it impairs her from doing a particular job, but that is not necessarily--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--Yes.</text>
            <text>Now, the most recent ruling does identify an accommodation of the past work principle.</text>
            <text>First, let me state the general rule.</text>
            <text>The premise is that the definition of a nonsevere impairment is one that does not significantly limit the ability to do basic work activities that are necessary for most jobs, so the assumption is, if the claimant has an impairment that falls into that category she is able to do most jobs, and therefore would be able to do her own past work.</text>
            <text>The new ruling says that if the claimant is unable to do his or her past work by virtue of unique features of that work, then it is not something... it is not something that is addressed by the most jobs limitation.</text>
            <text>It is one of those few jobs that is unique, that has unique job requirements, and the new ruling allows the sequential evaluation process to progress beyond that point.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>--Well, let me just interrupt you if I may.</text>
            <text>We have a case here, she was a travel agent, I think, in this case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Yes, and--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Surely that is not a unique job.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>So that if there were a medical impairment severe enough to prevent her from doing that work, could that end the inquiry?</text>
            <text>I mean, it is severe enough to prevent her from doing that work, but then they think, well, it may... would that automatically require her to pass Step 2, enable her to pass Step 2?</text>

            <text>I am puzzled, then.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>--The uniqueness of the job does if it has unique job requirements.</text>
            <text>The example that is sometimes mentioned is the pilot who must have 20-20 vision.</text>
            <text>If he has 20-30 vision it is a unique requirement of his job.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Yes.</text>
            <text>Yes, because the premise of the regulation is that the claimant has the ability to do basic work functions necessary for most jobs to stand, to... or that that is not significantly affected.</text>

            <text>Congress in this context acted against the background of the severity regulation that specifically said your age, education, and work experience will not be considered and against the background of the regulations that said if you are weeded out at any step the process will not proceed, which includes the consequence that if you are weeded out at the severity step you don't get to the point of considering the person's ability to do past work.</text>

            <text>Mr. Kneedler, is it true that 12 different Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that that goes beyond the Secretary's statutory authority?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Well, five courts have sustained the regulation.</text>
            <text>They have sustained it on the ground that it did not accomplish a change from what the Secretary... the standard the Secretary was applying prior to 1978.</text>
            <text>That has always been the Secretary's position.</text>
            <text>That is explained in the preamble to the severity... to the vocational regulations in 1978, so that is not... that is not really an issue here, but whether or not there is a change is really irrelevant at this point, because whatever the prior law might have been, Congress ratified the current severity regulations when it enacted the 1984 Act.</text>
            <text>And this is clear from looking at the text of the provision that was added in 1984, which is on Page 27 of our brief.</text>
            <text>The first sentence of that says... first of all, the purpose of the 1984 amendments was to require the Secretary to consider the combined effect of multiple impairments, but Congress otherwise left the sequential evaluation process untouched, and that appears... the significance of that appears in the very language Congress used in the Act.</text>
            <text>It says,</text>
            <text>"in determining whether an individual's physical or mental impairments are of sufficient medical severity that they could be the basis of a finding of eligibility, the Secretary will consider the combined effect."</text>
            <text>Well, that first sentence clearly says medical severity, and it states it in terms of whether it could be a basis of eligibility, which is language of a threshold test.</text>
            <text>Then the second sentence says, if the Secretary does find a medically severe combination of impairments, he will consider that combination throughout the disability determination process, in other words, throughout the subsequent steps of the sequential evaluation process.</text>
            <text>The obvious intent of this is that those subsequent steps will be reached only if, in the words of the statute, the Secretary first does find a medically severe impairment, so the endorsement of the Secretary's approach in the regulations, which were clear on their face, is right in the language of the Act, but if there could be any doubt about that it is dispelled by a reference to the legislative history of the Act.</text>
            <text>First, we... as this Court recognized in Heckler versus Day several terms ago, Congress was very aware of the way the disability program was being run in the late seventies and early 1980s.</text>
            <text>We have listed in Footnote 11 of our reply brief a whole series of Congressional references to the way the severity step of the sequential evaluation process worked.</text>
            <text>That shows Congress was fully aware of the various features that are being discussed here and that have been discussed by respondents, including the fact that the number of denials on the basis of nonsevere impairment went from 8 percent in 1975 to 40 percent in 1981.</text>
            <text>Congress knew all of that, so Congress ratified this regulation against the background of a thorough knowledge of the way in which it operated.</text>
            <text>Several of those as well as the committee prints cited in the amicus brief of the AARP, there is a House committee print that specifically refers to the fact that the burden of proof with respect to prior work does not occur until Step 5.</text>
            <text>Congress understood how it worked, but the Committee reports on the 1984 legislation make that even clearer.</text>
            <text>The Senate brief, for example, stresses that this new rule of considering combined impairments is to be applied in strict conformity with the current sequential evaluation process.</text>
            <text>The House report discusses the sequential evaluation process and says that the ability to do past work and other work will be considered only after a finding of severity.</text>
            <text>The conference report paraphrases the existing regulation in terms of whether there is a significant effect on the ability to do basic work activities, and it says we do not intend to impair the use of that sequential evaluation process.</text>
            <text>Finally, Senator Long, who had an extended history in the development of the disability program, explained what Congress had done in the conference report.</text>
            <text>He said that some courts had ruled the Secretary can't rule out claimants on the basis of medical grounds alone, and there were District Court decisions like that at that time, Dixon and others.</text>
            <text>But Senator Long said the Senate bill after which the conference bill was patterned was drafted in a way to make sure the Secretary can do that.</text>

            <text>Mr. Kneedler, can I ask one other question?</text>
            <text>As I understand it, there are three kinds of impairments, ones that are nonsevere, those that are severe enough to go past Step 2, and then you have an exhibit at the end of the regulations that say some of them are so severe that you win right away.</text>

            <text>It is also important to bear in mind that if the decisionmaker reflexively applies the vocational guidelines then you might find people disabled because the vocational guidelines are expressly premised on the existence of a severe impairment.</text>

            <text>If someone is found disabled at Step 5 of the sequential evaluation process by considering his age, education, and work experience, the regulations are drafted in a way that you are only supposed to get there if the claimant has first been found to have a severe impairment.</text>
            <text>If the decisionmaker applies those regulations without having made that threshold determination, you will get improper decisions at Step 5 because they are not predicated on the existence of a severe impairment.</text>

            <text>Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Congress created the disability insurance program with a specific goal in mind.</text>
            <text>That was to provide benefits to fully insured workers whose medically determinable impairments prevented them from working.</text>
            <text>The Secretary has designed through the severity regulation a mechanism which prevents many disabled workers from establishing their eligibility for benefits.</text>
            <text>The Court of Appeals as well as ten other Courts of Appeals have found the Secretary's construction and use of the severity regulation is illegal in that it denies claimants the opportunity to prove that their medically determinable impairments in fact prevent them from working.</text>

            <text>Ms. Grossman, may I inquire whether you think that the guidelines adopted in SSR 8528 adequately explain what should happen at Step 2?</text>

          <turn speaker="carole_f_grossman">
            <label>Ms. Carole F. Grossman</label>
            <text>Justice O'Connor, the Social Security ruling 8528 is ambiguous.</text>
            <text>Its content is ambiguous.</text>
            <text>It is very difficult to tell whether or not any change has occurred from the severity regulation.</text>
            <text>I think that the Secretary has recently argued that it does not constitute a change.</text>
            <text>Although there are some procedural protections offered that are clearly not in the regulation itself, such as a great care standard, the standard itself remains a substitution of basic work activities for the ability to do prior work.</text>
            <text>In that sense the standard itself has not changed.</text>
            <text>I thin it is important to note that--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>It does, though, clarify the fact that it is only a... something that has more than a minimal effect on a person's ability to do basic work activities, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carole_f_grossman">
            <label>Ms. Carole F. Grossman</label>
            <text>--It does use the language of a de minimis threshold.</text>
            <text>I agree.</text>
            <text>What concerns respondent is that most recently the Secretary argues both in reply and before this Court that it does not matter whether a de minimis standard is articulated, although the Secretary insists that there is a de minimis standard in the new ruling, in the interpretive ruling, in their reply they argue that it makes no difference whether there is a de minimis standard because the entire regulation has been ratified.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Well, but as we read it here, when it says that a claim may be denied at Step 2 only if the evidence shows the individual's impairments are not medically severe.</text>
            <text>Do you quarrel with that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carole_f_grossman">
            <label>Ms. Carole F. Grossman</label>
            <text>No, we have no quarrel with that.</text>
            <text>I think the greatest problem in this case is figuring out what terms mean, and the only way you can figure out what terms mean is to see how the regulation is construed and applied by the Secretary.</text>
            <text>Every Court of Appeals that has considered the issue has found that the Secretary's construction and use of the severity regulation violates the Social Security Act because it does deny claimants who are potentially disabled under the definition of the Act.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text>Those decisions didn't have in mind the guideline in 8528, did they?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carole_f_grossman">
            <label>Ms. Carole F. Grossman</label>
            <text>Well, two Courts of Appeals have now considered 8528.</text>
            <text>The Tenth Circuit has rejected it as not representing any change, and therefore the conflict between the regulation and the ruling being... still existing.</text>
            <text>The First Circuit has read 8528 as an indication that the Secretary has changed his policy and says that if there hadn't been that change there would be a serious question in the circuit's mind whether or not more judicial interference were necessary, but the First Circuit, it is important to note, reads 8528 consistent with a de minimis standard insofar as it says that if a claimant cannot do their prior work, then it does not matter the particular level of severity, that claimant is entitled to an evaluation under the Act.</text>
            <text>The Secretary in his reply brief has repudiated that reading of 8528 so we are left with only one Circuit Court embracing 8528 as a change, and the Secretary now saying you may not read this as the de minimis standard which you are reading it as.</text>
            <text>If you do we disagree.</text>
            <text>I think the Secretary has made clear today that there is disagreement.</text>

            <text>I think it is clear that there is a substitute of basic work activities for an inquiry into the ability to perform prior work.</text>
            <text>That overbroad irrebuttable presumption which the Secretary in other rulings agrees produces fallacious and insupportable findings in terms of whether or not somebody can actually work, that is clear on the face of the regulation.</text>

            <text>Ms. Grossman, one of the points in the government's case that I found quite persuasive was their reference to the '84 amendment to the Benefits Reform Act, and I don't recall that your brief responded to that.</text>

            <label>Ms. Carole F. Grossman</label>
            <text>The '84... there is a lot of controversy about whether the House or the Senate report should be looked to to understand what happened in the legislative history.</text>
            <text>It is respondent's position that the conferees' report is the most authoritative guide to what was at least agreed to in Congress.</text>
            <text>The conferees' report very carefully defines a de minimis standard.</text>
            <text>It says an individual... that a determination may be made that an individual is not disabled based on a judgment that an individual has no impairment or that the medical severity of his impairment or combination of impairments is slight enough, slight enough to warrant a presumption even without a full evaluation of vocational factors that the individual's ability to perform SGA is not seriously affected.</text>
            <text>That is a standard which was in effect prior to the promulgation of the severity regulation in 1978.</text>
            <text>That is what is called a slightness standard.</text>
            <text>For the conferees to say that they did not mean to impair the use of such a presumption is... indicates that there is no ratification of the current severity policy.</text>

            <text>The House expressed a great deal of concern that this reevaluation be done expeditiously.</text>
            <text>The Secretary had assured Congress that they were reevaluating the nonsevere impairment criteria, so that this statement of the conferees stands as a guide to the Secretary to what they would find to be an acceptable de minimis threshold inquiry with the... notice that they say even without a full evaluation of vocational factors.</text>
            <text>There is no indication whatsoever that they intended to substitute a test of medical severity of a very high threshold for the analysis that is called for in the statute.</text>

            <label>Ms. Carole F. Grossman</label>
            <text>May I say that every Court of Appeals to consider the issue has found that the Secretary's test does not meet that standard.</text>
            <text>The Courts of Appeals which have not invalidated the regulation but which have imposed a narrowing construction on the regulation and said to the Secretary, unless you reference your decisions on the nonsevere regulation to this Court's opinion telling you how the regulation must be interpreted in order to be consistent with the Act, then we will simply remand those decisions because we cannot tolerate your interpretation of the Act through the implementation of this regulation.</text>
            <text>Now, we would argue that invalidation of the regulation is a less intrusive means of correcting the Secretary's interpretation.</text>
            <text>It leaves the Secretary free to develop his own de minimis standard or to skip Step 2 as in 1978 he said he had some questions about whether or not the severity regulation produced all the efficiency measures and uniformity that they had expected it would, and that it might be just as easy to use the previous methods, which were consistent, I would argue, consistent with the act of determining whether or not the person could do their prior work, and then on to the vocational factors once they made that prima facie showing.</text>
            <text>The severity regulation has been preliminarily or permanently judicially enjoined in more than 20 states, yet many disabled workers continue to have their claims summarily and illegally denied on the basis of the regulation.</text>
            <text>Until the conflict between the severity regulation and the Social Security Act is resolved by regulatory revision pursuant to the APA, there will be no resolution.</text>
            <text>Interpretive rulings may be issued and they may be rescinded.</text>
            <text>Although 8255 has been rescinded they are not repudiating what is in the ruling.</text>
            <text>8528 exists today.</text>
            <text>It may not exist when a claim is remanded.</text>
            <text>It provides no clear standard.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text>Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text>There are several points I would like to make.</text>
            <text>With respect to the conference report I would like to point out on Page 47 of our brief we set out the pertinent paragraph of the conference report.</text>
            <text>Respondent does not quote the relevant sentence of ratification here.</text>
            <text>The sentence she quotes says that</text>
            <text>"A judgment that a person is not under a disability may be based on a determination that the impairment is slight enough to warrant a presumption."</text>
            <text>--note it is presumption, not individualized determination...</text>
            <text>"presumption that the impairment is not... that the person's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity is not seriously affected."</text>
            <text>The next sentence says,</text>
            <text>"The current sequential evaluation process allows such a determination, and the conferees do not intend to either eliminate or impair the use of that process."</text>
            <text>"As I have explained, it is entirely clear on the face of the regulations establishing the process that the inability to do past work does not get you past the severity step, and the severity step says that age, education, and work experience are not considered."</text>
