            <text syncTime="25.164" offset="204048">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.517" offset="221393">I represent State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, the original plaintiff in the case, which was filed under Section 1335 of the code as a bill in the nature of interpleader.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.736" offset="286281">Just by way of brief background I think the complaint, which is a part of the record reveals most of these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.968" offset="315225">That Mr. Glasgow, one of the named defendants in the original complaint was the owner of a certain pickup automobile, which he used in his own business to travel to the San Francisco, California area from Medford, Oregon for the purpose of picking up furniture at auction sales and then returning to the Medford area, his home for the purpose of disposing of such merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.897" offset="414908">Mr. Glasgow was not insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.058" offset="423581">He had no insurance, no liability insurance coverage on his vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.169" offset="444061">Mr. Clark one of the other main defendants who is the insured of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, as a friend of Mr. Glasgow was invited to go along on the particular trip to San Francisco, Mr. Clark at that time being unemployed and proceeded to travel with Mr. Glasgow.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.368" offset="536848">At a point some distance north of Redding, Mr. Glasgow, the owner of the vehicle asked Mr. Clark, the State Farm insured whether or not he wouldn't drive the vehicle for a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.339" offset="584704">Mr. Clark honoring such request commenced to drive the vehicle and shortly after he undertook this responsibility, there was a collision which occurred between the Glasgow vehicle been driven by Mr. Clark and a Pacific Greyhound bus, such accident having occurred from all of the investigation on what would be the Greyhound side of the road and not the Clark side of the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.395" offset="704972">Glasgow has no insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.976" offset="711241">Mr. Clark is insured with State Farm Fire and Casualty Company with a total coverage applicable to this situation of $20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.392" offset="748962">Shortly after that the lawsuits are beginning to be filed and after the first five have been filed, the total tort relief exceeds a million dollars, a million one hundred and ten thousand dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.260" offset="804446">There were some 37 claimants, 35 passengers in the bus, and the bus actually traveled over an embankment and as a result the injuries were rather severe in some instances and I think three deaths as a result of the particular collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.069" offset="875604">So State Farm --</text>

            <text syncTime="241.526" offset="1069432">So the parties, all parties except Clark were named as defendants because they are claimants to the Farm, which of course State Farm Fire and Casualty has, by virtue of the policy, which it had issued.</text>

            <label>Mr. Otto R. Skopil, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="298.913" offset="1298996">Yes, our tender in the court is based upon on the condition that there's coverage extended to Mr. Clark and the reason for that question and the reason that the action is brought in the nature of the bill and interpleader is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.021" offset="1355421">As I've indicated, Mr. Glasgow was the owner of the vehicle, which was been driven by Mr. Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.927" offset="1379035">The vehicle was being operated in another person's business namely Mr. Glasgow's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.622" offset="1401814">So one of the exclusion of all of our policies, if you're operating a non-owned automobile in the business of another it comes within exclusion under your policy, you know, just as, if I were driving laundry truck for a certain laundry company.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.008" offset="1459388">My coverage will not apply while I was operating a non-owned vehicle in somebody else's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.615" offset="1481853">So that's the basis for the coverage question and that's the reason of course that Mr. Clark is named in the situation because we do have a contractual question between Mr. Clark and State Farm Fire and Casualty under the coverage question.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.230" offset="1540263">Now, the two questions which I've really been raised and the ones, which State Farm is concerned there have been some side issues raised as the result of Greyhound having been named as a party defendant, which I feel have no bearing on the questions which are actually before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.612" offset="1601808">The first issue of course is the jurisdiction of the subject matter itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.813" offset="1618631">I think the reading of the opinion of the Ninth Circuit will reveal that they indicated that the action and nature of interpleader must be dismissed for lack for jurisdiction over the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.330" offset="1664711">So that is the first question which has been raised and was not a question actually upon which this matter was appealed in the Ninth Circuit but was the ruling of the Ninth Circuit after a consideration of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.683" offset="1714134">The second issue and I'll deal with them separately consist of whether or not there is jurisdiction over the Canadian residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.295" offset="1748511">11 of the passengers in the Greyhound bus were Canadian residents, so that question has been raised and was the question that actually this matter went down to the Ninth Circuit on.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.024" offset="1795427">First, with reference to the jurisdiction of the subject matter as I've indicated, we rely on the provisions of Section 1335 of the code which actually really requires three jurisdictional facts as I read that particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.849" offset="1870764">First of all, it requires a person, firm or a corporation who has in his custody money or property of the value of $500 or more or having issued a policy of insurance in the value of an amount of $500 or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.087" offset="1931682">In this situation as I've indicated, there's an insurance policy issued in the amount of $20,000 coverage for this particular incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.216" offset="1972224">Secondly, the diversity of citizenship for the claimants as defined in the statute of 1335 and you'll note that a reading of that statute actually defines the diversity of citizenship as being that referred to in Section 1332 and of course we have that situation in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.997" offset="2067310">There were 11 Canadian subjects, there were 10 Washington residents, there were 9 Oregon residents, there were 7 California residents and I think 1 Montana resident and a south or north Dakota resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.120" offset="2119868">So actually we come within the third subdivision of Section 1332 and that is subdivision three of subsection A, and that is citizens of different states and in which foreign states or citizens or subjects thereof are additional parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.634" offset="2185906">So we have the diversity of citizenship in that each of the claimants or I should say that the claimants are diverse in citizenship and as indicated, we have Canadians, we have -- people from the State of Washington, people from the State of Oregon, California and two other States Montana and South Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.717" offset="2258213">So the diversity of citizenship is obviously present which is required under the provisions of 1335 as defined in 1332.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.185" offset="2304084">The third requirement of course --</text>

            <text syncTime="609.837" offset="2542738">Perhaps I think 1397 just answers the question which has been asked by Your Honor because it says in any civil action of interpleader or in the nature of interpleader under Section 1335 of this Title maybe brought in the judicial district in which one or more of the claimants reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.536" offset="2617553">Now, the venue situation perhaps I think I'm sure that there has been some mention made in the amicus curiae brief of this fact that is that we're trying to go for money, which of course as far as State Farm is concerned we're only interested in getting our $20,000 in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.783" offset="2690487">If we owe the money that the property or the bundle may distributed inequitable distribution to each of the claimants that the multiplicity of suits will be eliminated and that of course double vexation will be eliminated.</text>

            <text syncTime="776.859" offset="3210846">I think there's double vexation in this particular case because of course if Greyhound were sued particularly in the State of California and a judgment was obtained against Greyhound, they certainly would have a right of contribution back against the fund of the insurance company as a result of having insured Mr. Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.497" offset="3289318">So I think certainly there's also double vexation in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.990" offset="3307290">The fact that there are adverse claimants, I think that probably Judge Dillon in the Adams case which has been refer to probably best states it, which he says it might by the same reasoning we said that a 100 persons that adrift in the ocean with but one small lifeboat in sight were not adverse to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.255" offset="3392345">We fear however that the concept of non-adversity would dwindle in direct proportion to the number of swimmers reaching the boat, and certainly that's the situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.332" offset="3432678">We have 37 claimants all of them want the $20,000 and all go adverse to one another and all we're really asking in this situation is that the court entertain jurisdiction in the nature of interpleader so that they will eliminate of multiplicity of suits, eliminate double vexation and that there will be an equable apportionment of the fund among the claimants.</text>
