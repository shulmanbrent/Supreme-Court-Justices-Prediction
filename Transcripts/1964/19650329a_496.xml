            <text syncTime="45.671" offset="287096">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.404" offset="302038">This case involves the validity of the Connecticut anti-contraceptives statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.759" offset="323459">There are two statutes involved, which are printed on page three of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.504" offset="346446">The first one, which I will refer to as the "use statute," provides that any person who uses any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception is guilty of a crime; and the second statute, the "accessory statute," provides that anyone who assists, abets, counsels, and so on, another to commit any offense may be punished as if he were the principal offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.072" offset="456683">There is no dispute concerning the facts of the case, at least so far as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.257" offset="481447">Following the decision of this Court in Poe against Ulmin in 1961, there was opened in New Haven the Planned Parenthood Center, and this was in November of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.245" offset="537349">The purpose of the Center was to provide information, instruction and medical advice to married persons as to the means of preventing conception, and to educate married persons generally as to such means and methods, that was the finding of the court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.198" offset="617179">Dr. Buxton, one of the appellants here, was medical director of the Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.820" offset="639645">Dr. Buxton is chief of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale Medical School, and one of the leading authorities in his field.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.810" offset="679664">Mrs. Griswold, the other appellant here, was acting director of the Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.901" offset="704010">She is executive director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut, and she was in charge of the administration of the Center and its educational program.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.577" offset="746747">The Center functioned in a suite of eight rooms in a building in New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.372" offset="769839">It had a staff of doctors and nurses, as well as Mrs. Griswold.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.921" offset="788125">The procedure was that, when a married woman came to the Center, she was interviewed, her case history was taken, and various forms of contraception were explained to her.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.099" offset="920827">There is no question in the case, but that the Center functioned only for the purpose of helping married women.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.481" offset="5190280">Let me first say one further thing in a preliminary way with respect to the interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.429" offset="5234061">The Connecticut courts are clear that the "use statute" has been – the use statute prohibits by criminal process any use of contraceptive devices for prevention of conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.345" offset="5301770">And there is no exception to that statute, it applies to married persons, to married couples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.179" offset="5325072">It applies to a woman whose health is such that a further pregnancy would be dangerous, or perhaps fatal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.116" offset="5356837">It applies even though there is a doctor's prescription based upon scientific and medical grounds, it applies without exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.490" offset="5402394">On the other hand, as I indicated, it is not an offense to sell these same devices for, or to use them for, purposes of preventing disease and the accessory statute prevents a doctor from prescribing them for prevention of conception and prevents their sale for prevention of conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.509" offset="5490479">Now, the Connecticut statute is a unique statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.043" offset="5504585">There is no other statute dealing with this problem that makes it a criminal offense to use contraceptive devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.226" offset="5533320">In that respect it is totally unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.861" offset="5543873">The only statute, other statute, which is somewhat comparable, is the Massachusetts statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.695" offset="5567175">The Massachusetts statute prohibits the sale or giving away or displaying of contraceptive devices for prevention of conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.489" offset="5606358">It is different in that it applies to the sale, not the use, but it is the same as the Connecticut statute in that it has been interpreted to apply without exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.460" offset="5642198">It applies to married persons, doctors, physicians, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.802" offset="5659648">Now, the statutes are collected in the appendix to the brief of the Planned – amicus brief for the Planned Parenthood Federation, here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.055" offset="5692667">I will not go into them further, except to say that there is no other statute, either state or Federal, which has been interpreted in this way or applied in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.245" offset="5753375">Either by express language of the statute or by judicial interpretation, or by application of the executive officials charged with enforcement, all the other statutes allow at least the use of contraceptives for purposes of preventing conception and their sale on doctor's prescription or through some pharmaceutical arrangement or something of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="1524.886" offset="6203935">Only Massachusetts law would have been violated by the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.077" offset="6224729">The Minnesota and the New York laws prohibit sale, except on a doctor's prescription, and the wording is, "for use – for the cure or prevention of disease."</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.299" offset="6281571">They can be sold in Minnesota and New York on doctor's prescription for the cure and prevention of disease, but the court in New York in the Sanger case and in later cases has interpreted that language to mean, "for the purpose of promoting general health and well-being."</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.382" offset="6345937">So that New York does have birth control clinics operating in New York City and the New York – and the Minnesota statute similarly is classified as statutes allowing sale on prescription of physician for purposes of general health and well-being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.643" offset="6430992">The Mississippi, Missouri and Nebraska statutes do on their face sound like the Massachusetts statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.693" offset="6467145">They are statutes prohibiting sale, but they have never been interpreted that way, well I'm not sure there are any court decisions, they have never been applied that way in those States, and there are in those States birth control clinics operating, either by the government or by Planned Parenthood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.332" offset="6541751">So that, although on their face those statutes would apply, they have never been utilized in that way, and the Center would have been allowed to operate in those States.</text>
