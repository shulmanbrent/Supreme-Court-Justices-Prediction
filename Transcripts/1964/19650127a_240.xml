            <text syncTime="45.156" offset="180558">In the Chicago area, the employment terms of butchers and meat departments, all governed by collective bargaining agreements entered into between meat cutters locals and the food store operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.016" offset="248059">Central to the question in this case is a provision in those agreements which read like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.901" offset="283585">Market operating hours shall be 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. Monday through Saturday inclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.635" offset="322456">No customer shall be served who comes into the market before or after the hours set forth above.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.560" offset="362162">It is said that this agreement is a contract in restraint of trade and violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.176" offset="408660">On the merits of this claim, there are two ways into this problem, one, through the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.620" offset="450456">In our view, based upon the findings and the record, the limitation upon marketing operating hours is with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.312" offset="513149">It is a mandatory bargaining subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.830" offset="527256">And it is our position that an agreement upon a mandatory bargaining subject is not within the coverage of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.406" offset="565603">An agreement with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment is not an agreement in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.362" offset="621401">If we first establish and we have to establish by a record showing what this agreement is about, if we first establish that it is mandatory bargaining subject, then it is our position that under no circumstances does it come within the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.083" offset="720248">When one says it's being used as a façade, I think you will go to a question as to whether or not it is a mandatory bargaining subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.696" offset="754730">I think that might be relevant to the ascertainment whether the agreement is with respect to wages, hours or other terms and conditions of employment or is in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.780" offset="795063">But it seems to us that once you establish that it is upon a mandatory bargaining subject, then nothing else is relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.069" offset="832261">In our case here in Jewel, it happens that the same evidence which establishes that it's a mandatory bargaining subject also establishes that it is within the labor exemption if you look at this case via the Norris-La Guardia Act and Clayton Act exemptions in the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.385" offset="1325453">It is not an agreement with respect, in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.328" offset="1341231">Now, it seems to me that difference between a hypothetical that Your Honor suggests and the one that Mr. Justice Goldberg suggests is precisely the difference between the subjects of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.077" offset="1384281">The subjects in Your Honors hypothetical, as I understand it pertained to wages, hours, and working conditions and employers can combine on those subjects.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.464" offset="1577796">In this case, the second way into the case is via the labor exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.425" offset="1597649">We can assume in this case that the market operating hours provision is a restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.670" offset="1626593">It's an undue restriction on commercial competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.252" offset="1688973">On those facts, it would make no difference whether you were dealing with a restraint of trade or whether you're dealing with the wage hour and working condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.374" offset="1721469">And that is why on our view of our case, we have two strings to our bow; one, we are dealing with wages, hours, and working conditions under the National Labor Relations Act and therefore we are out of the Sherman Act all together.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.123" offset="2032431">We say it's wages hours, and working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.084" offset="2044238">Jewel says it's a restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.631" offset="2054478">We think that means that this question should have first been before the National Labor Relations Board as the body which the Congress has set off to decide whether a subject is or is not a mandatory bargaining subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.308" offset="2117172">We think, therefore, that this complaint had no business in the District Court without prior recourse of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.651" offset="2146534">But now as to the finding of fact, I want to read to the Court the ultimate finding of fact of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.992" offset="2183941">That this appears on page 672 just above the -- probably on number 198.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.400" offset="2225528">We have in this case two volumes of record and we're talking about Volume I pertaining to the testimony and the exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.024" offset="2260010">The union's insistence on the retention of the marketing hour restriction was based upon its desire to protect its right not to work at night and to protect its work from being taken by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.681" offset="2330645">Those facts and circumstances are inimical to plaintiff's theory that the unions insisted on the restriction as the tool of the employer group and at their behest.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.387" offset="2381531">On the contrary, the evidence establish that the restriction was imposed after arms length bargaining including an overwhelming strike vote against night work, and was fashioned exclusively by the unions to serve their own interests, how long and what hours members shall work, what work they shall do, and what pay they shall receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.713" offset="2494798">These are not objects which the antitrust laws prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.830" offset="2511308">They are conditions of employment and as such are clearly within the labor exemption of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.411" offset="2541610">This is the ultimate finding effect in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.078" offset="2560209">This finding having been undisturbed is dispositive of the claim that the unions on any theory have violated the antitrust laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.483" offset="3053923">It meant this proposal that their work would be done with others unskilled in the trade since the evidence showed that in stores where meat is sold at night, it is impractical to operate without either butchers or other employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="963.247" offset="3852957">That is -- the evidence in Indiana is the evidence of cheating we uncovered here.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.868" offset="3875422">On either Tuesday or Wednesday night, when they were supposed to be operating this meat department without employees, one of our people went into that store.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.163" offset="3912620">There were two grocery clerks in the cooling room of the meat department.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.637" offset="3930488">Our witness asked for a runt roast and the grocery clerks brought out two to ask him to make a selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.470" offset="3957864">This is cheating.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.723" offset="3962880">This is what happens in Indiana where supposedly you operate a meat department at night without employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.605" offset="3990361">But furthermore, taking Indiana on Jewels' own representation, the record shows as clearly as anything can be shown that even in little Hammond, Gary area in Indiana which is what we are talking about, you always have a meat cutter on duty at least Thursday and Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.614" offset="4082416">You may have a meat cutter on duty other nights of the week depending on the volume of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.935" offset="4107703">And the only time you do not have a meat cutter on duty is when business is light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.935" offset="4131736">So when business is brisk and the only time therefore that night operation makes any difference, you always have a meat cutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.748" offset="4162978">Now, this is what Jewel's chief negotiator said in his deposition which he did not disclaim at the trial about the so-called operation in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.409" offset="4205610">He said in Lake County, Indiana, we are required to have a meat cutter on duty only on Thursdays and Fridays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.350" offset="4245316">We are usually open five nights a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.751" offset="4259004">We usually have a meat cutter on duty Mondays and Tuesdays in addition to Thursdays and Fridays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.890" offset="4287530">Wednesday is a pretty light night and some of our markets will not have a meat cutter on duty on those nights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.346" offset="4317309">This was the information known to Jewels' chief negotiator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.799" offset="4335177">This was obviously the information on which he was acting when he was negotiating with the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.232" offset="4356911">And it is simply fictitious to assume that either Jewel's negotiators or anybody else were negotiating the subject of market operating hours on the artificial assumption that you could in truth operate a self service meat department without employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.128" offset="4424411">In fact, that proposal and the only proposal that was ever made to that effect were made by Jewel in 1961 in the last minute of contract negotiations when the negotiations were breaking up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.197" offset="4480731">A serious proposal is not made in the last moment when negotiations were breaking up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.368" offset="4505391">No other proposal of that kind was made in 1957, 1959 or 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.211" offset="4536842">What we have here, therefore, is a question as to whether the man must work at night and whether their work will be taken over by others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.530" offset="4586057">Now, this goes back a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.403" offset="4597551">This goes back to November 1919 more than 45 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.888" offset="4631510">In 1919, the meat departments in Chicago were operated 81 hours a week, seven days a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.308" offset="4669231">The meat departments were operated from seven in the morning to seven at night, Monday through Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.511" offset="4693995">They were operated from seven in the morning to 10 at night on Saturday but they were operated from seven in the morning to one in the afternoon on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.657" offset="4738612">In November 1919, the union called a strike that was Local 546 which is now the biggest local and was then, I believe, the only local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.396" offset="4777482">They called a strike and the object of the strike was expressed in four words; more money, less hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.863" offset="4811442">And what they wanted on less hours was one hour off in the morning, one hour off at night, and no Sunday hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.520" offset="4846028">That strike lasted for eight days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.360" offset="4857417">They want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.959" offset="4863791">At the end of the strike, marketing and working hours were in Chicago placed at 8 A.M. to 7 P.M.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.615" offset="4898377">Monday through Saturday -- oh that is 8 A.M. to 7 P.M. Monday through Friday, 8 A.M. to 9 P.M. on Saturday and no Sunday hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.157" offset="4936620">Year 1920 was the year at least so far as we were able to uncover files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.542" offset="4958145">This far back was the first written contract we could find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.212" offset="4976744">What was written in 1920 in the collective bargaining agreement pertaining to meat cutters in the Chicago area remains the kind of agreement we have now with the only difference being the hours which are presently limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.354" offset="5037349">In 1920, this was the agreement, nine hours shall constitute the basic working day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.267" offset="5069009">Hours shall be 8 A.M. to 6 P.M. except in Saturdays and days preceding holidays beginning at 8 A.M. and quitting at 9 P.M.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.180" offset="5108715">It is expressly understood that no customers will be served to come into the market after 6 P.M. and 9 P.M. on Saturdays and on days preceding the holiday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.872" offset="5163468">The first written agreement combine marketing hours and working hours that combination exists in every agreement in the Chicago area through the one that exists today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.823" offset="5207249">In 1937, the hours on Saturday were reduced from 9 P.M. to 7 P.M.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.549" offset="5238178">In 1941, the hours on Saturday were reduced to 6 P.M.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.052" offset="5260121">In 1945, they were reduced on Saturday to 3 P.M.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.776" offset="5279033">In 1946, to 1 P.M.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.395" offset="5293558">In 1947, the short day on Saturday was discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.608" offset="5314351">It went back to 6 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.958" offset="5323755">It's been that way ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.643" offset="5334518">The agreements are explicit marketing hours and working hours stops at 6 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.843" offset="5363357">And the reason they stop at 6 o'clock, and the reason they were regulated in 1919 as a result of the strike is because the men do not want to work at night.</text>
