            <label>Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104598">Justice Kennedy has the opinion of the court in case 07-343, Kennedy versus Louisiana.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="9.607" stopTime="465.319">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.607" offset="142946">In this case, the petitioner was convicted by a Louisiana jury of raping his stepdaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.370" offset="170009">She was eight years old at the time of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.908" offset="180144">In addition to mental anguish, she sustained serious physical injuries, injuries that required emergency surgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.397" offset="214103">These are described in detail in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.815" offset="227791">The petitioner was sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.521" offset="234583">He challenged his sentence as cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighteenth Amendment, that provision is applicable to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.845" offset="267916">The Supreme Court of Louisiana upheld the constitutionality of petitioner's death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.623" offset="287037">We granted certiorari to resolve the question, whether the Eight Amendment bars Louisiana from imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child where the crime did not result, and did not -- was not intended to result in the death of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.525" offset="342626">The Eight Amendment requires a punishment for a crime be graduated and proportioned to the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.116" offset="369062">We determined whether this requirement has been fulfilled not by the standards that prevailed when the Eight Amendment was adopted in 1791, but by considering the standards of decency that marked the progress of our maturing society.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.774" offset="431651">The opinion discusses the precedents which control our Eight Amendment analysis in the case and the opinion discusses a number of Supreme Court precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.477" offset="466446">Three of the principal cases we discussed in the opinion are these, two are recent ones, Roper versus Simmons, that case held that the death penalty cannot be applied to a person who was under 18 when the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.785" offset="527677">And another is Atkins versus Virginia holding the penalty cannot be imposed on a mentally retarded person.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.058" offset="552755">Then there is this third case that we will discuss briefly here, which is Coker versus Georgia an older case dating from 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.658" offset="591207">In Coker, the Court held that the death penalty could not be imposed for the rape of an adult, where the crime did not result and was not intended to result in the death of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.280" offset="625689">The case before us, of course, involves the rape of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.322" offset="641885">In these and other cases discussed in the opinion, the Court was guided by objective indicia of society's standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice with respect to executions.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.151" offset="685143">We follow that same approach here, based both on consensus and our own independent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.931" offset="708236">Our holding is that this sentence does violate the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments, the Louisiana statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.698" offset="743344">The opinion reviews the history and present status of state law on the issue of capital punishment for child rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.752" offset="771556">Six states now permit the death penalty for this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.955" offset="788379">By contrast, 45 jurisdiction, 44 States plus the Federal Government prohibit the execution of child rapist.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.260" offset="821607">Our opinion compares these statistics with the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.724" offset="831429">The Court relied upon in Roper and Atkins, and in the felony murder case Enmund versus Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.055" offset="860791">Though our review of national consensus is not confined to tallying the number of States with applicable death penalty legislation, it is of significance that the number of jurisdiction that would prohibit petitioner's execution exceeds the number of jurisdictions, we considered in those earlier precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.925" offset="932262">The opinion also relies upon other measures of consensus including statistics about the number of executions.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.540" offset="954727">No individual has been executed for the rape of an adult or child since 1964, and no execution for any other non-homicide offense has taken place since 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.310" offset="997777">Louisiana is the only State since the Court's 1972 decision in Furman that has sentenced an individual to death for the crime of child rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.455" offset="1034348">Petitioner is one of only two individuals now on death row in the United States for a non-homicide offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.231" offset="1065486">The State of Louisiana has argued that states have felt constrained by this Court's holding in Coker.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.725" offset="1087429">The State says that this is blocked, the development of legislative consensus.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.184" offset="1105297">We see no clear indication of this for the reasons discussed at length in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.411" offset="1130165">Furthermore, consensus has never been dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.555" offset="1138734">In the end, our judgment -- in our own judgment must be brought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the death penalty under the Eight Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.233" offset="1177499">It is obvious that the rape in this case caused the victim prolonged physical and mental suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.261" offset="1201636">Nonetheless, the constitutional prohibition against excessive or cruel and unusual punishments mandates that the State's power to punish be exercised in accordance with evolving standards of decency in the maturing society.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.926" offset="1256285">It’s an established principle that decency, in its essence, presumes respect for the individual and thus moderation or restraint in the application of capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.441" offset="1306335">Difficulties in administering the penalty to ensure against its arbitrary and capricious application require a caution at this stage of evolving standards and expanding the death penalty to an area where standards to confine its use are indefinite and obscure.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.585" offset="1366835">We find significant the number of executions that would be allowed under respondent's approach approximately 5,702 incidents of rape of a child under the age of 12 were reported nationwide in the year 2005.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.112" offset="1429006">This is almost twice the total incidence of intentional murder for victims of all ages reported during the same period.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.219" offset="1461398">We do sanction the death penalty for this rape offense, the number of permissible executions could not be reconciled with our evolving standards of decency and the necessity to constrain the use of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.871" offset="1508000">We hold that as it relates to violent offenses against individual persons, the death penalty is disproportionate and an excessive punishment where death did not result from the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.752" offset="1551573">Our ruling is consistent with justifications offered for the death penalty, true, we cannot say that the death penalty will serve no retributive or deterrent function in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.231" offset="1593473">But a number of factors demonstrate the serious negative consequences of making child rape a capital offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.475" offset="1622417">Seeking the death penalty for child rape forces a moral choice on the child victim who testifies.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.978" offset="1644464">She is not of mature age to make that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.223" offset="1657421">In addition, the problem of unreliable, induced, or even imagined to child testimony, heightens the risk of wrongful convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.480" offset="1690440">There also is the problem of under reporting of child rape, which diminishes the penalty’s deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.894" offset="1716144">And by making the punishment for child rape and murder equivalent, a State that punishes child rape by death may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.550" offset="1758776">One last point there as mentioned, it’s been argued that our determination that the death penalty for child rape is unconstitutional, will block further consensus in favor of the penalty from developing.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.507" offset="1802557">This concern overlooks the meaning and full substance of the established proposition that the Eight Amendment is defined by the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, and that principle requires that use of the death penalty be limited and restrained, and reserved for the worst offenders and offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.278" offset="1873610">In most cases, justice is not better served by terminating the life of the perpetrator rather than confining him and preserving the possibility of rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.601" offset="1906942">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana has reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.660" offset="1919168">The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.480" offset="1934423">Justice Alito has filed the dissenting opinion, in which the Chief Justice and Justice Scalia and Thomas have joined.</text>
