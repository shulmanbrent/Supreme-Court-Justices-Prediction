            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="10.280" offset="145954">If you can bear with me, I -- I can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.678" offset="163509">This case is hereon writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.750" offset="191826">District of Columbia law bans handgun possession by making it a crime to carry an unregistered firearm, prohibiting the registration of handguns and providing separately that no person may carry a handgun not licensed by the chief of police who was authorized to issue one year licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.180" offset="265595">In addition, it requires residents to keep lawfully owned firearms which would include long guns, unloaded and dissembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.018" offset="316900">Respondent Heller, a D.C. special policeman, applied to register a handgun he wished to keep at home, but the District refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.721" offset="351695">He filed this suit seeking, on Second Amendment grounds, to enjoin the city from enforcing the ban on handgun registration, the licensing requirement insofar as it prohibits carrying an unlicensed firearm in the home and the trigger-lock requirement insofar as it prohibits the use of functional firearms in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.020" offset="428913">The District Court dismissed the suit, but the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed, holding that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to posses firearms and that the city's total ban on handguns, as well as its requirement that firearms in the home be kept nonfunctional even when necessary for self defense, violated this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.309" offset="514072">The Court of Appeals directed the District Court to enter summary judgment for respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.186" offset="533612">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirm the judgment of the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.384" offset="554405">We hold that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to have unused arms for self defense in the home and that the District's handgun ban as well as its requirement that firearms in the home be rendered inoperative, violates that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.784" offset="611979">Our opinion is very lengthy examining in detail, the text and history of the Second Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.757" offset="635907">This summary that I'm giving will state little more than the conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.524" offset="650954">If you want to check their validity against the dissents' contrary claims, you will have to read some 154 pages of opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.278" offset="689928">The Second Amendment provides "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="157.944" offset="736635">The interpretive difficulty and what causes some people to think that it confers only a collective, rather than an individual right, and others including the petitioners here to think that it isn't individual right but only to keep and bear arms for service in a militia.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.131" offset="813331">The interpretive difficulty that produces those positions is of course the prologue, a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.669" offset="859515">It's a standard principle of interpretation and was in 1791 that a prologue cannot limit the scope of the operative text which often goes beyond the narrow purpose set forth in a prologue.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.026" offset="912910">It would be peculiar, however, for the prologue positively to contradict the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.499" offset="938823">So, we examine first the operative portion of the amendment, namely, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.975" offset="972782">We conclude after examining many uses of keep arms and bear arms, contemporaneous with and prior to the adoption of the Second Amendment that it means pretty much what it means today to have and carry weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.678" offset="1031506">Those old sources refute the notion that bear arms alone or keep in bear arms in combination has an exclusively military connotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.504" offset="1066823">To be sure when one was a soldier, he bore arms, but one could bear arms without being a soldier.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.436" offset="1094617">The same conclusion that the phrase does not refer to military service is demanded by the fact that it was universally understood that the Second Amendment incorporated in to the Federal Constitution, a preexisting right of Englishman set forth in the 1689 English Bill of Rights, that's why it reads shall not be infringed, the right shall not be infringed, referring to a preexisting right and everybody agrees with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.427" offset="1206526">There is no doubt that the English right was an individual right to have and carry arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.223" offset="1233693">We then turn to the prologue to see if it is incompatible with the interpretation we have given the operative clause, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.108" offset="1269220">In fact, that interpretation that she is the object of the prologue more effectively than would a mere right to have and bear arms in an organized militia.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.313" offset="1314046">The militia consisted of all male citizens capable of military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.936" offset="1332541">That was thought to be a protection against, not only attack from abroad, but tyranny at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.932" offset="1356573">In the events that had given rise to the English Bill of Rights, the Stuart Kings had not abolished the people's militia, but had simply taken away the people's arms or the arms of their opponents, leaving in place only a standing army and a select militia dominated by their own supporters.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.557" offset="1443091">The lesson learned, if the people cannot have arms, there will be no people's militia.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.221" offset="1469736">That perception is what joins the two part of -- the two parts of the Second Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.468" offset="1490738">The mere right to keep and bear arms in a State organized militia does not solve the problem because of the state court like the Stuart Kings limit the organized militia to its own people.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.712" offset="1539639">So, what the Second Amendment means is since we need a people's militia, the people will not be deprived of the right to keep and bear arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.095" offset="1577256">This interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms bearing rights in state constitutions that preceeded and immediately followed the adoption of the Second Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.904" offset="1620410">Of the four States that had analogues to the Federal Second Amendment before the Constitution was ratified, two clearly conferred individual rights unconnected to militia service specifying the people's right to bear arms for their own defense and the most likely reading is that the other two also secured an individual right to bear arms for defensive purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.916" offset="1712466">Similarly of the nine States -- of the nine State analogues to the Second Amendment that were adopted between 1789 and 1820, seven referred to the people's right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State or to the citizens right to bear arms in defense of himself and the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.838" offset="1800237">The final two of those nine -- of those nine were ambiguous but were interpreted by the state courts to confer an individual right to bear arms for lawful purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.251" offset="1849870">Our opinion then looks at legal interpretations of the Second Amendment from immediately after its ratification through the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.793" offset="1888008">We find that that scholars, including the most famous ones, Tucker, Rolls, Storey and Cooley, the adjudicated cases, congressional legislation and the statements of congressional legislators, universally, took the right to be a personal one unconnected to militia service.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.869" offset="1960315">The one exception is a minor scholar who acknowledged that his view had been rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.503" offset="1982885">As one might expect, after the civil war, the right of the former slaves, a new freemen to bear arms was a significant issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.092" offset="2017158">Let me read from a joint congressional report dated 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.746" offset="2039832">In some parts of South Carolina, armed parties are without proper authority, engaged in seizing all firearms found in the hands of freemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.326" offset="2078180">Such conduct is in clear and direct violation of their personal rights as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States which declares that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.312" offset="2130111">The congressional act creating the Freedmen's Bureau on July 16, 1866 stated the right to have full and equal benefit of all laws in proceedings concerning personal liberty and personal security including the constitutional right to bear arms shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens without respect to race or color or previous condition of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.000" offset="2228854">It was good to have a gun when -- when the clansmen came.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.680" offset="2247558">Our opinion next turns to whether any prior decisions of this Court preclude the interpretation we have just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.550" offset="2283084">We conclude that none does.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.637" offset="2291339">I will only describe one of those cases on which the dissent places its principle reliance and that is our decision in United States versus Miller rendered in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.250" offset="2337837">The judgment in that case upheld against a Second Amendment challenge, two men's federal convictions for transporting an unregistered sawed off shut gun in interstate commerce in violation of the National Firearms Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.130" offset="2401367">It is entirely clear that the Court's basis for saying that the Second Amendment did not prevent the conviction was not that the defendants were bearing arms privately rather than in a militia, rather it was that the type of weapon that issued was not illegible for Second Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.728" offset="2479734">"In the absence of any evidence tending to show that the possession or use of a short barreled shotgun at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument."</text>
            <text syncTime="614.598" offset="2563221">Certainly, the Court continued, “It is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense."</text>
            <text syncTime="626.461" offset="2610660">Beyond that, the opinion provided no explanation of the content of the right to keep and bear arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.694" offset="2643574">This holding is not only consistent with but positively suggests that the Second Amendment confers a right to keep and bear arms for lawful private purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.840" offset="2684221">Had the Court believed that the Second Amendment protects only those service -- those serving in the militia, it would have been odd to examine the character of the weapon rather than simply note that the two crooks were not militia men.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.281" offset="2745974">Miller stands only for the proposition that the Second Amendment right, whatever its nature, extends only to certain types of weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.381" offset="2778366">It is particularly wrong headed to read Miller for more than what it said because the case did not even purport to be a thorough examination of the Second Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.057" offset="2821102">The respondent made no appearance in the case, neither filing a brief nor appearing at oral argument, the Court heard from no one but the Government, reason enough, one would think not to make that case the beginning and the end of this Court's consideration of the Second Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.728" offset="2883796">The Government's Miller brief provided scant discussion of the history of the Second Amendment and the Court was presented with no counter discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.921" offset="2916501">As for the text of the Court's opinion, that -- as for the text of the Court's opinion itself, that discusses none of the history of the Second Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.537" offset="2959029">It assumes from the prologue that the amendment was designed to preserve the militia which we do not dispute and then we view some historical materials dealing with the nature of the militia and in particular with the nature of the arms their members were expected to posses, not a word, not a word about the history of the Second Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.978" offset="3040740">The next section of our opinion points out that like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.685" offset="3063623">It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever, in any manner whatsoever, and for whatever purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.149" offset="3093403">For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the amendment or state analogues.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.032" offset="3117017">Our opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on long standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.821" offset="3192146">Miller is holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those "in common use of the time," finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.175" offset="3245540">We make no attempt to provide and no excuse for not providing extensive historical justification for those regulations of the right that we describe as permissible since this case represents the Court's first in-depth examination of the Second Amendment, one should not expect it to clarify the entire field.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.519" offset="3318892">There will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for these exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.206" offset="3357657">Finally, we come to our disposition of the case, the District's handgun ban and the trigger lock requirement, at least as applied to immediate self defense which is all that the respondent asked for, violates the Second Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.722" offset="3411679">The District's total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to prohibition all of -- of an entire class of arms that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.510" offset="3462879">Under any of the standards of scrutiny, the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition in the place where the need for lawful defense of self, family and property is most acute would fail constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.526" offset="3526931">Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self defense and is hence unconstitutional, because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D.C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for reliefs -- for relief and so we do not address the licensing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.213" offset="3653677">Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights by being a felon or mentally ill for example, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.555" offset="3723058">We are aware of the problem of handgun violence in this country and we take seriously the concerns raised by the many Amici who believe that prohibition of handgun ownership is a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.100" offset="3769243">The Constitution leaves the District of Columbia a variety of tools for combating that problem including some measures regulating handguns, but the Second Amendment necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.863" offset="3828279">These include the absolute prohibition of handguns held and used for self defense in the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.101" offset="3857223">Undoubtedly, some think that the Second Amendment is outmoded in a society where our standing armies in pride of our nation where a well-trained police forces provide personal security and where a gun violence is a serious problem, that is perhaps debatable.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.750" offset="3927858">But what is not debatable is that it is not the role of this Court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.285" offset="3957951">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.480" offset="3970803">Justice Stevens has filed the dissenting opinion in which Justices Souter, Ginsberg and Breyer have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.727" offset="3995777">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter and Ginsberg have joined.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="981.687" stopTime="1434.149">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="981.687" offset="4031617">The two dissenting opinions that Justice Breyer and I have filed set forth independent reasons for concluding that the Court is quite wrong today.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.851" offset="4080204">The fact that individuals may enforce the right protected by the Second Amendment tells us nothing about the scope of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.423" offset="4118552">Guns are used to hunt, for self defense, to commit crimes, for sporting activities and to perform military duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.094" offset="4153243">The Second Amendment plainly does not protect the right to use a gun to rob a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.069" offset="4173096">It is equally clear that it does encompass the right to use weapons for certain military purposes, Whether it also protects the right to -- to posses and use guns for non-military purposes like hunting and personal self defense is the question presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.066" offset="4249060">Rather than attempt to summarize my lengthy opinion, I shall merely identify eight reasons why most judges would endorse the narrower, militia related reading of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.404" offset="4306425">First, it is the most natural reading of the 27-word text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.766" offset="4327950">That text protects the right to keep and bear arms and makes no mention of any non-military use of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.969" offset="4364730">It protects the preexisting right to use guns by members of a militia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.334" offset="4390226">The centerpiece of the Court's analysis of the text today is its assumption that the words "the people" describe the same class of persons as those words described in the First and Fourth Amendments, all members of the political community, not in unspecified subset like just the militia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.415" offset="4482490">But it is well established that the people protected by the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment include convicted felons and mentally incompetent persons and many that are not capable of handling firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.939" offset="4540586">The Court assures us, however, that law abiding and responsible citizens are the only subset of people entitled to bear arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.930" offset="4580606">But that assurance which comes at the end of the opinion totally eviscerates the basis for the Court's elaborate attempt to justify its claim that the text means more than it says and serves a purpose far broader than that identified in its preamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.747" offset="4651868">Second, if the text were ambiguous and the long discussion of language in the Court's opinion may support its clearer that it is ambiguous at the very least, I don't think it is ambiguous, but if it were, the clear statement of purpose in its preamble would provide the basis for -- for resolving any ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.771" offset="4735878">The preamble clearly contemplates the use of arms in a militia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.996" offset="4756776">Third, the principle draftsman of the amendment, James Madison, not man who wrote generations later and commentators and so, James Madison and those who participated in the deliberations leading to the enactment of the amendment considered and rejected proposal similar to those contained in some contemporary State Constitutions which the majority opinion quotes at length which would have protected none military uses of weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.585" offset="4879133">Thus a fair analysis of the original intent of the framers of the amendment supports a narrower reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.860" offset="4912257">Fourth, it is the reading that this Court adopted in 1939 in Miller, an unanimous opinion which speaks for itself, do not accept the summary of the opinion you have just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.234" offset="4965755">For example, the concern about only one party participating in the argument was also true of Marbury against Madison, a case which should not be ignored just for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.507" offset="5010895">The word stare decisis which do not appear in the majority opinion today would normally compel -- would normally counsel adherence to settled law.</text>
