            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">We'll hear arguments first this morning in No. 1844, City of Mobile against Bolden and the consolidated case of Williams against Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.837" offset="151782">Mr. Rhyne, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Charles S. Rhyne</label>
            <text syncTime="19.427" offset="182084">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.561" offset="194623">This case presents a question of whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the abolition of the Mobile commission form of government elected at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.117" offset="256899">This is the first case involving a state or a local government where the entire form of government, not just the manner of its election, has been held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.548" offset="330564">Mobile is one-third black.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.086" offset="348745">The District Court held that only the abolition of the commission form of government in its entirety could "provide blacks a realistic opportunity to elect blacks to the city governing board."</text>
            <text syncTime="85.802" offset="447592">The District Court also held that equal opportunity included the election of representatives of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.167" offset="501091">Now, the ultimate issue in this case is whether the only way to satisfy the Constitutional requirement of equal protection -- or equal participation in the voting processes of a government is by electing a black to the Mobile governing body.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.079" offset="612686">Now, the District Court held that while it was making all of the findings about various subjects that I just mentioned, that blacks did not participate effectively, and we say this is a clearly erroneous error because the record establishes beyond question that in every contested election in the City of Mobile, and the last one was in 1973, the black vote is decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.881" offset="775899">In 1973, for example, Commissioner Greenough ran against Commissioner Bailey, who had defeated Commissioner Langan, who had been elected and re-elected 16 years with black support.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.537" offset="838593">And in the first election he received only 15% of the black vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.629" offset="862939">In the runoff he received 43 and not elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.187" offset="881121">And as we state and quote on pages 9 and 10 of our brief, the judge is questioning Reverend Hope, who is the black president of the Non-Partisan Voters League, and he asked him, "Isn't it a fact that the black vote in the Greenough race was the difference, and in the Mims race, the other commissioner?”</text>
            <text syncTime="222.967" offset="996268">And he said, "Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="224.626" offset="1002851">And then in addition to that, I would point out to the Court that Commissioner Doyle had no opposition but he testified that when he first ran, that he went to the Non-Partisan Voters League, which is the only slating organization in Mobile and it's black.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.467" offset="1082264">And he was screened by them and they endorsed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.764" offset="1099504">And each one of these appellants have gone to that league and received its endorsement after being screened by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.072" offset="1140673">And so the blacks do participate very vigorously in the electoral processes of Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.895" offset="1179961">And so I say that where the elections are -- are non-partisan and where each of the appellants go and seek the black vote, and where it's decisive, it cannot be said to be submerged or diluted.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.946" offset="1264180">Now, the Reverend Hope, when he was testifying in his final statement that we quote on page 10, makes just one sentence which I would like to quote to the Court because I think it's important, because he was talking about the fact that he was speaking for the entire League, which is all -- all black and the most important slating organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.366" offset="1357908">He said, "They feel the candidates they have elected" -- now these are the three appellants who are here, and by "they" he means the Non-Partisan Voting League -- "have done a very good job along that line of -- of serving blacks."</text>
            <text syncTime="333.388" offset="1437947">And over and over again this record is full of instances in which blacks testified that when they supported these appellants, they went down to City Hall and they asked for what they wanted, and if it was possible in law and money, they got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.482" offset="1542332">And I'm not going to read the long list, but I can say this, eight, the only eight of the witnesses of the plaintiffs who were asked if they'd been down to City Hall, and under this open door policy that's maintained by these commissioners who exercise dual functions under the commission form of government, they have both legislative and executive powers so they can in effect do it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.688" offset="1663122">They -- if they tell one of these blacks, "We're -- you're going to get a pavement."</text>
            <text syncTime="394.837" offset="1683707">"You're going to get this."</text>
            <text syncTime="396.922" offset="1692066">They get it because they have the power to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.076" offset="1704709">And so the fact that they not only take part in the entire voting process from registration all the way through but they then in effect collect on their political obligations shows that they play an extremely important part in the political processes of Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.640" offset="1807005">Now, we had one time in 1973 where three blacks ran and those three blacks didn't carry the black wards.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.943" offset="1864161">Now, as witness Alexander, Dan Alexander who is a witness for the plaintiff, testified in his testimony for the plaintiff, an election for a commissioner and an election for the school board are two entirely different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.898" offset="1943991">When you run for the school board, and Dan Alexander is a member of the school board, you talk about what you can do for the school kids and it's county-wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.408" offset="1978055">When you run for commissioner, you talk about what a good businessman or woman you are because the commission form of government is supposed to elect businessmen to run cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.098" offset="2020791">That's why it came into existence and that's why over and over again when they've had referendums in Mobile -- well, they've had them in 1963 and 1973, according to -- to the record, the people have overwhelmingly supported this businessman form of local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.877" offset="2107935">Now, the Court below held that the intent that was important here was not the intent of the three defendants but the intent of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.804" offset="2163628">Now, the legislature is not a defendant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.693" offset="2175122">No state official is a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.515" offset="2186407">And they go on and on and on talking about bills that have gone up to Montgomery to change the form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.590" offset="2226740">And when you're talking about legislative intent you're talking about a very nebulous thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.834" offset="2247743">But in their supplemental brief they cited the fact that Senator Buskey, a black Senator, had introduced a bill to give the people of Mobile a chance to vote on another referendum about changing its government and they go on and on about how the fact that that bill went through the House and then lost in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.485" offset="2346381">What they don't tell you is this, that that bill reached the Senate on its 28th legislative day.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.694" offset="2387132">It got its first reading that very day which is very unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.135" offset="2408970">It got its second reading, and this is on page 10 and 11 that they discuss this, its second reading on the 29th legislative day.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.408" offset="2450035">And then it got lost in the usual pile-up of bills in State legislatures on that last day.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.690" offset="2487129">The thing that -- that interests me is that the black Senator from Mobile, according to the journal, had absolutely nothing to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.507" offset="2518476">The bill died.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.843" offset="2523805">Now -- but again, it was a -- going to give the people of Mobile a chance to have a referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.121" offset="2552853">So I urge upon the Court that the relevant intent that you're going to consider intent is that of the three defendants, the three commissioners that are before you, and you can't find in this record, if you read it from beginning to end, any instance in which they who must have the votes of the blacks to win have discriminated against the blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.930" offset="2656089">The black's votes are equally counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.275" offset="2665493">They have an open door policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.808" offset="2671658">They see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.965" offset="2676255">And as I say, the only eight witnesses of the plaintiff who were asked testified unequivocally that when they went to City Hall, they saw the appellants and they got what they went for if it was legally or financially possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.545" offset="2738531">And so it's not the state intent that's so important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.085" offset="2756712">It is the intent of these three appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.755" offset="2767370">If it was the state intent, why don't they have the state here?</text>
            <text syncTime="669.490" offset="2782312">Yet the very basis of the District Court decisions and the very basis of the Appellate Court decision is the inference that they draw from the fact that no black, and the District Court repeats this three times, has ever won a seat as commissioner of Mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.071" offset="2864650">He doesn't add the next part of it which is that no qualified blacks ever run.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.041" offset="2884608">And the other inference they draw is that state inaction is circumstantial evidence of invidious intent against what?</text>
            <text syncTime="703.277" offset="2917522">These three appellants?</text>
            <text syncTime="704.103" offset="2920761">What do they have to do with the -- the state legislature's intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="707.760" offset="2935390">And it's the most nebulous, hardest thing to get at in the whole world.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.990" offset="2952317">It's like asking Barry Goldwater what Senator McGovern's intent was on a bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.829" offset="2975723">I -- I don't believe that the relevant intent is that of the state legislature but the relevant intent is that of the appellant commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.629" offset="3010936">They're the only defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.707" offset="3015220">They're the only ones that are before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.373" offset="3025878">And so I urge indeed that they have never been shown to have a racial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.685" offset="3051165">They have been shown over and over again to be very sensitive to the needs of blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.379" offset="3085960">And there is no racial purpose that can be attributed to them in any way or how can they get over and over the endorsement of the blacks and how can they, when these only three blacks ran, carry even the black wards?</text>
            <text syncTime="761.714" offset="3151266">So another point that I would make is that the Court of Appeals held that there was a very strong city governmental intent in at-large elections in Mobile because they were brought in to wipe out ward healing, corrupt government, and that this -- this government has served Mobile well for 68 years without any charges of corruption or -- or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.581" offset="3286685">And that is the good government that they're asking this Court to uphold the abolition of.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.428" offset="3322107">Now, the failure of the court below to find this -- that in this record over and over again that the blacks are such an important element of the political processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.917" offset="3384069">They get on the stand and they brag about how important they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.578" offset="3402668">Wiley Bolden said, “Sure, they follow the pink sheet.”</text>
            <text syncTime="829.753" offset="3423357">That the pink sheet is the one that has the names of the people that the blacks have endorsed.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.107" offset="3444778">And when the blacks ran, they endorsed some of the blacks, but they also endorsed the whites and the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.234" offset="3489290">So I urge upon you that the intent that is important is the intent of these appellants that they have done absolutely nothing that can be called on this record invidious discrimination.No black has ever lost an election in Mobile because of polarized voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.981" offset="3584272">And if you're going to draw inferences, why do you have to stop -- they -- they point to Montgomery, they point to Birmingham where tomorrow we may learn something because the men who got more votes than I think all three candidates, white candidates, for mayor is up for the final vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.231" offset="3677372">I think he got 30-something-thousand and the other three got 30-something-thousand.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.832" offset="3695762">But, look at Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.890" offset="3703912">Look at New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.150" offset="3709032">Look at Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.530" offset="3714466">Look at Newark.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.006" offset="3720422">And my prime example of all and -- because I'm leaving to go out there tomorrow, is Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.339" offset="3749784">Look at Bradley.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.537" offset="3754590">Bradley ran when only 17% of the people of Los Angeles were black.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.012" offset="3780399">He was defeated the first time around but he pulled himself up and ran again and he's been elected over and over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.847" offset="3815821">But yet in here, they talk about discouragement as being the reason that no qualified black has ran in Mobile even though they have equal opportunity, equal access, equal everything, and all they need is a qualified candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.379" offset="3893875">Now, it's true that on the record there was some dispute about whether qualified blacks could win.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.511" offset="3922401">The interesting thing to me was is the judge was working over Mr. Langan, who had won for 16 years straight and then the blacks turned against him so he lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.131" offset="3964928">He was trying to get him to say that no black could be elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.648" offset="3979034">And he said, "Well, it depends on the person."</text>
            <text syncTime="971.542" offset="3990528">And I think that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.174" offset="3997111">I think that the color of a man, the color of a woman, doesn't count in politics any more, it's their qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.504" offset="4038384">And this commission form of government, above all emphasizes, as Dan Alexander said, the business capacity of those who want to be commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.055" offset="4092615">Another aspect of this is, there are enormous differences between a city and a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.574" offset="4126678">I don't think that your decisions that relate to state governments really apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.973" offset="4152278">If you wipe out a multi-member state district, it doesn't change overall the state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.562" offset="4186655">If you wipe out the commission form of government in Mobile, you disestablish the whole government and bring in a whole -- whole new government, a mayor and nine councilmen and the councilmen meet once a week and get $50 for a meeting, they can only talk to the mayor, they're not allowed to talk to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.598" offset="4270770">And so the blacks really are diluted by that order because now they can go down and see any one of the commissioners and get anything they want, talk to the head man, because they see them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.091" offset="4328761">And under the Court's order they have to go down and see the mayor and wait in line, and they don't have the clout under the order that they have now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.957" offset="4372229">So --</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.816" offset="5891615">There are really only two issues that this Court must address in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.518" offset="5910424">The first is whether the case should be decided on the basis of the statute, the Voting Rights Act, or whether it should be decided on the basis of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.740" offset="5951384">And the second issue is whether this Court will affirm and leave undisturbed the findings of two courts below that the at-large election system in Mobile, Alabama is maintained for invidiously discriminatory reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.921" offset="6016063">We believe that particularly in light of the decisions of this Court in the last term, Cannon versus University of Chicago in particular, that the conclusion that there is a private cause of action under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.331" offset="6089728">Under the facts of Cort versus Ash, there is virtually no difference between the application of that case to Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and Title 9 of the Education Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.308" offset="6149601">That has been briefed and I will not go to -- into it in further detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.787" offset="6171544">With respect to the findings of fact that there is an invidious purpose in the maintenance of this election system, we believe, as we have said in the supplemental brief, that Columbus and Dayton and indeed, Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts against Feeney, virtually require this Court, following the same principles, to affirm the findings of the District Court and the Court of Appeals that the at-large election system first put into effect in 1911 has not been changed, notwithstanding attempts to do so, because of, not in spite of but because of, the knowledge that the at-large system prevents blacks from having their electoral choices registered in the election process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3253.540" offset="13118548">Here, the blacks have formed a political group, the Non-partisan Voters League and repeatedly have attempted to form coalitions with like-minded white voters but has been repeatedly unsuccessful.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.969" offset="13508295">And the Court said, “That's tough because you've made political choices and you had a fair chance.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3925.014" offset="15804458">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.767" offset="15815429">This case concerns the legality of the way the commissioners, the school commissioners of Mobile County are elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.292" offset="15849597">Mobile County encompasses the City of Mobile and a rather large surrounding area which includes some other smaller cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.826" offset="15895677">Overall, the population of the county is divided racially in about the same proportions as the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.779" offset="15931517">Blacks make up 32% of the county's population and I think 24% of its voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.565" offset="15966626">Mobile County's school system was the first to be established in Alabama in 1826, seven years after statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.793" offset="16007586">Since that time probably, and at least since 1836, when a new statute governing the school system was enacted, the members of the governing body of the school system have been elected from the county at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.998" offset="16080415">The current statute under which they have been elected, it was enacted in 1919, provides for the at-large election of five commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.517" offset="16126495">They are elected in partisan elections held in even numbered years for six-year staggered terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.423" offset="16158051">As a board, the commissioners are responsible for the overall direction and management of the Mobile County schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.132" offset="16196921">They hire a superintendent who is responsible under their direction for the day-to-day management.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.121" offset="16224925">Now, certain salient points appear from the findings below and the -- or the undisputed evidence of record concerning the school board's elections and their relation to the black population of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.175" offset="16297127">First, the system of at-large elections for Mobile County school board members was not created for any racially discriminatory reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.555" offset="16350626">As I have already indicated the system has deep roots in the history of Alabama and of Mobile in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.419" offset="16386048">It was first established in 1836, no later, at a time when blacks did not vote and the last reestablished in 1919 at a time when blacks were still effectively disfranchised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.872" offset="16451877">Second, the second salient point notwithstanding the history of racial discrimination in Alabama and Mobile, there are today no barriers, no barriers formal or informal to black participation in Mobile County's political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.728" offset="16539335">Blacks are free to register and vote and they do vote nearly in proportion to their proportion of the voting age population.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.723" offset="16579250">Their votes are sought for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.198" offset="16589176">The only significant candidate endorsing body that appears to operate county-wide in Mobile County is what you have heard about, that's the Non-partisan Voters League.</text>

            <text syncTime="4652.766" offset="18715439">It is a statement of whatever is said there.</text>

            <text syncTime="4680.421" offset="18826094">But I will go on and say that we can suppose -- we can suppose that this passage really did mean to conclude far more than it -- than it seems to have on its -- on -- on its face, that the at-large elections involves a present purpose to discriminate through state inaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.288" offset="18905506">Now -- now the -- the further question is what record facts are there that might support such a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.358" offset="18933823">The Court mentioned one specific fact on the preceding page and there it said -- and these are its words approximately, whenever a redistricting bill of any type is proposed by a member of the Mobile County legislative delegation, a major concern is centered around how many if any blacks would be elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.033" offset="19036536">He does say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.481" offset="19042283">Now, the fact is that in spite of that concern -- in spite of that concern, or perhaps even because of it, the legislature in 1975 did enact districting legislation for the Mobile County school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.106" offset="19096827">That legislation was voided on the suit of the school board because of a defect in notice that rendered it invalid under the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.598" offset="19138832">Now, the -- the plaintiffs met to seek to make a great deal of this invalidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.200" offset="19161192">I think what they would have this Court rule is that the districting legislation and its invalidation somehow constitute evidence of a present purpose to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.846" offset="19211766">The least that can be said in response to that, Your Honors, is that the District Court did not so treat it and made no such finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.828" offset="19247710">And I would suggest further that the federal judicial inquiry that might even yield such a finding would be an undertaking of extreme delicacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.834" offset="19291700">I submit that this Court should not be asked to make the sort of judgment on the Alabama legislature that appellees state or imply on the basis of nothing more than what appears in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.667" offset="19351050">So when the specifics are out of the way that the District Court cited and if we forget the 1975 enactment that on its face looks the other way, what we have at the very most, at the very most is state legislative inaction that maintains a non-racially motivated at-large voting system and an awareness on the part of at least some legislators of the disparate racial effects of that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.712" offset="19487201">Now, I submit that to make a finding or to draw a conclusion of a present purpose to discriminate on the basis of this perpetuation arguably of discriminatory effects through inaction is exactly -- is exactly what this Court rejected last term in Personnel Administrator against Feeney, and indeed in the Feeney case there was more than mere inaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.859" offset="19619798">The Massachusetts Veterans Preference law had been amended from time to time and effectively reenacted, and the Court did not blink at saying that there must have been full awareness on the part of the general court that the legislation -- that the legislation was keeping a disproportionate number of women out of the higher levels of the civil service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.000" offset="19704435">But that wasn't enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.921" offset="19712063">That wasn't enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.614" offset="19718855">To have made it enough would have undermined the rule of constitutional law with which the Court began its analysis in Feeney.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.139" offset="19756993">And that rule stated, even in the paradigm case of race, that is what the Court said, even if a neutral law has a disproportionately adverse effect, it is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause only if that impact can be traced to a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.910" offset="19835988">Now, let me stop there for a moment and just say a word about the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.837" offset="19855736">The Court of Appeals held in the companion cases, one doesn't know what the Court meant to hold in our case because its -- its opinion is not at all revealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4949.578" offset="19902757">But in the companion cases, the Court of Appeals held that the Fifteenth Amendment imposes the same purpose requirement, and we have urged in our briefs -- I will not -- I will not expand upon the points now but I think they're adequately made there that the Court of Appeals was quite right that -- that one does not escape the problem that is posed under the Fourteenth Amendment in this case by turning to the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="5416.997" offset="21772392">Before turning to the substantive issues presented by the case, I think it might be useful to lay out some of the procedural problems about the way the Court will choose to address the variety of issues presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.051" offset="21824637">Some of them have come up before, some of them have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.903" offset="21839997">One issue which Mr. Allen raised and which has been raised by earlier questions is -- is whether or not to deal with the statutory question that is I think unquestionably presented by the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5445.932" offset="21888167">The Court has for many years maintained a policy which it has attempted to persuade the lower courts to follow of deciding statutory issues first and only reaching constitutional issues if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.498" offset="21942397">As this case and Beazer and Bakke all illustrate the lower courts have not been assiduous in attending to that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.558" offset="21978655">And the -- the question before the Court is -- is how the Court is to act when the lower court has not followed your preferred procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.841" offset="22011779">I think that there are three options, one of which should not be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.305" offset="22029646">The one that should not be taken is the -- is the option taken in Arlington Heights, which is to decide the constitutional question and remand for decision on the statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.313" offset="22065695">As you may remember, after ruling for the defendants on the constitutional question in that case that an opinion which provoked some dissents and made a lot of law that may or may not -- had not been necessary, on remand the District Court of Appeals reached the statutory issue ruled for the plaintiff and this Court denied search.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.402" offset="22138002">So that an entire opinion with all its ramifications and we deal with many of them today was unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.185" offset="22165170">I think that -- that following that course would be unwise not only because it leads you into deciding unnecessary issues but because it doesn't -- I would lead the Courts of Appeals by example and that was not the kind of example I think you wanted to give them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.262" offset="22217415">And I think the two options you have are, first, and I think this is probably the proper option to do what you did in Bakke, to decide the statutory issue first, reach the constitutional issue if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5539.280" offset="22261509">Or you could wipe the whole case out and send it back and tell the Court of Appeals to do it right the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="6065.747" offset="24367397">And we think the Court should not entertain a general practice of -- of reopening recent constitutional decisions and -- and this one we suggest was in an -- in any event quite properly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="6078.894" offset="24419955">We also note that the argument against for overturning White is really two legs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6084.284" offset="24441584">One of them is that Washington against Davis has -- has somehow rather changed the underlying law in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6092.300" offset="24473558">We've suggested in our briefs that Washington against Davis and -- and White against Regester deal with two different branches of equal protection law that Washington against Davis is concerned with the branch of equal protection law forbidding racial classifications whereas White against Regester is part of the Reynolds against Sims branch of equal protection law concerning special protections for particularly important and fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.389" offset="24585989">The other basis of the attack on White, and one which I think has been recurrent in the questions before the Court today, is whether White makes any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6131.041" offset="24628517">And -- and I think our arguments about wouldn't all this go away if blacks lived everywhere and can't blacks be elected in Los Angeles and the like, and all of which I think on the merits are -- are unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.226" offset="24681284">In the final analysis, there are arguments that White against Regester was wrongly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.617" offset="24698838">And -- and we think that the Court ought not be entertaining that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6152.246" offset="24713362">I think we -- you should start with White against Regester, enforce it and we think it would be dispositive to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6159.777" offset="24743455">I'd like to turn to -- on other issues that arose earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6164.645" offset="24762995">When we were here in the spring, Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked whether in -- well, he raised the following question, we were discussing apparently inconsistent statements about the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.327" offset="24813672">Attorney General Katzenbach was quoted by our side as -- as stating that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act encompassed the purpose or effect standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.866" offset="24855886">Mr. Justice Rehnquist noted that Senator Dirksen had made a remark about Section 2 almost meaning the same thing as -- as the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6200.536" offset="24906564">And I'd like to return to that subject because I think it's important particularly in view of my position that the statutory issue ought to be decided first.</text>
            <text syncTime="6207.771" offset="24935508">If you will revert to the Dirksen quote, you'll notice that it doesn't happen on the floor of the Senate, it happens during a hearing, indeed the very hearing, almost at the very hour when Katzenbach testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.264" offset="24989424">Dirksen was one of the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and was according to the transcript, in the room at the beginning of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6228.585" offset="25018786">Dirksen sat there while Katzenbach said Section 2 means purpose or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6232.775" offset="25035504">A few pages later, Senator Dirksen says the Fifteenth Amend -- Section 2 means almost the same thing as the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.032" offset="25064552">Now, either those people just -- one has to try to reconcile those statements and of course one could reconcile them by accepting our view of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6249.503" offset="25102378">But I think that -- that the government's footnote and Justice Stevens' opinion in Bakke suggest a more sensible resolution of it which is to say that those two statements were regarded by their spokesmen as -- as consistent with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="6264.421" offset="25162041">Because Congress at that point in time regarded Section 2 in -- as incorporating the purpose or effect standard which they thought was in the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6275.813" offset="25207599">And there's a passage in -- Justice Stevens, in your opinion in Bakke which describes Title VI in the same kind of way, but -- but suggests that Title VI has independent force and it doesn't merely incorporate whatever the Fourteenth Amendment should be held to mean by this Court, without wanting to get it -- reopen the particular issues that were involved in Bakke.</text>
            <text syncTime="6296.684" offset="25291086">I think that method of analysis, however persuasive, run persuasive in Bakke is the correct method of analysis here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.701" offset="25319194">The second thing that -- that comes out when you reread that passage is the context in which it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.198" offset="25341137">As you will doubtless recall, one of the primary arguments that was made against the Voting Rights Act was that it was regional in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.927" offset="25368095">That it only -- that it singled out a group of southern states for treatment different than the treatment of -- that was being afforded to the rest of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6325.210" offset="25405189">Senator Dirksen, in -- in making that remark about Section 2, makes it -- in the context of a paragraph in which he says look at Section 2, Section 2 covers Texas, as you recall, Texas was the big bone of contention because the President was from Texas and it wasn't (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="6341.917" offset="25472063">Section 2 covers Texas, so that -- so Texas is covered by the Voting Rights Act, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.748" offset="25491393">Now, if -- if Section 2 is merely the Fifteenth Amendment in a purposes standard, then that statement makes no sense at all But, if it --</text>

            <text syncTime="6426.875" offset="25811864">And as we've noted in our brief, the history of the Voting Rights Act reflects great sensitivity on the part of the Court to the possibility of a regional rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="6740.407" offset="27066055">I think I only have one point and -- and that is that I hope it is not we who are being accused of -- of thinking that White against Regester represents something less than good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6757.634" offset="27134913">The -- the fact is that the opening of the analysis in White against Regester begins this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6768.863" offset="27179844">We have entertained claims that multi-member districts are being used invidiously to cancel out or minimize the voting strengths of racial groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="6777.772" offset="27215475">To sustain such proof, it is not enough that the racial group has not had legislative seats in proportion to its voting potential.</text>
            <text syncTime="6787.608" offset="27254868">The plaintiffs' burden, paraphrasing now, is to produce evidence that would support findings that the political processes leading to nomination and election are not equally open to participation by the groups in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.607" offset="27314845">And that we submit is what was lacking from the proofs offered in the -- in the county or the -- the school district's case here.</text>
