            <text syncTime="28.937" offset="219094">The issue in this case is whether the respondent was properly convicted for willfully failing to pay a tax imposed by the Revenue Code of 1954 on coin-operated gaming devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.683" offset="302059">And this, in turn, is dependent on whether three particular machines which the respondent maintained on his premises fall within the depth -- to the description of slot machines as that term is used in the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.986" offset="383352">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the conviction of Korpan on the ground that his machines were pinball machines, not slot machines, and were not subject to the $250 tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.255" offset="456391">Now the facts in this case are these, the respondent maintained a summer resort known as Korpan's Landing on Fox Lake in Northern Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.117" offset="515845">And then a tavern which he had there, he had certain coin-operated machine games of various kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.844" offset="554715">The three, which are involved in this case, were games which were activated by inserting a dime in a slot, and this gave the player the opportunity of propelling five steel balls onto an inclined plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.453" offset="629217">They would run back down the -- the slant of the -- of the table and fall into certain holes where they would make electrical contacts and numbers would appear on the panel at the end of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.571" offset="677700">The object of the game was to strike numbers which would make a line of three, or four, or five straight across vertically or diagonally.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.190" offset="3088175">He said these are pinball machines and Congress certainly didn't intend to have -- to tax pinball machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.514" offset="3117432">The language of the statute, and this is as the Court concedes, it's purely a question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.749" offset="3138330">It's -- it's quoted on pages 2 and 3 of the Government brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.756" offset="3166438">There's a tax, as I say, a -- $10 a year on any amusement or music machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.046" offset="3199561">And then there is a tax of $250, and now I read from the bottom of page 2, on so-called "slot machines" which operate by means of insertion of a coin, token or similar object, and which by application of the element of chance may deliver or entitle the person playing or operating the machine to receive cash, premiums, merchandised as token.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.571" offset="3317635">Now, on the language of the statute, this is a machine which is activated by the insertion of a coin, there's no question about it, whether or not -- and -- and the element of chance is -- is taken cared of both by the nature of the machine, the findings of -- of the District Court which was not upset by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.663" offset="3410004">And there is no question that the operators were given the right to receive cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.544" offset="3437589">But the court below said that all of these conditions applied only when you started out with a so-called "slot machine."</text>
            <text syncTime="844.547" offset="3481579">And the court below said, "This isn't what I consider to be a slot machine."</text>
            <text syncTime="851.643" offset="3509896">Now, if he had taken the ordinary definition, dictionary definition of slot machine, which he quotes in his -- in his opinion, there's no question that it is a slot machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.997" offset="3555349">Webster's Dictionary defines a slot machine, as a machine, the operation of which it started by dropping a coin in a slot unless the Court recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.191" offset="3592129">But they said, when Congress added the words so-called and put the words slot machine in quotation marks, they intended something other than the ordinary dictionary definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.292" offset="3660570">Well, I think that what they meant -- what Congress must have intended by that -- that form was that they didn't –- they thought they were using a term which wasn't an elegant usage, maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.049" offset="3711561">It was a -- it was a common term.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.273" offset="3720443">They wanted to give it a -- a broad scope rather than they use any -- considered as a technical definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.695" offset="3750118">Now, actually, at the time the statute was passed, coin machines that are used for gaming were generally called in statutes, and by the courts, and the Digest, they were called slot machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.656" offset="3809991">If one looks at the gambling laws of New Jersey or -- or New York or -- or California, Oklahoma and any number of States, you find in -- in the head notes or in the definition of gambling machines that they use the term "slot machine" as a -- as a definition of -- of coin activated gambling devices and then they go on and define the term very broadly to include all sorts of -- of coin activated devices with which one gambles.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.909" offset="3930990">So it seems to me that when -- when Congress used the term so-called "slot machines", it was merely using the term to mean these things which are called and these certainly were called slot machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.287" offset="3992534">But the court below said that the legislative history showed an intention to -- to limit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.187" offset="4024090">Legislative history is this, the statute originated being a revenue measure, of course, originated in the House of Representatives in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.900" offset="4062960">And at the -- at the time that the tax was imposed, there was no distinction drawn between different types of coin activated games, gambling games and amusement -- just amusement games were supposed to tax $25.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.408" offset="4113011">When it got into the Senate, Senator Clark felt that there should be a distinction drawn between gambling games and amusement games.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.488" offset="4153344">And he proposed the amendment which results in the differentiation of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.400" offset="4176959">And at page 28 of my brief, I quote when he told the Senate as to why he did this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.038" offset="4203499">Down at the bottom of the page for example he said, "Mr. President it seem to me and to a majority of the members of the Finance Committee that it was a disgrace to put all slot machines in the same class, therefore, we reduced the tax on the innocent slot machines, the ones which do not involve any gambling in -- from $25 to $10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.346" offset="4288763">And then he goes into a discussion which is on the next two pages with Senator Barkley in which Senator Barkley said, "Well, the difference you were trying to determine, the difference on which you are pacing the tax is whether or not, they're gambling, whether they can get anything back rather than a pleasure of -- of fame.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.876" offset="4354905">And Senator Clark said that was the purpose of this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.112" offset="4367862">And that is the background of this change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.121" offset="4375907">That's why the change was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.579" offset="4381654">They hit the gambling machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.357" offset="4392835">Well in 1942, a year later, there was a feeling that this tax, which at that time was $50 or higher of the two tax, this tax was too high to impose on gambling machines that you put a penny in and you get a ball of gum and you also get a price which is worth not more than 5 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.608" offset="4473814">And so, the industry came in and they said “You put us out of business if you put this kind of a tax on it."</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.762" offset="4498369">And so Congress drew an exception which is in the statute today saying if you got a penny from machine of that kind that it shall not be subject to the larger tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.089" offset="4539747">Now, if Congress had intended only one-armed bandits to be subject for the larger tax, there would have been no occasion or whatsoever for this exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.509" offset="4577364">I mean, it's perfectly clear that no one would ever consider one of these one cent vending machines to be a one-armed bandit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.689" offset="4610173">They have no -- there's no connection between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.934" offset="4623130">So these two is an -- an example of what Congress originally intended and -- and when it passed the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.120" offset="4659806">As a matter of fact, the Internal Revenue Service has had a regulation on its book since 1942 saying that the tax shall be imposed in the larger amount where three games are redeemed in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.180" offset="4724067">It's been made -- that too, the -- the regulation too is cited in our brief at page 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.474" offset="4745279">But that's been on the books since 1942 and it's been objected too by the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.543" offset="4789582">There have been congressional hearings that this is too strict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.788" offset="4802539">Congress has reenacted the statute without making any change in the -- in the definition of slot machines knowing that this regulation was on the books and was being enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.438" offset="4849142">The respondent and the court below purport to find that there has been no consistent in -- in administrative interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.401" offset="4893027">There was one inconsistent interpretation given by a local collector of Internal Revenue, a single inconsistent interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.557" offset="4937644">The only one way we've been able to discover and I think that it was a mistake and doesn't stand in -- in the -- in the way of our position that this statute has received from the beginning, an interpretation consistent with that which we present to you now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.444" offset="5021132">And actually, I suppose the strongest argument for the interpretation we imposes that it makes common sense, it's just -- it's just as what Senator Clark meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.953" offset="5063137">It's -- but what anyone, it doesn't really make any difference what the nature of the machine is whether it's called by a lever or plunges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.013" offset="5099395">If it is a gambling device, which they pay off money on, it seems to us obvious that's what Congress intended to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.569" offset="5129697">So here we are fortunate in having support both from the language of the statute itself, from the legislative history and, as I say, from just ordinary plain common sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.442" offset="5221125">Mr. Chief Justice and Your Honors, looking at the language of the statute first, Section 4462 (a) (2) speaks of the so-called "slot machines" which are taxed at the rate of $250.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.318" offset="5312658">Now, this can mean only one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.858" offset="5326764">It can either be a machine with any type of coin slot or it must mean a one-armed bandit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.498" offset="5361351">It cannot -- there's no third meaning, those are the only two possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.725" offset="5382248">Now, if it means a machine that merely has the coin slot, then the words which followed it immediately which state -- which operate by means of the insertion of a coin, token, or similar object would be entirely redundant and unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.156" offset="5459989">So that -- we believe that the Court of Appeals was entirely correct in holding that the meaning to be applied to this language, these words is the meaning -- the second meaning of a one-armed bandit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.847" offset="5526758">The government counsel speaks of common sense in approaching this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.355" offset="5552776">I think that we could all have enough judicial knowledge of these types of games to know that there are pinball games and there are slot machines and they are two different devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.529" offset="5613484">The -- I think actually, the Government is contending that there are -- there's -- there is some kind of a third meaning which relates to the use of the machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.084" offset="5663744">In other words, the machine can be a slot machine that was used in one way.</text>
