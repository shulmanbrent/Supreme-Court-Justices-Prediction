            <label>Mr. William J. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="8.429" offset="137070">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.345" offset="160789">In considering the application of Hill against Florida to the present case, it should be noted that the issue there was one of the supremacy of federal law under the Commerce Clause with a conflicting state law rather than strictly one of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.996" offset="255352">Here, we have the same issue of the supremacy of federal law over state law but it is reenforced in this case by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.136" offset="315956">I think what I say can be made clear by referring to two other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.596" offset="333720">I think the closest case to our present one on its facts is Johnson against Maryland in 254 United States 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.014" offset="371440">There, the specific question was whether or not the Post Office Department was limited in hiring drivers to deliver mail in Maryland to individuals who had been licensed by the State of Maryland to drive motor vehicles in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.887" offset="462869">And Mr. Justice Holmes speaking for the Court found that the Post Office Department should not be limited in its choice of drivers of its mail trucks to those who had been licensed by the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.750" offset="538415">Now on the other hand the -- the case which really gives us the -- the greatest difficulty is the Penn Dairies case.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.662" offset="581987">There, the question was the application of the Pennsylvania law which imposed a minimum price on the sale of milk in Pennsylvania, the application of this law, the transactions between a Pennsylvania dairy and the United States which was buying milk for use in -- in army camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.045" offset="675506">The Court held that the minimum price requirement of the State of Pennsylvania was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.440" offset="701106">It did so by treating this case in the same light as it would have treated a case of a non-discriminatory tax which is imposed upon an agency of the United States and where there is quite a line of cases now holding that as long as the -- as the tax is non-discriminatory, it may be imposed even though there is an additional economic burden on the United States by reason of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.489" offset="825344">Reasoning from this basis the Court said, that this did not interfere in effect, it didn't really interfere with the United States procurement of milk.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.862" offset="874872">It added an economic burden to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.353" offset="884799">It made -- it may have caused the United States more to buy its milk but it didn't really interfere, it wasn't inconsistent with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.171" offset="916041">And that the additional economic burden was well merely one of those burdens which is the price of paying that we have to pay by having a dual sovereignty.</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="216.535" offset="969540">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.032" offset="971525">That was one of the tax cases itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.806" offset="978631">That was a tax case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="220.228" offset="984273">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_smith" startTime="221.392" stopTime="571.534">
            <label>Mr. William J. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="221.392" offset="988975">Now, in this -- in the Penn Dairies case, there is -- there is another distinction between this and the Penn Dairies case.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.348" offset="1020740">In that case, it was specifically recognized that if Congress had desired to remove this activity from the field of state regulation, Congress would have had the power to have said so and that if it had its law would have been supreme that it would have removed it from -- from the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.328" offset="1120632">Now, that's important in this case because it comes down to the second leg of our argument namely, that here, Congress, through the Armed Services Procurement Act and the regulations which have been adopted pursuant to it, Congress has legislated with respect to this type of procurement in a way which excludes the State from regulating it at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.722" offset="1246229">I -- I don't mean by this that Congress has said, "The State shall not regulate procurement."</text>
            <text syncTime="291.701" offset="1270157">I don't think that Penn Dairies means that there should be a -- a necessarily an outright statement to that but what -- what appears here is that the legislation which has been enacted by Congress is so inclusive, so pervasive that it would be inconsistent to believe that Congress could believe that the States could regulate it at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.293" offset="1388544">The Armed Services Procurement Act or pertinent portions of it are set forth in -- in our brief beginning in -- in the appendix, beginning at page 46.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.824" offset="1434624">And that with respect to this type of -- with respect to this type of contract, which is a contract which is placed by advertising, it is provided and I'm reading from page 49 of our brief, Section 3 (b), "All bids shall be publicly opened at the time and place stated in the advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.674" offset="1542040">Awards shall be made with reasonable promptness by written notice to that responsible bidder whose bid conforming to the invitations of bids shall be found most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.”</text>
            <text syncTime="380.973" offset="1627303">This vest in the contracting officers in this case the Corps of Engineers, the discretion to determine which bid is most advantageous to the Government and they in turn are guided by the regulations which are set forth in the pages which follow as to what consideration shall be given -- shall be taken into consideration in determining which is the most advantageous bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.601" offset="1745795">The Act itself gives -- gives some guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.114" offset="1755826">For example in the first -- in Section 2 of the Act, there's a provision that in entering into such contracts, consideration shall be given to protecting small business.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.316" offset="1816639">This then would be one of the considerations which would have to be considered in determining which bid should be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.071" offset="1847672">Now in order to make concrete for this Court to be -- the type of -- the way these two laws would conflict, I think it be interesting to -- to note the application in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.349" offset="1904724">In this case, bids were invited from 126 firms and bids were received from 16 bidders and Mr. Justice Brennan, there was only one of those that was located in -- in Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.401" offset="2004929">Of the 16 bidders, seven only were licensed by Arkansas and nine were non-licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.139" offset="2051950">The engineers in going over the bids determined that Leslie Miller was the best, most advantageous, responsible bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.585" offset="2089671">It was not licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.366" offset="2096880">If -- if the Corps of the Engineers had been governed by the Arkansas statute, it would have been necessary to sift through these 16 bidders and to -- to take first the one that was most advantageous, Leslie Miller wasn't licensed and go down through the list until it found one that was licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.568" offset="2189667">Now obviously, this is substituting for the discretion of the -- of the Corp of Engineers as governed by the law and the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.311" offset="2228642">It's -- it's substituting a judgment of the State of Arkansas as to who should be licensed and who is licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.047" offset="2255600">And that I believe is a direct conflict which -- which shows that the two laws cannot in -- in effect live together and that in that case the federal law should be given the supremacy which is required by Article 6 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.746" offset="2354343">I would like, if I may, to -- and go on amicus curiae, I would like, if I may, to reserve time for -- for rebuttal if this would be agreeable to Mr. Davis.</text>

            <text syncTime="808.935" offset="3339160">I don't recall what the issue in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.617" offset="3365804">I think the issue is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.251" offset="3372387">I think the issue can be taken from Penn Dairies as cited by or as stated by this Court in its opinion in Penn Dairies.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.095" offset="3411780">There he said since the Constitution had left Congress free to set aside local taxation and regulation of Government contractors which burdened the national government, we see no basis for implying from the constitutional alone a restriction of all certain regulations which Congress has not seen fit to impose unless the regulations are shown to be inconsistent with congressional policy citing cases and continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.201" offset="3548139">Our inquiry here therefore must be whether the state regulation of this contract in a matter of local concern, conflicts with congressional legislation or with any desirable congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.476" offset="3609266">I agree 100% that that's the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.812" offset="3626611">We think that Congress has created a framework of legislation for the letting of these contracts, these construction contracts and other types of contracts but -- but particularly a construction contract within the framework of these state regulatory laws and the reason I say these state because approximately one half of the states have a similar law.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.215" offset="3748237">Now, before proceeding further with the -- with the issues on the law, I would like to give some background in view of the argument yesterday as to the purpose of this law or certainly to say that these laws have only for their purpose the protection of the owner who deals with the contractor as a fallacious argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.903" offset="3855026">These laws seek to protect the -- the state assets, the people assets, the welfare and the health of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.961" offset="3891179">The construction industry is one of the most important segments of the industry of any state or the economy of any state and to stabilize the construction and receive one of the purposes of this law and now the states have followed the same procedure in enacting similar laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.587" offset="3957739">This law has been on the statute books in Arkansas since 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.420" offset="3973099">There's never been one case cited to you or one instance where this board has tried to be arbitrary or tried to keep outsiders out of the State of Arkansas or tried to use it for any improper motive elements and to accomplish the purposes of the law and that's to stabilize the construction industry within the borders of Arkansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.239" offset="4376325">It should be my purpose to show that there's no conflict for instance there has no standard form of contract adopted for construction contracts cited in our brief at page 10, United States standard form contract on Title 41 in the appendix, 41, Section 54413 provided in part, Article 10, "Permits and responsibility for work, the contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government obtain all required licenses and permits."</text>
