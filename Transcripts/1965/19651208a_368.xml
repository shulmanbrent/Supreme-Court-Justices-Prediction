            <label>Mr. William I. Cowin</label>
            <text syncTime="44.938" offset="284170">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.671" offset="299112">This has been oblique eight-and-a-half years of Government Attorneys appearing before this Court in obscenity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.416" offset="330041">Since the time in June of 1957 when a majority of this Court rejected the contention that the First Amendment might be absolute and said that implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.969" offset="404229">The Government Attorneys have appeared here time, and again, and have lost, and have lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.724" offset="427321">And yet, during this period, the Court has yet to say that any form of expression is exempt from this determination that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.191" offset="485209">Magazines presumably are included, as well as photographs, hardcover books would be included as well as a film, a novel would be included such as what we're dealing with here today as well as an anthology.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.915" offset="540066">This is still a position despite pressures upon the Court to adopt an all-inclusive absolute view of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.430" offset="570159">In 1964, in the Jacobellis case, this Court said we would reiterate our recognition in Roth that obscenity is excluded from the constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.161" offset="617075">In accordance with this determination, the Court has developed certain standards to determine exactly what is to be considered obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.074" offset="660647">I would gather that this effort indicates that the Court intends these standards to be applied and that there will be certain materials, novels included, since the Court has never specifically exempted them which will meet the standards and accordingly be declared obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.031" offset="732536">Yet, in the intervening eight-and-a-half years since the Roth test, the Court has affirmed efforts in the parts of states and of lower federal courts to regulate in only three cases on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.478" offset="790319">The day upon which Roth and Alberts were decided and on the same day the case, Kingsley Books versus Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.375" offset="821875">Even in these cases, the Court did not primarily go to the nature of the materials themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.234" offset="845281">In Roth and Alberts, the presumed obscenity of the materials was conceded, the Court considered only the question as to whether or not obscenity legislation could be constitutional and in the Kingsley Books versus Brown case, the Court was primarily concerned with the question as to whether a civil injunctive procedure against the book would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.147" offset="940993">In all other cases, either the application of the test themselves or certain procedural questions have defeated the attempts of the state or of the particular federal statute which was involved to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.984" offset="1004314">The question is raised accordingly, especially with the form of expression with which we are dealing today, a novel without accompanying illustrations or presumably without accompanying actions stemming from it, whether or not this test can ever be applicable to this form of literature or whether perhaps this is a form of writing which goes beyond to which the test cannot be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.846" offset="1103788">This is the position I believe that the appellant would have us take.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.642" offset="1123015">Granted, the application of test to any kind of expression is an extremely sensitive complex business between the limitations -- between the delimitations upon this area that are created on the one hand by an absolute view of the First Amendment and on the other hand by the pre-Roth more liberal permissive reaction of this Court toward state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.340" offset="1233774">This is an extremely complex area.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.814" offset="1243700">I would not suggest for a minute that this was a question that the Court could determine easily or for that matter determine without a careful examination of the book that is before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.423" offset="1294064">On the other hand, the appellant takes a view of the test which I submit is a distorted view.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.694" offset="1327188">His view makes it absolutely impossible ever to apply the test to a particular piece of writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.733" offset="1359370">In his view, there can never really be a piece of writing that does not have some of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.919" offset="1388105">There can never really be a piece of writing that really appeals to prurient interest of the average person.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.675" offset="1415064">And in his view, I am forced to gather that the average person simply is not offended by anything anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.545" offset="1450590">I do not believe that this is position -- is a position that the Court has either adopted already or is going to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.186" offset="1481101">Rather, I think that the three tests that the Court has developed are tests which can be appropriately and reasonably applied to materials such as the one, such as the material that is before the Court and that in this particular case, such a reasonable application will result in a determination that this book is obscene and can constitutionally be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.387" offset="1577963">The book is in the record and it is certainly unnecessary to refer to it at length.The nature of it is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.120" offset="1604921">When the book was before the New York Court of Appeals in the Larkin case, Mr. Chief Justice Desmond, who was the dissenting judge in that case, referred to the book as follows, the book is “pornography” in the strictest etymological sense of the word since it is quite literally, “the narration by a prostitute of the particulars of their trade”.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.248" offset="1697395">It takes ten pages for Cleland to get Fanny from the outskirts of England into the center of London and it has been commented that some of Cleland's contemporaries, to whom the appellant is referred, take almost as many volumes to move their characters from place to place, although, I realize the counting pages in a book is not a test in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.678" offset="1779106">It perhaps can be indicative of the subject matter which is being treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.287" offset="1801571">Of the remaining 204 pages in this book, there are sexual scenes and descriptions and references on all the 32 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.198" offset="1837202">These 32 pages are transitional in nature but even in these much relates discusses or describes or refers to the scenes that are either have gone before or there about to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.528" offset="1886521">A catalog of acts, that would be unnecessary and I think inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.141" offset="1904912">The -- I would simply mention that unlike a book such as the “Tropic of Cancer” where their reader was forced to do quite a bit of searching for what he might have felt with more interesting scenes, this is a book that is ideal for the schema, absolutely, no searching is necessary at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.731" offset="1967292">The book can be opened any point and the so-called prurient reader will find what he is looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.909" offset="2004072">The heroine herself comments at the outset of the second letter of the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.288" offset="2021522">I imagined indeed that you would have been cloyed and tied with uniformity of adventures and expressions and I'm inclined to agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.134" offset="2056944">In the Roth case in 1957, the Court announced all ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance, unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion have the full protection of the guarantees unless excludible because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.312" offset="2149627">And this approach, the so-called social value of test has been reiterated again recently in the Jacobellis case of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.499" offset="2194348">The appellant takes the position that an easy way out for the Court is simply to examine the record to see whether or not there is expert testimony on the subject of social value or redeeming importance and if such testimony appears that this -- the Court must adopt it, must accept it and this in effect ends the case since it is found that the book has social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.592" offset="2294763">I'm afraid that it's impossible for me to agree with this, primary -- first of all, this is an approach which has not been adopted in the taking of any kind of expert testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.900" offset="2340007">Expert testimony is always taken subject to the ultimate determination of the trier of fact, be at a jury or a judge as in the present case, as to whether or not to believe the opinions of the experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.506" offset="2390371">But perhaps even more important and especially in an area such as this which is of such extreme constitutional sensitivity, we take -- we are getting a loaded case from the experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.153" offset="2441049">The example which immediately comes to my mind might come from an eminent domain proceeding where an appraiser who testifies as to the value of land may have some bias or predetermination that in all instances, he is going to make sure that the person whose land has been taken gets 50 times the value of the land.Certainly, this would be expert opinion which would be subject to doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.198" offset="2541150">I believe that the expert opinion that we have in obscenity cases is quite similar in light -- in the sense of having this bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.062" offset="2580647">I have no complaint as to the qualifications or the good will of the experts who appeared in the trial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.706" offset="2611263">One of them, in fact, Professor John Bullitt was a professor of mine when I was in college.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.694" offset="2635191">But these men come into court with a predetermination, a sophisticated understanding, that all it is necessary in light of current decisions of this Court to protect the piece of writing is the discovery of some value in it, and they are dedicated to the idea that they are going to discover this value.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.277" offset="2713454">Therefore, if --</text>
