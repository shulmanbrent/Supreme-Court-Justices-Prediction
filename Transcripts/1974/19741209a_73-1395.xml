            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="7.495" offset="133308">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.712" offset="146265">This case is here on the government's petition for writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, dismissing the government's appeal from the judgment of the District Court in this case which after a jury verdict of guilty, dismissed respondent's indictment because of allegedly prejudicial pre-indictment delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.280" offset="240515">Respondent was the Financial Secretary and the Business Manager of a union local in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.580" offset="261726">The indictment charged that he had converted approximately $1,200 in funds belonging to the union, for the purpose of paying the cost of his daughter's wedding reception in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.894" offset="306970">This payment was made by a check issued by two officers of the union, Brinker and Schaefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.722" offset="330271">Brinker died in 1968 before the investigation of respondent's activities by the FBI was very far along.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.100" offset="371754">By the time the indictment was returned in this case, in 1971, Schaefer was terminally ill and he was unavailable to testify at respondent's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.477" offset="425253">On the basis of the unavailability of Mr. Schaefer and Brinker, respondent twice moved before trial for dismissal of the charges against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.882" offset="462869">Hearings were held on both these motions and the evidence on behalf of the government at these hearings showed that Schaefer and Brinker had no active role in the union's business affairs, that their signatures on the union checks were a routine perfunctory matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.710" offset="522219">Respondent on the other hand testified that he had never directed anyone to prepare the check or to use union funds to pay for his daughter's wedding.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.530" offset="557537">After each hearing, the District Court denied respondent's motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.316" offset="576658">At trial, respondent moved for a judgment of acquittal, which was denied and the case was submitted to the jury which returned a guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.160" offset="611976">Respondent then renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, it was again denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.130" offset="631933">Thereafter, respondent filed further post trial motions again asking for acquittal and also for arrest of judgment on new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.211" offset="660250">Each motion was based in part on his contention regarding the pre-indictment delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.658" offset="681984">Three weeks after the filing of these motions, the District Court entered an order dismissing the indictment on the grounds of prejudicial pre-indictment delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.733" offset="714271">It did so without eluding to its previous actions denying the same motions prior to trial, but stating that it had taken notice of facts brought out in the testimony of the case concerning the potential testimony of Mr. Schaefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.420" offset="769024">Since we believe that the District Court had erred in its legal conclusion, that there was an unreasonable delay depriving respondent of his opportunity for a fair trial, and that this was in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, an appeal to the Third Circuit was authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.561" offset="837569">The Court of Appeals initially entered an order dismissing the appeal in citing Sisson and claiming that the appeal was not permissible under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.622" offset="877902">Consequently, we filed a petition for re-hearing and also in the event there was some statutory problem in their view, a petition for mandamus in the alternative relying on the Dooling case in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.603" offset="937775">Re-hearing was denied and this time the Court of Appeals issued an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.990" offset="955329">It agreed that there was no statutory impediment to appeal, leaving aside of course, the statutes in corporation of any constitutional restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.314" offset="988662">They concluded that the appeal was constitutionally barred because the action of the Trial Court was an acquittal and because acquittals could not in its view be appealed consistently with the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.739" offset="1034324">In concluding that the action of the District Court was an acquittal, the Court of Appeals relied on the definition of the term in Sission, where by the way, it was being defined for the purpose of determining a question of appealability under former Section 3731.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.996" offset="1095346">That definition is, “the trial judge's disposition is an acquittal, if it is a legal determination on the basis of facts adduced at trial relating to the general issue of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.151" offset="1143933">The Court of Appeal said that the determination made by the District Court here was based on the facts adduced at trial which we don't dispute and that these facts related to the general issue of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.503" offset="1205373">And that therefore, since it was based on facts adduced at trial which related to the general issue of the case, it was an acquittal, even though the determination itself had nothing to do with the general issue of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.115" offset="1259813">Now, the case poses two questions, one which we began discussing this morning in the Jenkins case, that is assuming that this is characterized as an acquittal properly by the Court of Appeals, does that bar our recourse to appellate review, and secondly the question of whether -- if that is the case, was it properly so characterized.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.158" offset="1363989">Now, I'd like to deal further with the first issue if I may, which we were discussing this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.418" offset="1401083">I think the Court has to look at this question which as I've indicated is a matter of first impression here.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.359" offset="1440789">And it has to consider of what it is that the government is asking to have done, and what the interests are of the system of public justice on the one hand, and the legitimate interest of the defendant that the Constitution recognizes and seeks to protect on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.059" offset="1515604">Now, we submit that there is no articulable value, there is no rational constitutional policy, that is dis-served by allowing government appeals in circumstances such as those presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.349" offset="1568789">If the government appeal fails, that is if we're wrong on the merits and the District Court was right, then the judgment is affirmed and the defendant is finally discharged and the matter is concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.872" offset="1622810">On the other hand if it succeeds, the trial court is simply required to attach to the trial that has already taken place, the correct legal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.084" offset="1663666">Now -- but none of the values which the Double Jeopardy Clause is designed to serve are impaired by our --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="395.865" offset="1686862">In this case Mr. Frey could that be done by simply reinstating the guilty verdict and entering judgment on it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="404.731" stopTime="466.502">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="404.731" offset="1722284">Well yes, you would the direct District Court presumably if it was wrong in its ruling to enter a judgment on the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.327" offset="1752691">Now of course there maybe -- again there maybe other post trial motions which the District Court would wish to consider before entering a final judgment such as a motion for a new trial which he never reached because of the grounds on which he concluded the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.494" offset="1813400">But it's perfectly clear it seems to me that the jury has found the facts, and has found them favorably to the government and in this sense the situation is not as different.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.666" offset="1866062">We are not contending that we're in a materially stronger position in this case than we would be in the Jenkins case, although one could possibly seek to make a distinction between jury and non-jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.304" offset="1916635">In the Jenkins case, the judge acted in two functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.123" offset="1931891">He performed the jury's function as a finder of fact and he performed his judicial function and it's there that he went wrong and it was his error in performing the judicial function --</text>

            <text syncTime="482.792" offset="2034500">I don't think that there was a motion for dismissal of the indictment as such, but that is the relief that he granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.539" offset="2061563">Of course, under Rule 12 he was required to consider an act on that prior to trial and he did consider an act on it prior to trial and denied it and there's some question about his power subsequent to trial to reopen that matter or whether if he's once denied at prior to trial only the appellate court can argue --</text>

            <text syncTime="575.560" offset="2405648">I think yes, there are certain forms of relief that he can grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.938" offset="2439084">In the Green case, Mr. Justice Black discussed some of the policies of the Double Jeopardy Clause, the interests that are served that we say are not adversely affected by government appeal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.206" offset="2496240">He began at page 187 of 355 U.S. by saying, “The constitutional prohibition against Double Jeopardy was designed to protect an individual from being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense.�?</text>
            <text syncTime="614.748" offset="2562382">Then after quoting from Blackstone and from ex parte Lange, he said the underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence is that the state with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal, and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety, and insecurity as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he maybe found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.074" offset="2691636">Now, we submit that these interests are not at stake in the government's appeal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.833" offset="2714728">Now, what Justice Black was clearly talking about was the situation in the Ball case and in cases of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.275" offset="2752449">Now also I had note that even in the context of a second trial, following a legally erroneous acquittal, Mr. Justice Cardozo observed in Palko against Connecticut and here I refer to Palko because of its relevance to the constitutional policies that are at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.167" offset="2832071">The State is not attempting to wear the accused out by a multitude of cases with accumulated trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.842" offset="2854745">It asked no more than this that the case against him shall go on until there shall be a trial free from the corrosion of substantial legal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.851" offset="2886823">This is not cruelty at all nor even vexation in any immoderate degree.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="700.892" offset="2906990">Of course, Palko in effect said you could have a rational system of jurisprudence without the Double Jeopardy Clause, didn't it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="707.899" offset="2934993">Well, it said that the core value of the Double Jeopardy Clause that would be transmitted to the states under the notion of Palko through the Due Process Clause would be basically the Ball notion that a man who has been tried and acquitted on the facts, can't be subjected to a second prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="726.620" offset="3009808">But presumably, even if Palko were still a law, we would be dealing in the federal system as we are here now with the core notion, but with the Double Jeopardy Clause itself?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="735.384" offset="3044916">Yes, I understand that and I don't mean to suggest in alluding to Palko that he meant to exclude the possibility of other considerations because one of the things that happened in the Palko opinion, was that he discussed Kepner.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.501" offset="3093400">And in discussing Kepner, he -- the Court refrained from overruling Kepner, but it did clearly indicate in its discussion that it had a great deal of sympathy for Justice Holmes' views in Kepner.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.331" offset="3148675">Now, the Court could have decided Palko by overruling Kepner.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.273" offset="3160482">It instead took the course of saying that that to the extent Kepner imposes more than this core notion, adds more to the Double Jeopardy Clause in this core notion, that added ingredient is not applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.007" offset="3227355">And of course, in Benton against Maryland in which Palko was overruled, as Justice Harlan pointed out in dissent, what Maryland had tried to do came within this core notion and the case could have been decided on due process grounds, what Maryland did was indefensible even on those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.813" offset="3298617">Now, the result reached by the Court of Appeals in this case, if enshrined as a constitutional holding by this Court, will create serious illogicality and will be wholly inconsistent with recognized law and other related instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.578" offset="3357654">I think the clearest instance that comes to mind is the instance of Supreme Court review of acquittals by Courts of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.995" offset="5587362">It did not allege errors of law in the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.916" offset="5603035">It said that the judge of the Court of First Instance had made a mistake when he concluded that he had a reasonable doubt about Kepner's fraudulent intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.015" offset="5643473">And the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court of the Philippines, whose opinion is also reproduced here, stated quite clearly that it did not on the evidence believe Mr. Kepner's story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.817" offset="5714631">Well, when this case reached the Supreme Court, the conclusion of the Court although there is a lengthy discussion of the general subject of appeals, the conclusion of the Court is with reference to the Ball case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.669" offset="5778056">It says it establishes that to try a man, now I'm looking at page 30 of our brief in Jenkins, “To try a man after a verdict of acquittal is to put him twice in jeopardy although the verdict was not followed by a judgment.�?</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.837" offset="5830719">This, said the Supreme Court in Kepner is practically the case under consideration viewed in the most favorable aspect for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.101" offset="5855796">The Court of First Instance having jurisdiction to try the question of guilt or innocence of the accused, found Kepner not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.333" offset="5884740">To try him again upon the merits even in an appellate court, is to put him a second time in jeopardy for the same offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.492" offset="6569357">Now, we don't agree in Wilson that you had the same beast for reasons that I am not going to be able to get to but that are addressed at length in our brief, but we say that the determination in Sisson, the statement which was one paragraph in the course of a lengthy and complicated opinion in which Mr. Justice White noted in his dissent, he didn't believe the Court could seriously mean as a constitutional holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.004" offset="6663398">We think that that dictum ought not to be followed by this Court and I would note that that dictum came about in a case which as Justice Harlan himself noted in Sisson.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip D. Lauer</label>
            <text syncTime="1675.534" offset="6805504">Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.834" offset="6818670">It's the opinion of the petitioner I should say, I'm sorry, it's the submission of the respondent in this matter and I understand that too have been the submission of the respondent in the matter heard by you just previously, that the position of the government would require if accepted by you, a holding that would be too narrow on double jeopardy grounds for reasonable application in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.451" offset="6925145">We have heard this morning and again this afternoon of the government's feeling that in this particular case and in the Jenkins case which preceded it, that you could in effect allow an appeal despite the provisions of the Double Jeopardy Clause for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.362" offset="7000795">First they present to you the proposition that to do so, would not violate, or actually would not even implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause because there would be no retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.744" offset="7058369">Prior to -- following that through if I may, I'd like to recite however something before it slips away from me altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.486" offset="7085328">There is, I think one other fact that I would like to add to the factual discussion made thus far by Mr. Frey and that is that, in its review -- in its order of the Court which took the form of memorandum of opinion, the District Judge referred extensively, we submit, to trial testimony and I think that that is important for reasons which I will try to develop during the course of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.782" offset="7194520">Namely that, the judge did not simply as is urged in the brief of the petitioner, rely upon facts which were found at pretrial hearing, and we also submit that it's impossible to intelligently find that the facts of that pretrial hearing were the same facts which were ultimately found or which were ultimately presented at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.246" offset="7280306">It's our opinion and we've set it forth in the brief, I believe in some detail, that the facts taken at the trial and the facts upon which the Court relied in its opinion were considerably greater in volume, considerably more varied at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.607" offset="7345821">It also seems apparent and I will come back to this, it seems apparent that the District Judge prior to trial having heard this argument and heard some testimony on two occasions concluded on both of those occasions that there were no facts at least which were satisfactory to him to warrant consideration, favorable consideration of our pretrial motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.933" offset="7431084">However, and this is intimated in the petitioner's brief, he must have changed his mind for some reason and the government would conclude that it was simply a change of mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2574.856" offset="10402774">It's been stated in a recent Harvard Law Review article that I believed was written sometime after the briefs in this case were filed or at least about the same time, that perhaps in these kinds of cases, the question of when jeopardy attaches is no longer a relevant inquiry or at least not a relevant inquiry in this kind of case, because it's the kind of inquiry which is very relevant in cases involving premature mistrials, in the Perez or Illinois v. Summerville cases, but perhaps that's not a relevant inquiry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.048" offset="10527535">What we're suggesting to you is that that kind of inquiry is relevant in this particular case for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.726" offset="10558255">We think that there is no question that jeopardy has attached in Mr. Wilson's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.668" offset="10582079">Assuming the technical jeopardy terms about which there was much discussion, Mr. Justice White's dissenting opinion in Sisson, there's no question we have technical jeopardy in that a jury was empaneled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.934" offset="10627114">The jury in fact heard the whole case, rendered the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.279" offset="10644459">What we're suggesting is that upon the granting of an acquittal, if that's in fact what this order was, in fact the jeopardy was there upon terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.440" offset="10677164">The defendant at that point in time was no longer in a position of jeopardy and that bringing him back or after a successful appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, is once again going to expose him to the kinds of risk which constitute jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.054" offset="10755636">The situation which has developed in this case is indicative of this we believe, but we think that it's important to keep this kind of a test in mind in determining whether or not Double Jeopardy's principles are going to be violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.213" offset="10816240">Now the government says, “Unless you go back for a trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause will not be implicated and you will not be violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.�?</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.730" offset="10854275">And we respectfully submit that that is not sensible, it is not logical, and it does not follow the Double Jeopardy Clause for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.575" offset="10885622">This Court has said for instance in Price versus Georgia and I believe in the Chief Justice's opinion as I recall, that the twice put in jeopardy language of the Constitution thus, relates to a potential i.e. the risk that an accused for a second time will be convicted of the same offense for which he was initially tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.460" offset="10973184">There are other references in our brief and elsewhere to the fact that, that although this kind of situation obviously arises most frequently where there in fact has been a second trial and perhaps a second conviction, that to implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause, you need not have that kind of a situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.440" offset="11405145">Now obviously, where the defendant has initiated the review and this is -- there are many cases covering this, where the defendant has initiated the review himself by himself asking for a new trial, that is a different circumstance because this Court has held and there are many other cases thoroughly talking about it that the defendant has in fact waived his right to even discuss the question of Double Jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.016" offset="11503470">But if you have a situation not unlike this one, where the Court for reasons that and I think that perhaps a better -- perhaps not an example of what you're talking about but another kind of issue with which we are very much concern, is supposing the trial judge for some reason had heard the matter, perhaps without the jury, and at the conclusion of the testimony of the government which clearly made out the offense, the defense rested without presenting any testimony and the judge thereafter enters a verdict of not guilty and even an explicated verdict of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.155" offset="11647979">What I'm suggesting to you is that there is -- regardless of how the judge comes to that decision, it's not critical whether or not -- it's not critical in this discussion, whether or not it's labeled anything in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.853" offset="11718823">It is critical we would submit, whether or not the defense through some reason of his own has waived the Double Jeopardy question or whether you get into a question of manifest necessity, or one of the reasons why Double Jeopardy has been found not to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.051" offset="11767620">But we would say that if the defendant through none of his conduct waived it and if the Court in considering the matter, used trial testimony, used fundamental issues, I'm sorry, fundamental testimony in the case going to the fundamental issue in the case, then we would submit that you have a situation where it is not appealable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.288" offset="12156531">But the very fundamental principle that they are putting to you in this matter is that it is strictly a question of law and that's the reason, if I may submit so and if I may raise my voice to that extent, that's the reason why you're being asked to allow this matter to go back and simply correct a pure error of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.270" offset="12232495">We would submit that that is not the case in this case and that it's almost hard to dream of a case where that is true.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.823" offset="12306683">The obvious answer to that line of reasoning is well, yes there were factual matters which had to be resolved but in the end, where the judge made his mistake was the application of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.682" offset="13358059">And in fact, I would submit that implicit in that argument is if the Court had not explained to the Court of Appeals or to the world at large why it had made an error that it would not have been appealable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.423" offset="13441024">But I do believe that the government's position is that it gets this ability to ask you to correct these kinds of errors from the fact that the decision is purely legal and we're submitting that that's just simply not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.723" offset="13502255">There is almost -- a friend once concluded that he felt like a beggar at a banquet and there's an incredible issue number of issues to cover here and it's obvious that were not going to reach them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.981" offset="13571323">I would like if I may to talk very briefly about some of the rest of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.423" offset="13613014">The government has referred repeatedly to Kepner, Fong Foo, United States versus Ball and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.954" offset="13651153">We agree that United States versus Ball, that the language in United States versus Ball which has been referred to was not language which was the holding of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.083" offset="13695666">However, we submit that since that time that very language has become the holding of this Court, repeatedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.938" offset="13723146">And we feel that in particular, to get to the government's point, you're not only going to have to reconsider cases such as Sisson, but you're going to have to consider and I would submit overrule Fong Foo in order to get to the point that the government would take you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.784" offset="13786467">Fong Foo is an interesting case because clearly that case would have required a second trial, there isn't any question about that, but the characterization as an acquittal was certainly, eminently attackable in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.896" offset="13842996">It was characterized as I recall it as being egregiously erroneous, nonetheless, the acquittal was left to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.454" offset="13869223">Now that decision, if there ever was one, was a complete total error of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.389" offset="13892942">There was no legal justification whatever for what the judge did, no matter what he might have concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.081" offset="13919692">He could of concluded black was white in that case or he could have been correct about everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.130" offset="13939858">It could not have affected the fact that he made a complete total, as I read the opinion, and as I've read the lower court's opinions, a complete and total error of law was committed in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.633" offset="13981863">And this Court did not permit itself to be taken at that time as far as the government would take you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.482" offset="14001298">I'm not certain, quite frankly that that issue was raised quite the same way, but this Court did not allow itself at that time to be taken that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.443" offset="14037138">We would submit that to go where the government takes you today, is going to require a complete reconsideration and overruling in fact of Fong Foo.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.488" offset="14121357">I've indicated it very briefly but we do not believe and we've tried to explain in a brief that there is a necessity for a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.006" offset="14155421">Second trial -- let me state it this way, second trial is the most obvious situation that can occur where the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated and in fact it's the only situation that's going to get to you, because if a defendant is merely indicted and the indictment is somehow overcome through the efforts of defense counsel, in all likelihood it's not going to reach this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.363" offset="14240789">What happens is that where people become indicted, where the government, where there is a termination of one kind or another which would implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause and the government comes back and it reaches a trial stage then you're confronted it with the Double Jeopardy case in this Court or in Appeals Court along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.804" offset="14306617">We're suggesting you don't have to get to that point however to implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3563.053" offset="14355623">Well, I'll try to cover the ground I have very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.986" offset="14367326">First of all with respect to the Sisson formula of what is an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.773" offset="14390418">It's not necessarily to be read the way the Court of Appeals read it because it says if it's an acquittal, if it's a legal determination on the basis of facts adduced at trial relating to the general issue of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.572" offset="14437648">Now, the Court of Appeals assumed that the word relating related to the facts adduced to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.928" offset="14463039">I submit that the correct way to read the formula in Sisson is that the word relating relates to legal determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.980" offset="14487280">It must be the legal determination that relates to the merits, and as Marion makes clear the determination that was made here was not a legal determination on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.448" offset="14537122">This is a legal ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.636" offset="14541928">We are not challenging any facts that the District Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.523" offset="14553422">We're not saying he was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.744" offset="14558333">We accept every fact and we say it is a matter of law, the facts that he found don't warrant the action that he took.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.899" offset="14595009">Now with respect to Fong Foo, I think it is in fact the case that in Fong Foo one of the things that the trial judge did however wrong and however much he shouldn't have done it, was to say that on the basis of what he had heard no jury could credit the government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.158" offset="14668048">That is he was ruling on a question in power, on the question of credibility he said, no jury could convict on the basis of the evidence that had been --</text>

            <text syncTime="3666.819" offset="14770657">But we think that's clearly in other case and we haven't asked for it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.483" offset="14793331">Now, I think I'd like to close by referring the Court to what Judge Learned Hand said in the Zisblatt case again which is at page 17 of our brief in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.691" offset="14854144">He said basically that, “Although, the Constitution gives an accused person the benefit of any mistakes in his favor of the first jury he encounters whether it has passed upon as guilt or not, it does not extend that privilege to mistakes in his favor by the judge.�?</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.106" offset="14915793">And I would like to ask the Court in deciding this case to consider why respondent Wilson should be insulated from the punishment prescribed by law, if the District Court was wrong in its ruling.</text>
